00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: We all know
that our family dynamics create

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
deep programs within us that are
difficult to break and can even

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
compromise or ruin the
quality of our lives.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:84%
But what if we could go
back and re-create them

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:90%
in a three-dimensional sense?

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what Family Constellation
Therapy facilitates,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
a recognition and re-creation
of the broken dynamics that

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:90%
have held us back.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Elmar Dornberger, who has been
a facilitator for more than a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
decade, has seen resolutions
that, I would say,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:90%
are just short of miraculous.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And welcome here to
share this with us.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:90%
I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I've been curious about
this for quite some time.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And actually, my son was in
a group that was doing this

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and said, mom, you've
got to check this out.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:90%
This is really powerful stuff.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happened
I had just contacted you,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.970 align:middle line:84%
so the universe was
working in sync.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to
know, first of all,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:84%
this is a modality that
came out of Germany.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
What was the original basis
of it, the original protocols

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:90%
and basis and thought behind it?

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.946 align:middle line:84%
>> ELMAR DORNBERGER:
First, thank you, Regina,

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:90%
for having me on the show.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So a person named
Bert Hellinger,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
he's the founder
of this modality.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And he used to live in Africa
and worked with the Zulus

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed that when
there were issues in the tribe

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:84%
or in families, they would
always honor the ancestors.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So they would look
back to the ancestors

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and notice if there
was anything that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
might have been passed
from the ancestors

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
to that particular
person or family.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So he noticed that there was
great worship done and honoring

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to the whole family lineage
and actually to both the living

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:90%
and to the dead.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So he noticed that the
dead are not necessarily

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
no longer present.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So there was actually some kind
of an energy form still existed

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:90%
even in the present family.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And later on he studied many
modalities actually here

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, and then
he started combining them.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And so Family
Constellation is really

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:84%
a combination of
different modalities,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
but it did come from
this idea that patterns

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
are being passed down
to us from ancestors.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which
makes total sense.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.652 align:middle line:84%
It's been thought that a lot
of our emotions and thought

00:02:56.652 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and so forth are connected --
and experience are connected

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.549 align:middle line:90%
in with the DNA, right?

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.756 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this would make
sense that we have inherited

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
certain of these maybe deep
familial memories and patterns

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
and behaviors.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.731 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And especially in the
last 5 to 10 years

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
science has almost kind of
caught up with this modality.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
been proven now

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
that DNA carries more than
just structural things

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:90%
but also emotional aspects.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
birth trauma, for one.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start
the journey of life.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to show a little
video, which is just something

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed off of
YouTube that has

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
people kind of going
through a session.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.864 align:middle line:84%
But to someone new to it,
they'd say, what are they doing?

00:03:41.864 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
give us the kind

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.667 align:middle line:90%
of symbolic elements of that.

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, what
happens in our birth?

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
people who have been

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
able to go back to
the birth process find

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:90%
it was very traumatic.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem to be
part of a process that's

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
natural to our species, that's
lovingly embraced and gone

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
through with grace
on both sides.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.946 align:middle line:84%
It always seems there's some
sort of trauma around it.

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: I think birth
in itself is a process.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if birth
in itself is trauma.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.175 align:middle line:84%
But we know that there
are aspects around birth

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:90%
that can be traumatic.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's say if a
baby is immediately

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:90%
taken away from mom.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it,
this baby has been with mom

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:84%
for nine months, and suddenly
she's just ripped away.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And this baby doesn't
know where am I now.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Is this is a safe place?

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I was safe before, and
now suddenly I'm alone.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.802 align:middle line:90%
And now am I still safe?

00:04:42.802 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.916 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So very often
when I work with clients

00:04:45.916 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and something like
this comes up,

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:84%
then we actually
explore what was it?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:84%
What were the details of birth
or what happened around it

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.045 align:middle line:90%
that were possibly traumatic.

00:04:57.045 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:90%
That make sense.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So to set things up, let's look
at what maybe a standard 3D

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.747 align:middle line:84%
group experience
might look like.

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Sure.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.205 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And these
are just pictures.

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:90%
So what do we have here?

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.188 align:middle line:84%
We have people on the
side and these two people

00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:14.631 align:middle line:90%
that seem to be the main people.

00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So since this
is not my constellation,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
but I could imagine maybe
this represents-- very often,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
actually, in a group there are
strangers that come together.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And then one person is a client.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the client,
sometimes they

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
choose other representatives to
represent parts of their family

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
system, or whatever they are
struggling with at the moment.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So earlier we saw
these two women.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one was
representing herself,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and maybe one was
representing her mom.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.461 align:middle line:84%
And these others could be other
parts of the family system.

00:05:49.461 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they can
be just surrogates.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:90%
They can be--

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes, exactly.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --people
from within the group.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.431 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And these people, usually
they don't know anything

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.400 align:middle line:84%
about the client or
their background.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.465 align:middle line:84%
And often even the
facilitator knows very little.

00:06:03.465 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes there is
maybe a one-minute or maybe

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.577 align:middle line:84%
a five-minute interview
before the process starts.

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So nobody
really knows the details.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
through these formations

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
that kind of sometimes
naturally occur

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes also a facilitator
might probe something.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:84%
They might say, how about if
you stand in this formation,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:90%
and we'll notice what comes out?

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's not really
a prescribed process.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But this
is the 3D part of it.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.451 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Placing real people
in real space approximate

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:90%
to the individual.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And what actually
happens then when we stand

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
in somebody else's
place, believe it or not,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:84%
we actually can start feeling
what that person actually felt

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.009 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just by
standing in their place?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Just by
standing in their place.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.089 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if you've
heard of Rupert Sheldrake.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I know Rupert,
and I've interviewed him

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:90%
as well, yes.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful work.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So he talks
about the morphic field.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.973 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And this is
almost sort of an application

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
of the morphic field, where we
actually through an arrangement

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
of energies, each
person is an energy,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
we create an energy field.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And that field becomes alive.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And that field then actually
represents the family system.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever actually
somebody says in that place

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is as close as it can be to
what that person would actually

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:90%
be saying.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.478 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So would this also
have to do with the fact that

00:07:44.478 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
these people have come together
with this particular intention,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.279 align:middle line:84%
so they've opened
themselves to that field?

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it really can be
as simple as we're here to do

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.780 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And then if you have an
open heart or an open mind,

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:90%
you step into that.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you're playing
out what the dynamic may

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:84%
have been in that family, as
you say, through the field

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.649 align:middle line:90%
you're absorbing real truths.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.831 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this happens
a lot with strangers.

00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:90%
The truth starts coming out.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And at times,
I even had skeptics showing up

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:84%
who didn't think that
this was really true.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked them, so
you can just participate,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and if you feel like
you want to step in

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and you want to be
a representative,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:90%
feel free to do so.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And every time even
a skeptic stepped in,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
the same thing happened.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.233 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:32.899 align:middle line:90%
That's powerful.

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.333 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So it's not
necessary that you have

00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:39.199 align:middle line:84%
to believe in it or you have
to be psyched up for it or you

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:41.091 align:middle line:84%
have to have positive
feelings towards it.

00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You just have to
choose to be part of that

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:44.792 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
birth a little bit.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into our early
infancy and the area

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.185 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about
called blind love.

00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:54.976 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:08:54.976 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.167 align:middle line:90%
You have children?

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I have one son.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: We all
have been children.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
when parents give us life,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
we come to this world, we
have very little to nothing

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:84%
really to give back
to our parents.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
They give us love.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.695 align:middle line:90%
They give us shelter.

00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:90%
They give us food.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:90%
They protect us.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:90%
They spend money for us.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing really
we can give in return.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any money.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't have really
anything to give to them.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we do give, and what
pretty much every child does,

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:84%
is to have love for our
parents, to have empathy,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.755 align:middle line:90%
to have compassion.

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And this can actually
go as extreme

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
as if there is an
issue in the marriage

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
or in the relationship,
the child is actually

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:90%
trying to step in to save that.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.530 align:middle line:84%
There's also another
aspect why this

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
is happening too
is because we are

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:84%
both 50% our mother
and our father.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.422 align:middle line:84%
So whatever they are feeling,
we can feel into that.

00:10:09.422 --> 00:10:11.171 align:middle line:84%
So we have empathy for
that, and it almost

00:10:11.171 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is our own feelings get
triggered through that.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So when our mother is
hurt, we want to step in,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:90%
and we want to help.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And this goes as far as
that sometimes children,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
they sacrifice themselves for
the love of their parents.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Like when
children act out in schools,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
when they maybe even
reach out for drugs,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:41.471 align:middle line:84%
when they are
failing in classes,

00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
when they act out
with other children,

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
very often this actually
comes from a place of love.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Because they want
that the parents

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:90%
are coming back together again.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So when I act out, when
I'm sick, when I'm home

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.035 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying, I can't
go to school, I'm sick,

00:10:58.035 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:90%
the parents immediately show up.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So they know when I'm doing
something that is actually

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
against the grain
or against what

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to do the
parents will respond.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.872 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's interesting is
if we now live in an era where

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:84%
a very high percentage of
the homes are broken homes,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.204 align:middle line:84%
where parents have left
each other and children are

00:11:17.204 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:90%
in single-parent families.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
When you work, depending
on the generation,

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
with people, is it the
same dynamic or different

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
between families
that are together

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:84%
but dysfunctional and
unhappy versus those

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
who have chosen to
split apart because they

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.106 align:middle line:90%
don't want the dysfunction?

00:11:37.106 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Right.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is there a distinct
flavor of the impact on us,

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:90%
as the child?

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Sure.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I want to say for the
child it's always difficult

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:90%
if family splits.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.002 align:middle line:84%
Because for them, they
feel like I have to split,

00:11:55.002 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:90%
because part of me is my mom.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have
to be loyal to both.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.031 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:90%
And how can I be loyal?

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And especially if
one partner speaks

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
bad about the other
partner, because then,

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:84%
again, that hurts the child,
because the child, again,

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:90%
is both mother and father, 50%.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, when
there is a positive break,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
meaning that both parents really
hold this in their highest

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:84%
esteem, in their
best intentions,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:84%
it can be OK for the child,
that the child does not

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
feel like I have to choose
and one time I'm over here

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and my life is different
than when I'm with my mother

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.130 align:middle line:90%
or with my father.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And if that can be
regulated in a way

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that the child is just switching
homes, just switching a room,

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
switching a building versus
having to totally adjust

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
to a totally different
lifestyle, then, I think,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
a child can still be very
productive and very positive

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.644 align:middle line:90%
and not damaged.

00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically,
whether a family actually

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.169 align:middle line:84%
splits up or doesn't, it's
the tension and dysfunction

00:13:04.169 --> 00:13:06.085 align:middle line:84%
in the family that seems
to be the difference.

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:07.202 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:13:07.202 --> 00:13:08.054 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hmm.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So you have all
these little-- well,

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
they look like little
clothespin toys here,

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:90%
little people, little families.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:84%
A see a little hat
on one of them.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.488 align:middle line:90%
Must be dad.

00:13:19.488 --> 00:13:21.242 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: There you are.

00:13:21.242 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So who
are these people?

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And what are you going
to show us with this?

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So the reason I
brought these is because I do

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:90%
this work three different ways.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:90%
I work with families.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.970 align:middle line:90%
I also work with individuals.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:90%
I work with couples.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:90%
I also work with organizations.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I have clients
who don't necessarily

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
want to go to a group setting.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be
exposed to 20 strangers.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And they feel more I want to do
this in the privacy of just one

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:84%
single person that
I'm working with.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of
created these tools.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I have two sides
here, these are kind of people

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and these are things, is
because, as you kind of saw

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
before in the
three-dimensional world

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:84%
when we work with actual
people, they can speak.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we can ask them
about, how do you feel?

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you stand here and
your father stands next to you,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.640 align:middle line:90%
how does it make you feel?

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And your mother stands over
there, how do you feel?

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have sort of
a dialogue, and we

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
can start understanding
what the dynamics is.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we work
one-on-one, we work

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:90%
with dead wood, so to speak.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no communication here.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So I
devised these parts here.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.724 align:middle line:84%
This is all pieces of
wood, and some of them,

00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:90%
they look like a tree.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Little tree, yeah.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And some, they're
a little bit more smooth.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So if we use these elements
and we say, OK, so this is me,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.585 align:middle line:84%
this is my dad, and
I have a conflict.

00:14:56.585 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So I can't really--
as a facilitator

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't quite figure out
what kind of conflict is this

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and where is it and who
owns it and how big is it.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I just use these
pieces and I ask them,

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:84%
so would you mind
just picking something

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:90%
that shows me your conflict?

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody takes this and
says, so this is my conflict,

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I get sort of a sense
of what this might be.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.654 align:middle line:84%
They might also choose this
and say, this is the conflict.

00:15:27.654 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a much more potent
conflict, it looks like.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So we
have a different sense.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Then my next question
or one of the questions

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
could be, this
seems to be so big,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:84%
you can hardly even
look over this.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.177 align:middle line:84%
You can't even see your
dad because this is so big.

00:15:47.177 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it gives
you a starting place.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Exactly.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And very often when I work
with clients they say,

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:90%
well, I don't know how I feel.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean you
want to know how I feel?

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:90%
It's complicated, you know?

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:90%
I love him and I hate him.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so you love him
and you hate him.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.115 align:middle line:90%
So is this the hate?

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So what would the
love look like?

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.385 align:middle line:84%
Well, the love would be
maybe-- and they look around.

00:16:14.385 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I see a
little tiny log there.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yeah.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, actually this
is a smallest here.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.595 align:middle line:84%
So they might take this, and
then they might put this here.

00:16:22.595 --> 00:16:24.931 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see.

00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So we
actually start having

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:90%
a three-dimensional arrangement.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And
then very often,

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
when there's a conflict with
dad there's also a conflict with

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:90%
mom.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:90%
It's never just only one person.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.965 align:middle line:84%
It's always a triangle, or it's
always more than one thing.

00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So if I would ask, so
where's mom in this?

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.174 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
mom is over here.

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
she's looking away.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.548 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Exactly.

00:16:51.548 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Mm hmm.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So the reason
they have eyes is so we

00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:84%
immediately can tell
what is the dynamics?

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.590 align:middle line:90%
What's really happening here?

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.359 align:middle line:84%
So believe it or not, within
probably less than five

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:84%
minutes, when somebody
starts working with this,

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:90%
this becomes their reality.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.383 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:17:12.383 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:90%
I can see that.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:14.919 align:middle line:90%
This tells a lot right here.

00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The father
and the child facing off.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.556 align:middle line:84%
This huge thing that's
grown between them.

00:17:21.556 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Mom's looking the other way and
distanced from the whole thing.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.744 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's love there,
but it's not that accessible.

00:17:26.744 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:28.275 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:28.275 --> 00:17:29.085 align:middle line:90%
It's not obvious.

00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.294 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that
that's very cool.

00:17:31.294 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So actually
within one session,

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I can get so much information
that would take me weeks,

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Because how
would you describe the issue?

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
How would you describe
this in words?

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason why
this person probably chose

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:55.552 align:middle line:84%
this versus this can be
because this is complicated.

00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: This is complex.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.216 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And this just
has one little thing here.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.044 align:middle line:84%
So this gives us a very
different kind of feel.

00:18:03.044 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:90%
I like the way this feels.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
It's very visceral,
and it brings up

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.980 align:middle line:84%
representative
feelings appropriately.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.167 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:18:12.167 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And then we can
ask, maybe at a later stage,

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:24.180 align:middle line:84%
so if this is resolved, if
this would not be here anymore,

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.056 align:middle line:90%
what happens to this?

00:18:26.056 --> 00:18:27.567 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Well, you
know, I'm not quite sure.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still kind of
skeptical, and it's

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:84%
going to take
something from him.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.387 align:middle line:90%
So what is it going to take?

00:18:35.387 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, he's
always distanced,

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.825 align:middle line:90%
and I really need him closer.

00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:90%
So how close do you need him?

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I need him,
like, really close.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.009 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
I need him actually here.

00:18:48.009 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't need him to look at me.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I need him actually next to me.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:90%
And then, so what about this?

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, of course, you know,
well, I think it would maybe

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:90%
it would be something like that.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Aw.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:90%
It's really very sweet.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:90%
It's very innocent in doing it.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.647 align:middle line:84%
It brings up personal feelings,
but it's non-personal,

00:19:09.647 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
non-threatening the way you've
done that, the way you've

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:90%
constructed it.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is what you
would do for someone

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.524 align:middle line:84%
who is working with you
directly, just one-on-one,

00:19:17.524 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
without bringing all the
other people into it.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.282 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:19:20.282 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Does fear come up?

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Do people feel really
vulnerable when

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:84%
they're with the other
people in a group?

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.151 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Sometimes.

00:19:26.151 --> 00:19:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't necessarily
know what's going to come out.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And especially if you have
a stranger representing

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
your family system, and if
it's very entangled or very

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
dysfunctional, there could be
a lot of stuff just coming out.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And that process--
unfortunately, we

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.840 align:middle line:84%
don't have a live video
of how something really

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
happens-- it can get very vocal,
and it can be very personal.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So somebody might actually
really stand up and say,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I hate you because somebody
in the family system

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:90%
actually feels that.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you sit
there as a client,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.672 align:middle line:84%
and you might be sitting
on the side watching this,

00:20:08.672 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
this is sometimes a
little bit hard to see.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's sometimes a
little bit shocking.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And then also what can happen
is when this comes a little bit

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
fast, you might
kind of shut down.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.329 align:middle line:84%
So this is safer, with
inanimate objects.

00:20:23.329 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And because I don't
touch these anymore,

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.362 align:middle line:84%
I have just the client
play with them--

00:20:31.362 --> 00:20:33.497 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it doesn't
put your energy in--

00:20:33.497 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yeah.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, when I
started this out, I would say,

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.580 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, why
don't you try this out?

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.130 align:middle line:84%
What would it be if you
would have a resource here?

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And immediately they would
be like, what are you doing?

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: They would get
really physical and emotional.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.924 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because you
were choosing for them

00:20:49.924 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:90%
their experience.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And
this was their field.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:90%
I was intruding in their field.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%
It was like, don't do that.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
This is me, and
this is my field.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:90%
You can't get in there.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, also, it
really kind of works

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
on their speed, whatever
they're ready to do.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
If they're not ready actually
to talk about this yet,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:90%
they won't.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's juxtapose
this to classical therapy,

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
talk therapy and timeframes
and effectiveness and so forth.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.984 align:middle line:84%
Why were you drawn to
this kind of therapy?

00:21:27.984 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: A couple
of different reasons.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So, I started out
doing regular therapy.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I found after less than two
years I started to burn out.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a very
empathetic person, and so

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I would actually take
all this with me.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the session,
at the end of the day,

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I would have my backpack
full with all of this,

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
with all my clients,
all this stuff.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:90%
So that was one reason.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know, really,
how to unload this.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:84%
How do you unload
this on a daily basis?

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And the second reason was
also the effectiveness.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
It would take me a long time
to actually find the truth.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And this might sound a little
bit harsh, but most of clients

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.535 align:middle line:84%
when they first come
and see a therapist,

00:22:23.535 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:90%
they don't tell you the truth.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.072 align:middle line:84%
I might have seen
a client for a half

00:22:30.072 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:84%
a year, maybe a year until they
finally will tell me, oh, I

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:90%
have these and these habits.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I just do this and
this on a regular basis.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like, excuse me?

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why didn't
you mention this?

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.324 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Didn't you
think this was important?

00:22:42.324 --> 00:22:47.482 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I didn't think about
it, or that was personal.

00:22:47.482 --> 00:22:48.148 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:48.148 --> 00:22:49.046 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is personal.

00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:49.452 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.109 align:middle line:90%
So you come to your therapist.

00:22:51.109 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you still have things
that are personal?

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't really
happen that much when

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:84%
we work with this, because
we just look at patterns.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:84%
We just look at
what is still here?

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Why is your mom over here?

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's this thing,
and then there is this thing.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of things,
because she's over here.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:23.105 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even have
to necessarily name it.

00:23:23.105 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So we just know,
OK, there's things.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
If they feel safe,
they can name it.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I have clients who it
didn't feel safe at first.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, so we can
just work with things,

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:84%
because we can
describe these things.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So why did you choose this
and you didn't choose this?

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And they will tell me,
well, this is broken.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:90%
This has different parts.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:90%
This looks kind of--

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sharp.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER:
--scary and sharp.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So they would just
describe the parts.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And by describing
the parts, they

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.425 align:middle line:84%
would actually describe
kind of what was going on--

00:24:01.425 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense, yes.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.244 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: --what the
feelings are around this.

00:24:05.244 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, now what
age group can you engage

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:90%
effectively in this?

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Beginning at what age?

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I would think little kids
would take to it like a duck

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:90%
to water, no problem.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.359 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I just recently had a girl
who was about six years old.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:30.885 align:middle line:84%
And initially she didn't want
to totally engage in this.

00:24:30.885 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I asked specific
questions about what

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.650 align:middle line:84%
was going on in the family
and the family system,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and she just wanted
to kind of play.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that she was
not going to engage with me.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:90%
That was not her style.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I just said,
why don't you just play?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:90%
So she started playing.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And within the play,
what actually came out

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:90%
was the family dynamics.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
She set up her mom,
she set up her dad,

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.230 align:middle line:84%
she set up her
grandfather, and then she

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
placed herself at a
very specific place.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.036 align:middle line:84%
And so we knew exactly
what was going on.

00:25:09.036 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Safe.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Safe.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Subconscious.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of people
have the greatest resistance

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.317 align:middle line:90%
to engage on this level?

00:25:20.317 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: It's hard to say.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's people who
are very much in their heads.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And they think they can really
just resolve things just

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:84%
by thinking, not
necessarily by feeling.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes this
takes a little while.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't take very long.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.280 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I start asking,
well, why this versus that, then

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:90%
they can describe this.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And when they
describe the pieces,

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:84%
they really start
describing feelings,

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
even if they didn't think
they can really feel

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
or they wanted to really
resolve this intellectually.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: But we know
that our body really stores

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:90%
our emotions.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we only do work here
and we don't touch this,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't really work.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.714 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really last.

00:26:07.714 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: This
needs to be part of it.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.596 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:10.596 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have the
cognizance of what's going on,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
if it's not integrated
into the emotions-- yeah,

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:90%
that makes sense.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to now show
us how a session flows,

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.990 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, where you begin
your line of questioning,

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, what does
a session begin like?

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So usually, I
have this out when somebody

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:90%
comes for the first time.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And I just tell them a
little bit about what I do,

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and these are my
partners, and I've

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
been working with
them for a long time.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
good at their job.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I would just
say, why don't you

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.820 align:middle line:84%
pick one for yourself
that would represent you?

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:90%
And there is no right or wrong.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing is
really kind of the game,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.851 align:middle line:84%
and the rules are actually
really your rules.

00:26:52.851 --> 00:26:53.725 align:middle line:90%
They're not my rules.

00:26:53.725 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
My engagement is more sort of
like being a facilitator that's

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a step
ahead, sometimes

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
a step behind,
but very close by.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just ask questions
for me to understand

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.784 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:27:09.784 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So why don't you
just pick one figure here that

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.940 align:middle line:90%
would represent you?

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.416 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:27:17.416 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I like that one with the hat.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Good.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And in case if you decide
later that this was not

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.704 align:middle line:84%
the right one, you can
always change them.

00:27:24.704 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.495 align:middle line:90%
It's a little hat.

00:27:26.495 --> 00:27:28.637 align:middle line:90%
I don't see any with hair.

00:27:28.637 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yeah.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:84%
They're either bald
or they have a hat.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Either bald or hat.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's kind of
a cute little hat.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:90%
There's a little hat.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So let's
say you have an issue.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
If that will be
resolved, your life

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.740 align:middle line:90%
would be a little bit easier.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can either name
or not name it, whatever.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I would ask you either
if it's an issue with a person

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:90%
you pick another person.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's an issue with
a thing, then you would--

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's more of a
behavioral thing that I just

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:90%
think is not effective.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not serving me any longer.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is when I
wake up in the morning,

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I immediately go
and check the email,

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
do research, do all these
things that are in the head.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I wake up with it
lot of thoughts

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and then engage in
the thought world

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and forget all about the
physical world, pretty much.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.515 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Right.

00:28:16.515 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then the
morning has gone on.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I haven't even
taken my pajamas off yet.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had any breakfast.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Now the big window for exercise
is already starting to pass.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I'm
too much in my head

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and not in a good
ritualistic way engaging

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to engage more
in physicality first thing.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:84%
There is not really a
roadmap, so I don't really

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:90%
have an answer.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an
answer for any problem

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:90%
that anybody comes to me.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But any problem that
exists I think actually

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.475 align:middle line:84%
comes already with
its own answer.

00:28:55.475 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:90%
I think that's true.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So it's
sort of like a co-arising.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.270 align:middle line:84%
There's the issue,
and then somewhere

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:90%
is also the resolution.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to kind of
stay with what actually is.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We stay with the issue,
and then we kind of notice

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:90%
what actually wants to happen.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like,
OK, this is you,

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.410 align:middle line:90%
and then there is the issue.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:90%
You want to be more embodied.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
more in your body,

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:84%
not immediately
going to your head.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like we're
going to go now from here

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
jump into the solution.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: That's usually
what coaching does and some

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.282 align:middle line:90%
of those modalities.

00:29:38.282 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
They kind of say, OK,
this is your issue.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's rah, rah, rah.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.426 align:middle line:90%
Where do you want to be?

00:29:42.426 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And then let's figure out
how will we get you there.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
The constellation work is more
about we actually kind of hang

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:84%
out in the issue
for little while.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:90%
So let's just kind of explore.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:90%
So what is the issue?

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.215 align:middle line:90%
The issue--

00:30:02.215 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: My brain's on fire
first thing in the morning.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Your
brain's on fire.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's choose something that
would represent your brain

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.014 align:middle line:90%
is on fire.

00:30:11.014 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.179 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:12.755 align:middle line:90%
That one.

00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's got a
lot of stuff going on.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:16.287 align:middle line:90%
You brain is on fire.

00:30:16.287 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: What else?

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's when I feel
most energized with mental task

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going to start in
on research, for example,

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I would be either starting
that or setting it up.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't really
set my day up yet.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.850 align:middle line:90%
So my brain's on fire.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
It just goes and
runs amok before I

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.065 align:middle line:84%
take the time to slow down
and integrate anything else.

00:30:40.065 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Right.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Solution focused.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to see-- let's
just take this away.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.904 align:middle line:84%
But that might
not actually work.

00:30:48.904 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No,
that wouldn't work.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Right.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So usually what is in our
life, even the things that

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.384 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily work for us,
they have a positive function.

00:31:01.384 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:90%
It has a positive function.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So we need
to look at also the positive

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.177 align:middle line:90%
function of this.

00:31:08.177 --> 00:31:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The positive function
is I can get a lot done early

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.990 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And the anxiety is if I
say, no, go out and do

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.180 align:middle line:84%
your walk or your
little things that you

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:24.350 align:middle line:84%
do for exercise and hike
with my little dog Ernie

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.970 align:middle line:84%
early in the morning
and so forth, an anxiety

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.220 align:middle line:84%
builds that I'm getting kind
of pushed away from the things

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:90%
that I have to do.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like time, time.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.681 align:middle line:90%
It represents time.

00:31:34.681 --> 00:31:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: You
just mentioned anxiety.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.216 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So let's
represent the anxiety.

00:31:39.216 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
one is the anxiety.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you mentioned
tasks that you need to do.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.860 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:84%
That would be maybe that
one with a lot of tree.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that one.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So now you have brain
on fire, anxiety, tasks.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER:
Anything else that--

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it
kind of stops there.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of research, and
I'm dyslexic, mildly dyslexic.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I always feel
on the edge of control.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to get
my research done

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:84%
on time, before I interview
you or someone, for example.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of it to do.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always feeling this
maybe artificial construct

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that I'm behind on my
mental tasks, my research.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.706 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Feeling behind.

00:32:36.706 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:90%
That's another part of this.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:38.558 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:32:38.558 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So we need
to have another piece.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.877 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:32:40.877 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of stuff.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.780 align:middle line:90%
That one is square.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.901 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.035 align:middle line:90%


00:32:49.035 --> 00:32:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So you see how complex
this already is.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
That's way more
complex than I thought.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.594 align:middle line:90%
I thought maybe I was lazy.

00:32:53.594 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.634 align:middle line:84%
Good to know I'm not
lazy, just screwed up.

00:32:59.634 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So there's a lot
going on before you actually

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:16.100 align:middle line:84%
get to do it or before you
actually-- here are the tasks.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.549 align:middle line:90%
So brain on fire, anxiety--

00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Anxiety.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.170 align:middle line:84%
If I take time
away from my brain

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.644 align:middle line:84%
to go take care of
the physical world,

00:33:24.644 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:84%
there's anxiety
that I'm not going

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:84%
to get it all done on
some subconscious level.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.124 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Right.

00:33:31.124 --> 00:33:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The reality
is I do get it done.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.050 align:middle line:90%
I do always get everything done.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:36.841 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:33:36.841 --> 00:33:41.359 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But that's the
mental part that is an illusion.

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So we still
haven't even set up what you

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
desire to do, which is
your physical activity.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To not have this
so I can do a little of this

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and then jump into this
comfortably without worrying

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.430 align:middle line:90%
about that getting done.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:02.285 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So let's set
up that physical activity.

00:34:02.285 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's funny,
because I don't know which piece

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.825 align:middle line:90%
to draw for that piece.

00:34:05.825 --> 00:34:06.575 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:34:06.575 --> 00:34:09.509 align:middle line:90%
How about if we-- we could try--

00:34:09.509 --> 00:34:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe
something like this.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:90%
It's more smooth.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:90%
There's no anxiety around it.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:14.487 align:middle line:90%
It's nice.

00:34:14.487 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:90%
It's pleasant.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.819 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:34:15.819 --> 00:34:17.366 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:17.366 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yeah.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.780 align:middle line:84%
My thought was we could use
maybe another figure for you

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.957 align:middle line:90%
as this other person.

00:34:22.957 --> 00:34:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that sounds
good, because I'm

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.850 align:middle line:90%
having a harder time with this.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So another person.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.491 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Select
which person would you be,

00:34:30.491 --> 00:34:32.949 align:middle line:84%
the person that would actually--
would do these activities.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:40.655 align:middle line:90%


00:34:40.655 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Maybe this one.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.659 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:84%
So notice would that
be the right place

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:53.270 align:middle line:84%
or if there's another
place for that person.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is a desire of
yours, to become that person.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And would you want
this on a daily basis?

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.505 align:middle line:84%
Or would you want this
just every once in a while?

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:08.838 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, pretty regularly.

00:35:08.838 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:84%
If not every day, most days,
to get in the habit of taking

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.801 align:middle line:84%
care of the physical
reality first.

00:35:14.801 --> 00:35:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Or at least, do that.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.075 align:middle line:90%
This is OK.

00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind the brain on
fire, and do a little bit.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.304 align:middle line:84%
But then be able to
disengage from it

00:35:24.304 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and then take care
of the physical

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.178 align:middle line:84%
and go back to
everything else that

00:35:27.178 --> 00:35:29.972 align:middle line:84%
becomes the rest of the day,
instead of pushing this off

00:35:29.972 --> 00:35:32.180 align:middle line:84%
to the end of the day, where
often it won't get done.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:90%


00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.801 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So there's times
where this does not happen.

00:35:38.801 --> 00:35:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's time where I don't
engage back in the physical,

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.400 align:middle line:84%
because it gets so late
in the day the day's gone.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And then I feel badly.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not good on
a lot of levels.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So we already
explored jumping from here

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.042 align:middle line:90%
to here.

00:35:54.042 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.089 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Past this.

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Past that.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes,
past this anxiety.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.856 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:00.856 --> 00:36:01.461 align:middle line:90%
Past that.

00:36:01.461 --> 00:36:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.865 align:middle line:84%
And so somewhere in here
before all of this--

00:36:04.865 --> 00:36:09.560 align:middle line:84%
this is just the complexity of
work, so that would be good.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.560 align:middle line:90%
So I'm moving forward.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:90%
They're all facing forward.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yeah.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if we can, since
we don't have a whole lot

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.021 align:middle line:84%
of time, at this point
what would happen,

00:36:20.021 --> 00:36:22.270 align:middle line:84%
since we don't have time to
do an actual real session?

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But I can see here
personally that this

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.870 align:middle line:84%
is way more complex than I
thought it was. [CHUCKLES]

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: It is.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So there would be
questions like, again,

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:84%
what's the positive aspect
of this, brain on fire?

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.135 align:middle line:84%
What's the positive
of the anxiety?

00:36:40.135 --> 00:36:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I don't know.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about what's
positive about anxiety, per se.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Sometimes
anxiety can be a drive.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:84%
When we feel anxious,
we feel like we kind of

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.726 align:middle line:90%
have to do something.

00:36:53.726 --> 00:36:54.850 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have to act.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:59.800 align:middle line:90%


00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But again, if anxiety
becomes too strong,

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.694 align:middle line:84%
then the actions are
sometimes not positive.

00:37:05.694 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And in this sense, it's just
kind of habitual almost.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.140 align:middle line:90%
It was subconscious.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know I had
any anxiety around that.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yeah.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So this process, as we
go deeper into this,

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:84%
it brings out more
details about what's

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.580 align:middle line:90%
actually really going on.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.205 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes we
think it's only this,

00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:90%
but there's other parts.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And we need to make sure
that all parts are actually

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.260 align:middle line:84%
addressed in a positive
way so that we don't just

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:90%
take something out.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if we take a habit
out without replacing it

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.894 align:middle line:84%
with something positive,
it will replace itself.

00:37:46.894 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I don't particularly
want to replace that.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I only want to eliminate
that to get to this.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:38:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And then that represents the
exercise thing, whatever,

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:84%
just the physicality, which
is getting into the day

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.930 align:middle line:84%
physically, which
is beyond exercise.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Then re-engage
with the physical,

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm ready
for all of this.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Then this doesn't really
cause much anxiety.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.675 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Right.

00:38:13.675 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's only if I'm
putting it off that it creates

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.430 align:middle line:90%
anxiety.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And so if I can feel
comfortable there, I'm cool.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So right now,
it just sort of looks to me

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
physically, spatially, that this
is in the way from getting from

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:90%
here to here.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.710 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.300 align:middle line:84%
It does appear that
way, doesn't it?

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:32.565 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:38:32.565 --> 00:38:33.065 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:33.065 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.530 align:middle line:84%
An obvious question
could be, would there

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:44.500 align:middle line:84%
be a place, without getting rid
of this, to move it to a place

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
where you're still engaging
with it and it's still there

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's not in your
way of getting there.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, to make
this engagement more brief

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and pointed, maybe, and then
leave the rest over in this

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.840 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
This is spilling over into
here is what's happening.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So could
you engage in this,

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.560 align:middle line:90%
acknowledge it in the morning.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So you get up and say,
oh, OK, I'm ready,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.384 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
just pause this.

00:39:17.384 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm paying attention to you.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:22.316 align:middle line:84%
Because this is very
important to you, because this

00:39:22.316 --> 00:39:23.440 align:middle line:90%
is part of your livelihood.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.750 align:middle line:90%
This is part of who you are.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.850 align:middle line:84%
This is part of how you
engage in your work.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So we do not want
to get rid of this.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So is there -- physically, could
you move this to a place where

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.240 align:middle line:84%
it would not obstruct
you to go here?

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.782 align:middle line:90%


00:39:40.782 --> 00:39:42.365 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I could
move it right here.

00:39:42.365 --> 00:39:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That would be the
most healthy lineup of all,

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:46.760 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So
does that still work?

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:49.652 align:middle line:90%
Just notice.

00:39:49.652 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I feel a little
anxiety around removing it

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:52.679 align:middle line:90%
entirely.

00:39:52.679 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.092 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
not to remove it.

00:39:56.092 --> 00:39:57.050 align:middle line:90%
So here's your anxiety.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.594 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:39:59.594 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER:
What's the anxiety?

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.740 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
with the anxiety?

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.281 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's almost like--
and I know a lot of people will

00:40:05.281 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:84%
relate to this-- I feel
like once my brain's going

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and I've kind of
sorted through my day,

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.830 align:middle line:84%
then I need to go just clear
email from around the world,

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:90%
just clear my email.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.510 align:middle line:84%
If I just clear it
and don't get engaged

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:84%
with lengthy answers or anything
and just check, check, flag,

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.090 align:middle line:84%
flag, that could
be a healthy way

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to do it without taking
up a lot of time.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And then just getting
right on to the rest of it

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and getting on this, so I
could maybe shorten that time.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:35.025 align:middle line:84%
So would this part be
OK with doing that?

00:40:35.025 --> 00:40:35.895 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:35.895 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: What
about the anxiety?

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.811 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It feels like
that would be all right.

00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So is there a time
limit to that?

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.499 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:44.499 --> 00:40:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: What's
the time limit?

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.215 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No more
than 30 minutes.

00:40:47.215 --> 00:40:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No more than.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So how
could you set that up that

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.409 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
sticking to that?

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Mm, I just
have to choose that,

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.120 align:middle line:90%
make that decision.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Do you
have a clock somewhere?

00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Or do you
have a clock on your computer

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:01.530 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:02.446 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I do.

00:41:02.446 --> 00:41:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And it could be less than
that too, just clear and go.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and just say, email is OK.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.409 align:middle line:90%
Don't engage in the rest of it.

00:41:08.409 --> 00:41:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
exercising, it's

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.695 align:middle line:84%
actually a good time
to plan out the day

00:41:11.695 --> 00:41:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and think about things anyway.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:17.099 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, to narrow that down
but not eliminate it I think

00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:17.890 align:middle line:90%
is a good solution.

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:18.705 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: OK.

00:41:18.705 --> 00:41:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So there you go.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: So we'll
just leave this for now?

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We'll just
leave that for now.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's much more,
but we're about out of time.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So let me just ask you one
or two more quick questions.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:84%
When you have a therapist
or a facilitator

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.051 align:middle line:84%
that is anxious or
messed up or whatever

00:41:34.051 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're working in
this field together,

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.245 align:middle line:84%
how is that going to affect
the outcome for the client?

00:41:39.245 --> 00:41:42.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER:
Very good question.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that every facilitator
who facilitates this work

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.690 align:middle line:84%
does a lot of work on
themselves before they do this.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens-- and this
happens to every therapist--

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:02.170 align:middle line:84%
that if you have not resolved
an issue, you can get triggered.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: When
somebody talks about trauma,

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:84%
talks about abuse, you can get
triggered with your own issue

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.080 align:middle line:90%
that you have not resolved.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same here.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then that
puts it into the field,

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.099 align:middle line:90%
which is damaging.

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of
like a blind spot.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: It's like you're
not actually noticing that

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.850 align:middle line:84%
there's somebody in trauma right
over here and I'm not actually

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.350 align:middle line:90%
seeing it.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's standing
there in the trauma,

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.722 align:middle line:84%
and I don't see it because
I'm not sensitive to it.

00:42:30.722 --> 00:42:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.430 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:35.950 align:middle line:90%
I think this is fun.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:38.859 align:middle line:90%
I like your family here.

00:42:38.859 --> 00:42:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Thank you.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Your
little associates.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very--

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: And
thank you for playing.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:42.886 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --visceral.

00:42:42.886 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:90%
It's very quick.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.230 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how it
is in the big grouping,

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.360 align:middle line:84%
but I know my son was
saying it was amazing,

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.430 align:middle line:84%
the breakthrough that
the woman he was watching

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.680 align:middle line:90%
had going through this.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So any final thought
before we sign off here?

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER: Well, this work
is the same as in the group

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.420 align:middle line:84%
where people are
actually talking.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:90%
The structure is the same.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.640 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
is different is really

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.430 align:middle line:90%
that these guys can't talk.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So the client has to
do more of the talking

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and has to be more actually
engaged in the process.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.616 align:middle line:84%
But the processes is the same,
and the result is the same.

00:43:16.616 --> 00:43:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It sure seems
a lot quicker than sitting

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and chatting about
something, I'll say that.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I see why you ditched
that part of your career.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>> DORNBERGER: Yes, thank you.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who needs
everybody's stories?

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.824 align:middle line:90%
We'll create our own right here.

00:43:28.824 --> 00:43:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Elmar,
for taking the time.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.406 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:43:31.406 --> 00:43:32.130 align:middle line:90%
This was fun.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER:
Thank you, Regina.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A little
free therapy too.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DORNBERGER:
Thanks for having me.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.831 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To connect
directly with Elmar's work,

00:43:37.831 --> 00:43:41.112 align:middle line:84%
you can go to his website
at hemisphereconsulting.com.

00:43:41.112 --> 00:43:43.230 align:middle line:84%
To find a facilitator
closer to you,

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:45.710 align:middle line:84%
can just google
constellation therapy

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and the name of
your city or region.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:44:14.167 align:middle line:90%
