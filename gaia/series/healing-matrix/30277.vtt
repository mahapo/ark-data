00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'm so
glad to be sitting here

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco with
you in your office.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DAN DUNPHY: Welcome.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I met you
about six months ago.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:90%
I know, it's beautiful.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:84%
This is where I'm from,
this is my home city.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.407 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Welcome back.

00:00:34.407 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The way I met
you was interesting,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.293 align:middle line:10%
because I had been receiving
emails from viewers when--

00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:10%
with Conscious
Media Network-- you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:10%
have to interview Dan Dunphy.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
He understands the body in a
way nobody else understands it.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:10%
Then another friend of mine,
who's very good at researching

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:10%
and had found you as
a personal physician,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.550 align:middle line:10%
had said, oh, you've got to--

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:10%
you've got to interview
this fellow one day.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:10%
And then later on,
she was telling me,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:10%
by the way, that
situation, I really

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:10%
think you need to go to-- so
by the time I came to you,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.332 align:middle line:10%
I hadn't connected all the dots
except your name was starting

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:09.085 align:middle line:10%
to sound very familiar, like
all roads lead to Dan Dunphy.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:09.885 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] So
here we are finally

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:10%
doing our interview.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: And so when we met,
you didn't realize I was--

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.982 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I didn't know you
were the same one that they

00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:10%
had been writing about, yes.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And-- I think I was on my way
home, I thought, Dan Dunphy,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:90%
Dan Dunphy--

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Where have I
heard that name before?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --putting it together,
did a search on my email

00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:90%
and found it.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, they were right.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:10%
Your understanding of the human
body is really just astounding,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:10%
you put it together
in such a rounded way,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.308 align:middle line:10%
and I mean that
multi-dimensionally.

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Actually in a circle.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In a circle.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.287 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where I
thought we would

00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:44.848 align:middle line:84%
begin as you treat your
clients very differently

00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
than when you walk into
a normal doctor's office.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Can you just start with the
process and hierarchy of what

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:90%
you feel as though important?

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Sure.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:10%
I think the primary thing is to
listen, and to take the time.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:10%
So I spend an hour
and a half minimum

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.815 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes two hours or more
just listening to the story.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:84%
The story is, as a writer, the
story's always interesting.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I started
writing when I was a teenager,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
but medicine became
the perfect profession

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
for someone who
likes to tell stories

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and likes to listen
to the stories.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So I do spend a lot of time
listening, and very carefully

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
asking questions of
people, including

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:84%
what time they go to bed
and what time they get up

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and when they have their first
meal and what it is they have

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:90%
and how their energy is.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And tracking all those
minutia out of that

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:90%
emerges causative factors.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.110 align:middle line:84%
We are complex
biological systems.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:10%
And when someone comes in
and says, my elbow hurts,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:10%
there's usually
a lot more to it.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:10%
Or my heart hurts.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:10%
And at various levels when you
start listening to the story

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:10%
and you put together
the symptoms, then

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:10%
you start finding causation in
terms of emotional well-being.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And primarily, from
first breath to last,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:90%
stress is part of life.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So for years I
talk to my patients

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:90%
about glycemic balance.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.848 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And when I worked
with Robert Atkins in New York,

00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
we did glucose tolerance tests
with insulin levels on everyone

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:90%
came in.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:10%
So without doing
that much anymore,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:10%
I can pretty much determine if
glycemic imbalance is present.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:10%
And if it is, it's
a perfect entrance

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:10%
into decompressing stress.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So whatever type
of stress we have,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
be it emotional situational
stress or pain, inflammation,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
trauma, allergy, or glycemic
imbalance-- too, high too low,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
the body interprets
that in cortisol.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol is the stress
hormone, and it's the currency

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:90%
of stress in the body.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It's how stress is interpreted
and it's a hormone.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And cortisol has a potential
negative impact relationship

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:90%
with every system in the body.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And if I-- you can see perhaps
the mandala, which is a circle,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
mandala is cortisol.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Because from first
breath until last,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:90%
stress is inherent in life.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a tension between
chaos and organization,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
between life and death,
between healing--

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It manages
your body's responses.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: It's the
office manager of stress.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why
it's in the center.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And every system can
potentially interact with it.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we come in and
things are not going right

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:84%
in our life, and
it could be cancer,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
it could be a heart attack,
it could be irritable bowel,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
it could be hormonal
imbalance, cortisol is always

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
interacting with those symptoms
and with those systems.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And just like you take
one molecule of water--

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
it kind of looks like
Mickey Mouse, H2O--

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and you could know everything
there was to know about it,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
but you could not predict what
would happen when you put 10

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to the 10 billion
of them together,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly you have fluidity.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:90%
You have emergent phenomena.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
You have life itself
emerging out of the sea.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You have the ocean,
you have hurricanes,

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
you have cloud forms,
you have weather fronts.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So the emergent phenomenon are
ultimately not predictable.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:10%
There's a predictability
to it, but you can't

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:10%
put your finger on it unless--

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:10%
sometimes we can if
we're really good--

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:10%


00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:10%
or intuitive, usually.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.065 align:middle line:10%
The way that animals can
pick up on an earthquake--

00:06:23.065 --> 00:06:23.865 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:23.865 --> 00:06:25.105 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: --way ahead of us.

00:06:25.105 --> 00:06:26.063 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:06:26.063 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Just what
level you tuned in.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But those emergent phenomenon
are symptoms, they are disease.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:10%
And the soil out of
which those emerge,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:10%
the complexity and the complex
system is the body itself.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So the body's a
complex system composed

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
of complex systems interacting,
and the ground soil

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:90%
in the center is stress--

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:84%
cortisol-- interacting
with different systems.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
In one person, the
stress may show up

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
as a heart attack; as
another with ovarian cysts;

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:90%
in another, both.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Insomnia, whatever.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear the
story and the symptoms,

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
there is the leaky boat
and the storm at sea.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
The leaky boat is
the symptomatology,

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
the physical ailments, the
systems which are disrupted,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
flooding the body, and the storm
at sea is a physiologic storm.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So if someone has a bunch
of stress in their life

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.937 align:middle line:84%
and they have inflammation,
and on top of that,

00:07:39.937 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
their blood sugar's
all over the place

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
because they're eating simple
sugars, refined carbohydrates,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
they're not eating
right, they're getting up

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, they're
sleeping six hours,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
maybe, not refreshed, don't
eat anything, have some coffee,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
crash in the afternoon, and then
are wide awake at 11 o'clock,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
because their life pattern is
supporting the dysfunction.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:10%
And so the storm at sea,
the physiologic storm,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:10%
if we can calm it down,
simply that the easiest

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:10%
stress to eliminate,
the easiest thing

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:24.190 align:middle line:10%
to reduce cortisol many times
is in diet and nutrition

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:10%
so that we're grounded.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.293 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's
really getting down

00:08:29.293 --> 00:08:31.759 align:middle line:10%
to the most basic level, right?

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking about
all of these emergent effects

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
fuel we put into our mouths.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Exactly.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
really is precipitating

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.162 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the effect
that trickles outward.

00:08:45.162 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: And it may not be
the cause of everything--

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:10%
many times it's
not, but if someone

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.020 align:middle line:10%
comes in with a very
complex set of conditions--

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:10%
so the boat has a
lot of leaks in it.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And medicine has given
them a nice, big, expensive

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
gold-plated bucket to bail
with, and that's basically

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:90%
a lot of medicine.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It's symptomatic, it
doesn't address the holes,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't address
the physiologic storm,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
but it gives you a really nice
expensive bucket to bail with,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're keeping
your head above water.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:10%
But among the three
types of stress--

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:10%
situational stress and pain,
inflammation, trauma, injury,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:10%
allergy, and then glycemic
imbalance, blood sugar

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:10%
imbalance, blood sugar
is the easiest and most

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:10%
rapid way to remove one
of the stress vectors

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:10%
and lower the cortisol demand.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And once you lower
the cortisol demand,

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and the physiologic
storm settles down,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and people will come back in
a week or two weeks or three

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
weeks and say, it's
not all better,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:84%
but I'm starting to sleep,
and I have a little less pain.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And I just seem to be able
to cope with things better

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:90%
even though nothing's changed.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now this
is predominantly

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:90%
dietary at this point, the fix?

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:02.757 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: It's--

00:10:02.757 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With the
glycemic imbalance?

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: --glycemic imbalance,
addressing glycemic imbalance.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:84%
If you can sleep, you can
heal; if you're grounded,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:90%
you can connect--

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:84%
your intuition can connect,
your brain can connect.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And the main reason why
not eating or eating

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
the wrong things causes
stress is not always apparent

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
to people, but there's
one evolutionary fact--

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
the brain, the nervous
system, cognition, emotions,

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:84%
heart rate,
digestion, everything

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:90%
is connected with the fact--

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:84%
the whole nervous system
cannot make or store glucose.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:90%
So when the brain--

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:90%
when blood sugar drops--

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:84%
so you eat some sugar,
blood sugar goes up,

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
insulin tracks it,
blood sugar drops,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and some people
over-respond with insulin,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
so their blood
sugar drops rapidly.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And they get all these--

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
they get cognitive,
emotional, want

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:90%
to suck their thumb in a corner.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Palpitations.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Panicky.

00:11:09.855 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: That's because
the brain is saying,

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:84%
burn the furniture,
there's no fuel.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: And it
cannot support itself.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:10%
So the cortisol's
secreted, and cortisol

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:10%
tells the liver and the
muscles and joints and tendon,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:10%
release your stored energy,
we're on zero fuel emergency

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Aren't
there people, though,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:90%
that live like this every day?

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.713 align:middle line:90%
That go into this every day?

00:11:33.713 --> 00:11:35.755 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Some people are
totally addicted to it.

00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:36.797 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Addicted to it.

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:37.605 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:37.605 --> 00:11:38.973 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Whoo!

00:11:38.973 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I think
most people watching

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:90%
this can probably relate.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
They know when they have the big
drop where it's like, anything,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:90%
get me to a mocha fast.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: There's no
coincidence that most arguments

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.980 align:middle line:90%
occur before dinner.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Statistically.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.625 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: And if you had kids,
you've seen the melt down.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.425 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: What we used
to call the arsenic hour.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Arrgh!

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's because
their blood sugar's down.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: You feed
them and then they're

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.055 align:middle line:84%
purring like little
kittens after the meal.

00:12:08.055 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And this--
so after working

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
with Robert Atkins
for 10 years or so

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and helping him start one of
the first holistic practices

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
in the country, I really
had that nailed down.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.525 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could see
it, I could feel it

00:12:25.525 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:90%
when someone would come in.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So I do spend a lot of
time in that realm reducing

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:90%
the physiologic storm at sea.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And then when things
calm down, you

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
can begin to identify
where the holes are,

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
because what's left
residually is probably

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
an organic or physical
impediment to healing.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before, you're in this
storm, and all you could do

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:90%
is bail the boat.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So that is
methodology for everyone

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:90%
to incorporate into their life.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me
ask you about that.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, because you're talking
about this whole glycemic ride.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.390 align:middle line:84%
This is-- everybody
deals with this at one--

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
most people deal with it
at some time or another.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Now as we're talking
about it, I'm also aware,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
there's every kind of diet and
guru under the sun out there.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, raw foods only, only fruits
and vegetables, only proteins

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and fats, only complex
carbohydrates and proteins,

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and paleo, beyond paleo,
raw, and everything else.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: South
Beach, North Beach.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.427 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: North Beach.

00:13:29.427 --> 00:13:31.260 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Or just spaghetti
and pasta, right?

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.060 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Jamaica.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At least
in San Francisco.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you
begin addressing that?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I know each one of
us is wired very differently.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just looking at
metabolic typing alone,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:84%
somebody is going to
be feeling grounded

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
on more carbohydrates
where the other needs

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:90%
a lot of protein and fats.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Is that something you can--

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:90%
you evaluated in that first bit?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have a recommendation
for people, a little self-test

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
to go to to see which
types they fall into.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Once people--
if I put them on--

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:10%
first of all, take them
off the jet fuel rapidly--

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Caffeine, sugar,
white flour, all that stuff?

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Because the
glycemic index of foods

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
fuels insulin resistance,
abdominal fat, and debilitation

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:90%
of the adrenals and thyroid.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.837 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Because cortisol
is beginning to interfere

00:14:25.837 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:90%
with their function.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to go into
all the details, but it happens.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:36.168 align:middle line:84%
That the body's holographic,
and it's also self-healing.

00:14:36.168 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of diet, I want
to get people to a position

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
where they listen to
their body and they know

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:90%
what makes them feel better.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And when someone
says, well here's

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:84%
some guidelines-- here you
are, here's your guidelines,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
try this out and let's
see how you feel.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.363 align:middle line:84%
And checking in with your body,
checking in with yourself--

00:15:00.363 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
are you getting nervous
at the end of the day?

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Are you crashing?

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Are you sleeping well?

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Well these are the indications,
these are the road signs.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times it's
about listening to our body.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
You're on a Rocky Mountain
highway going 80 miles an hour

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
around the curves, and
there's a road sign

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that says, go slow,
dangerous curves.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So you throw a blanket over
it and step on the gas,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:90%
and that's a lot of medicine.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Just don't pay attention
to that road sign that

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
says slow down, eat better, pay
attention, you're not sleeping.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.710 align:middle line:90%
So you go off the cliff.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And that's
what we call disease,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
as though it came
out of nowhere.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, it came because
you didn't slow down

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't listen,
you didn't pay attention.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not
really for anyone else.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
That is more to
your own intuition.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
You know when you eat
something, if it makes

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
you feel sleepy or skitzy
or anything else, that's

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.380 align:middle line:90%
not good for you.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.505 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: I think it's good
to take in information.

00:16:06.505 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:90%
There are attempts to type--

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:90%
to do metabolic typing.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I find them all inadequate,
because the body is so complex,

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
that you take a little bit of
this and a little bit of that,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and every person who comes
in is a little different.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And so I really
believe in some of the broad

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
concepts--

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
not skipping meals.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But some people can skip
meals all their life

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't bother them.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: So how does it fit?

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense,

00:16:40.855 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
because I've done the metabolic
typing, little self-tests

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and all that, and
it would appear

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
to be that I am a fast
oxidizer, I need a lot of fat

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and proteins, which is
generally the case, then

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe a few days
out, just want carbs

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
for the day and nothing else
and feel great, and then go back

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:90%
to it the next day.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is how a
lot of people are.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
How do you address that
kind of-- if it's not

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:84%
a totally lopsided
out-of-balance craving,

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
a natural kind of inclination
that's different from what

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.704 align:middle line:90%
you were doing the day before?

00:17:09.704 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Mm-hmm.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:10%
I watch the energy
levels during the day,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:10%
and it's not just
about diet either.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the interface
between nutrition and health

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:90%
is the gastrointestinal system.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:84%
We have in our body 100 trillion
bacteria and 10 trillion cells.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So the bacteria on our
skin and the bacteria that

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:84%
run through the GI
system literally

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
are another organ
in the human body.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's been studied now--
it's called the microbiota,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:90%
and it's a genome.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: They're not
counting bacteria,

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
they're looking at the
genetics of the microbiota that

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:90%
inhabit the gut.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that it's inherited.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:10%
And in the same way that a child
cycles from its mother's breast

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:10%
and gets the benign bacteria,
our food influences what grows,

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:10%
and the ecosystem
in the gut is such

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:10%
that when there's
inflammation due to gastritis,

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:10%
due to worries-- some
people somatize their stress

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.660 align:middle line:10%
in their stomach and literally
have their gut feelings ripping

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:10%
them apart.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Holding
in emotion or being

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:10%
subjected to a lot of
negativity by other people.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And empathic people are
much more prone to that

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:90%
and susceptible.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But inflammation in the
gut, gluten sensitivity,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
antibiotics, the microbiota
that grow influence inflammation

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:90%
in the lining of the gut.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:84%
The lining of the gut is
simple columnar epithelium

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
that's lined up and connected
with connective tissue,

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:27.195 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system is
built in to the lining.

00:19:27.195 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The sinuses, the mouth, the
gut, the respiratory tract,

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:84%
the GI tract, reproductive
tract are all the same thing.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:84%
They have at embryonic
level embedded lymphocytes

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:90%
from birth.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the secretion of
what's called secretory IgA

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
modulates with antibodies
what grows in the gut.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, if there
is inflammation,

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a breaking
apart of that integrity.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The barrier between
the outside world

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
that runs through us and inside
world in the blood is broken.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.772 align:middle line:84%
And so we get undigested food
leaking into the bloodstream.

00:20:07.772 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.365 align:middle line:90%
That's where the dietetic--

00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: That's leaky gut.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.203 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Leaky gut.

00:20:12.203 --> 00:20:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the dietary
influences and allergies

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:84%
such as gluten and
such really start

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.218 align:middle line:84%
playing havoc is they
create this inflammation

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:90%
cycle you're speaking of.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: They also great
the allergy to be in there.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Aside
from celiac, which

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.220 align:middle line:10%
is an inherited gluten
sensitivity, that's

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:10%
a needle in a haystack.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: The Haystack is
acquired gluten sensitivity.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah--

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: For many reasons.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For many people.

00:20:34.303 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: But-- so that
inflammatory cycle,

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
the cytokines, which are
inflammatory proteins secreted

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:90%
by the lining--

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
the cells that line
the gut, influence

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
what grows in the gut, and what
grows in the gut influences

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:90%
inflammation.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So you get this reverb chamber
of inflammatory response,

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.882 align:middle line:84%
and just bombing bugs
will not make it better.

00:21:01.882 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bombing bugs?

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I have Candida, I have
Lyme, I have Epstein-Barr.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:84%
You can't bomb your way
out of these problems.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you say
bomb, you mean just like--

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Antibiotics.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Throw a bunch
of antibiotics at them.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: I mean, there are
times and appropriate uses

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:84%
for these very
powerful medications,

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
but what you're
left with after you

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:84%
take a course of antibiotics for
whatever is an ecosystem which

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
is disrupted and leaky, and
inflammation which persists,

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and the allergic reaction causes
more cortisol to be released,

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and cortisol suppresses
the immune system.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a cycle
that just defeats

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:90%
the entire system, doesn't it?

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Once you start it.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, what-- OK, so--

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.245 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So diet-- but I
always pay close attention

00:21:56.245 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes do a
comprehensive stool analysis--

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: --for
patients, because I want

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:90%
to know what the interface is.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:84%
What's growing,
what's not growing,

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
enzymes, immune function,
allergic sensitivity

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:90%
from the inside-out.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And that helps us determine
what, well OK, what

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:90%
is the right diet?

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I'm not
going to give you

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
any supplements except
enzymes, probiotics,

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:90%
and some kind of glutamate base.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Glutamate is an
amino acid which is

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:84%
essential for regrowing
the lining of the gut--

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
for regrowing that
connective interface that

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:84%
creates a barrier between
the inside and outside world.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: While we're
still in this area,

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.710 align:middle line:84%
what are the
implications of having

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:84%
leaky gut after these systems
have blown apart, so to speak?

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Malabsorption.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Malabsorption
of nutrients, OK.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: And inflammation
leading to immune suppression.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So you could
have autoimmune disorders

00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.770 align:middle line:10%
as a result.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.270 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Well
actually, this is how

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:10%
autoimmune disease generates.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Is through leaky gut.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah, because
there is inherited tendency

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:10%
for autoimmune illness.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:90%
There are environmental factors.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:90%
There's diet.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:90%
There's overmedication.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you put
them all together,

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:84%
you find that until you address
this longstanding issue,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
the immune system is going
to continue to misfire,

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:84%
because you're nailing
the immune system 24/7

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:90%
and every time you eat.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:84%
When the undigested food is
leaking into the immune system,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
into the blood, and the
immune system is triggering

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
what are called
immune complexes,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
immune complexes go to the
liver or attack the gut,

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and the autoimmune reaction has
to do with the immune system

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
getting overwhelmed
and getting locked

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
into an inflammatory cycle, just
like a tire stuck in the snow.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's repeating the
same inflammatory response.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So you break the
inflammatory response,

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and you nourish the ecosystem,
and you increase absorption,

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
the joints don't hurt,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're not getting
cold and flu as much,

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're sleeping better, and
things start turning around.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
That's a slow process,
it can be a slow process,

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:40.237 align:middle line:84%
but it's not like when
someone comes in and says,

00:24:40.237 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I have an earache, I'm going to
go through all this with them.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: I address the earache.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.067 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: But then there
might be a lot behind that,

00:24:47.067 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:10%
because when people get
tonsillitis or they get sinus

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.077 align:middle line:10%
infections--

00:24:51.077 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Same thing as the gut.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.743 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: --the gut's involved--
but the gut's involved.

00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
percentage of people

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
that walk through your
door end up benefiting

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
from some of the things
you just mentioned?

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Enzyme, systemic and digestive.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Mm-hmm.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And from probiotics
and from L-glutatmine,

00:25:07.475 --> 00:25:08.302 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:25:08.302 --> 00:25:10.385 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are the three
things you mentioned--

00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:11.185 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Most.

00:25:11.185 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Most people.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Is it fair to say that you're
over 30 or 40 years old

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and you live in America or
you have a Western diet going

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.490 align:middle line:84%
in general, even a good
one, that you could

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.630 align:middle line:90%
benefit from those things?

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for a
little takeaway here.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: I think elemental
healing emerges out

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:84%
of traditional
cultures, and that's

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:84%
the use of earth, water,
fire, and minerals in plants.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So elemental healing is
using the elements of earth

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:84%
to cleanse, and
traditional cultures also

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:84%
have times of fast
and times of famine.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.107 align:middle line:84%
Our culture has times
of consumption and times

00:25:55.107 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:90%
of more consumption.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.107 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's right.

00:25:57.107 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So pulling back in
the fall and in the spring

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and doing a bit of fasting or
juicing or colon cleansing--

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
in Christian culture
there's lent,

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:84%
which is the time of
fasting, and Ramadan,

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and they exist in all
traditional cultures.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And following that
seasonal adjustment

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and getting in touch with your
body and what's right about it

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and what's wrong, just listening
is critically important,

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:90%
I think, and simple.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be complicated.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
You can take sauna baths,
you can bathe in a bathtub,

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.720 align:middle line:84%
you can do some juicing,
you can do a vegetarian diet

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit, just kind of
let your intestines clean out.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You can use soy and bentonite
or flax seed and water

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.070 align:middle line:90%
and take some probiotics.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:10%
And I think the
important thing is

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:10%
to address these
things before you

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:10%
have such a buildup of toxicity
that a single footstep creates

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:10%
an avalanche.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.430 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: And I have people
come in like that and I tiptoe,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:10%
because first of
all, the bad side

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:10%
effects-- the headaches,
stomach ache, the fever, even,

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.500 align:middle line:10%
are not always bad things.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a sign of the body
trying to correct itself.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And so I think
it's really important

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to listen to that and
to allow it to happen.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And when people are
fearful of that happening,

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:90%
they're generally holding on.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:84%
It's happening at that
emotional level, too.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: But I wanted to
also say that in this mandala

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:84%
with cortisol in the
center and the hormone

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
system and the
brain biochemistry

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system and
the cardiovascular system

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and the gut and all these
various things interconnected,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
that it's not just
about what it is

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and where it is, it's also about
having the vitality to mount

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.150 align:middle line:90%
a healing response.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And that is where we
can talk about three sections

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:90%
of the mandala.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.100 align:middle line:84%
The adrenals are
your starter motor.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: The thyroid is
your voltage regulator,

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:10%
how much energy
you're expanding.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.005 align:middle line:10%
And methylation, which no one
knows about, is the generator.

00:28:37.005 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
just a little break just

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of minutes,
and we'll come back

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and I really want to
hear about methylation,

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.272 align:middle line:84%
because until I met you, I had
never heard of the subject.

00:28:47.272 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just--

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Auto mechanics
and body mechanics.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.610 align:middle line:10%
OK, we're back, and we're going
to talk about methylation,

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:10%
which you've likely never heard
of, nor had I ever heard of.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:10%
So let's begin.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Well, as you can
see on the screen right now,

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
there's methylation chart,
and it looks like a uroboros.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a yin-yang signal.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
is a yellow stripe--

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.920 align:middle line:84%
so there's a red
and a blue yin-yang,

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
yellow in the middle.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:10%
And the yellow is a
handle on the generator.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:10%
So this is all about the
movement of electrons,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:10%
and it occurs in the liver.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:10%
So methylation is
primarily something

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:10%
the liver accomplishes.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:10%
And methylation is like
a socket of electrons.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So methionine contains carbon
and 3-hydrogen molecule,

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and that has
electrons in it, OK?

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And B12-- the handle
on the generator,

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:84%
the thing cranking it is B12,
B6, folic acid, and magnesium.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So taking those things tends to
help the body generate energy.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is often
a problem when one becomes

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.313 align:middle line:84%
a vegan or
vegetarian, is often--

00:30:08.313 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: It could be.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's-- yes.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people--

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:10%
I know myself included--

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.920 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: And there
are genetics involved.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.295 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: There
are genetics, OK.

00:30:14.295 --> 00:30:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: People have so-called
SNPs of genes, either double

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.660 align:middle line:84%
or single SNPs depending on
whether they have one or two

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.900 align:middle line:90%
parents with a problem.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And they say,
well, I'm a slow metabolizer,

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.260 align:middle line:90%
or I can't detoxify.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: That is
connected with methylation.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the methionine
with a carbon

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
3-hydrogen group in the
presence of the B12, B6, folic,

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:90%
magnesium creates SAMe.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: S-A-M-e.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And SAMe is a
18-wheeler carrying electrons.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And it distributes
all over the body--

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:90%
this is the socket.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It moves electrons, gives
the cells energy to make

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:90%
ATP, the energy molecule.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And ATP
allows methylation,

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and methylation allows ATP,
it's a Celtic knot pattern.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything is interconnected
this way in the body.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
It also gives electrons in the
brain for neurotransmitter,

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's why
people take SAMe--

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.440 align:middle line:84%
you may recognize
that as something you

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:90%
take for depression, perhaps.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a socket,
it's an electron flow

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.600 align:middle line:84%
for helping the brain make
more neurotransmitters,

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.930 align:middle line:90%
and it's involved with detox.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Then SAMe-- turns it
loses its electrons,

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
it has a positive charge,
it's a free radical

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:90%
called homocysteine.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And some people
may recognize this

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:84%
from their cardiologist
ordering a homocysteine level,

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:84%
because when it's high,
it's a cardiovascular risk.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:90%
It's an inflammatory molecule.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.510 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: On the
methylation cycle--

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:58.427 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: On the
methylation cycle

00:31:58.427 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:10%
it's at the bottom
with no electrons.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:10%
So we started here,
and we cranked around,

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:10%
we distributed electrons.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.980 align:middle line:10%
Now we have this
free radical, it's

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:10%
supposed to be re-methylated.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.050 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a cycle, and
that's why it's in a circle.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.383 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So now it's down here.

00:32:12.383 --> 00:32:14.275 align:middle line:84%
Does it get stuck in
this homocysteine--

00:32:14.275 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: When it
piles up on the desk,

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.080 align:middle line:84%
it means you're not
methylating either,

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have enough
trimethylglycine or some form

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:84%
of methyl group that can be
found in cabbage and sauerkraut

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
foods, methionine

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:84%
is a sulfur-containing
amino acid, so it's common.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:84%
That and lecithin has
choline, has a methyl group.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY:
Trimethylglycine is also

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.120 align:middle line:90%
known as betaine hydrochloride.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.295 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So people take that
for helping with digestion.

00:32:45.295 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you were tanked
out on those things.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: If you are
a poor methylater,

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:10%
you may not be able to
resource the methionine.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.210 align:middle line:84%
You may be low in
B12, B6, and folic.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: And homocysteine
will build up--

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:10%
so it's not just homocysteine,
it's a whole cycle that's

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.850 align:middle line:10%
not working right.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's a side
pathway for homocysteine

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to become reduced and
turn into glutathione.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
all doctors know about,

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:84%
but no one ever thinks
about after medical school.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What does that mean?

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Glutathione is
the premier antioxidant

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:34.580 align:middle line:10%
used in all cells to protect the
cell from cancer, to detoxify,

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:10%
to quench free
radicals generated

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:10%
from oxygen metabolism.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.840 align:middle line:84%
The biggest free radical
generator in the body

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:51.320 align:middle line:84%
happens in what's called
the mitochondria, which

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.030 align:middle line:90%
is the energy factory.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So most of the free radicals
coming out of the cell

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:01.600 align:middle line:84%
are due to the cell
cranking molecules of ATP,

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and in the process,
creating a lot of waste.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And glutathione is responsible
for detoxifying the cell,

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:84%
and is responsible in the
liver for detoxifying estrogen

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:84%
and testosterone, and it's
responsible in the liver

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:84%
for detoxifying heavy
metals, pesticides.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So when people can't tolerate
them, they're not methylating.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
said that there is

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:84%
a path from the homocysteines
over into the glutathione.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: As a side path.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As a side path.

00:34:33.162 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:36.929 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is happening
if that's not happening

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:39.725 align:middle line:84%
and how can you kick start
the body to take that path?

00:34:39.725 --> 00:34:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: It's interesting.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:10%
Remember I was saying that
it's not just about what it is

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.699 align:middle line:10%
or where it is, but
it's about having

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:50.840 align:middle line:10%
the vitality to go upstream
the way a salmon jumps.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: To go from
one energetic level--

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:10%
here you are to begin with, and
then normal stress, and then

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:10%
an acute situation, and
then back to normal,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:10%
and an acute situation, and
then a chronic situation.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.180 align:middle line:10%
Chronic degenerative,
tumor generative.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So each level of
degeneration means

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.710 align:middle line:84%
that the body is going
through a diminished energy.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the headlamps
on an old Volkswagen,

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:84%
you step on the gas, it
goes up, you use the brake,

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.383 align:middle line:90%
and you get dim.

00:35:22.383 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough
vitality, there's not

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.780 align:middle line:90%
enough generation of vitality.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And inflammation and
stress diminish adrenals,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:84%
block thyroid, and
interfere with methylation.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And you need your starter
motor, voltage regulator,

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and generator to mount
that healing response.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:49.393 align:middle line:84%
So it's listening, it's
diet, it's making sure

00:35:49.393 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:84%
that if you're going to
take a nutritional approach,

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.690 align:middle line:90%
you digest well.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's also paying
attention to the energizing

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.490 align:middle line:84%
organs of the body-- the
liver and the adrenals

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:90%
and the thyroid.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
cortisol interferes

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:84%
with their function--
first of all, cortisol

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.290 align:middle line:90%
is produced in the adrenals.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So the more cortisol
demand you have,

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the harder the adrenals have
to work and they get tired.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
seems to be a common--

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.905 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
books written on it--

00:36:20.905 --> 00:36:22.197 align:middle line:90%
"21st Century Adrenal Fatigue."

00:36:22.197 --> 00:36:22.997 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:36:22.997 --> 00:36:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems like half
the population has that.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And so-- and because
the adrenals and the thyroid

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.570 align:middle line:84%
are paired, really,
when one is diminished,

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.320 align:middle line:84%
the other tries to
take up the slack,

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and so then you get
both being diminished.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but you can
have completely normal thyroid

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.510 align:middle line:90%
levels in blood.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And with a high cortisol
demand, the cortisol,

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:84%
being a survival hormone,
tends to shut down

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:84%
the permeability
of cell membranes

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.250 align:middle line:90%
to the uptake of thyroid.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now why
does it do that in a--

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.930 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: It shuts
the cell down.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.990 align:middle line:10%
It's a lockdown, emergency.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:04.328 align:middle line:10%
So the--

00:37:04.328 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Why would the body
do that for your survival?

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Why would it shut the cells
down for your survival?

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.900 align:middle line:84%
What is it trying
to protect against?

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: It's-- when you're
stressed, you tighten up.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Here's the
normal physiologic reaction

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:21.966 align:middle line:90%
to cortisol.

00:37:21.966 --> 00:37:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: It happens in mice,
it happens in humans, it

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.705 align:middle line:90%
happens in all mammals.

00:37:26.705 --> 00:37:27.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so the cell--

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.375 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: So everything
tightens up--

00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:31.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --it happens
at the cellular level.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And we know that cortisol
causes insulin resistance,

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.460 align:middle line:84%
it increases insulin
resistance, making

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.050 align:middle line:84%
your pancreas have
to work harder

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.050 align:middle line:90%
to do the same amount of work.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So the more stress--

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Causing more
glycemic imbalance.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.283 align:middle line:84%
So it's all this
negative feedback loop.

00:37:45.283 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And so you can
have normal thyroid levels

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and still be losing
hair and have

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:84%
cold extremities
and brittle nails.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So functionality--
what's normal is not optimal,

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and what's on a
blood test is not

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:09.030 align:middle line:84%
exactly indicative of
how someone may feel.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Because the
blood tests in medicine,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.550 align:middle line:84%
appropriately, are aimed at
the part of the iceberg that's

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.050 align:middle line:90%
above the water.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look upon an iceberg,
you see two-thirds of it

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
is underwater, the sea level
is where things emerge out of.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And the part of the
iceberg that's above water you

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:30.590 align:middle line:90%
can see.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.060 align:middle line:84%
That would be the purview
of Western medicine.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: That's disease.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And the tip of the
iceberg is acute care.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: We need that.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you break your
arm, going to go to an ER.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: If you're
in an auto accident.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's where Western
medical model excels.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:84%
It's anatomical-- to a
certain degree, physiologic.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But the things leading
to the tip and the things

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:59.390 align:middle line:84%
leading away from
it are not even

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
in the purview of medicine,
those are below the water line.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.610 align:middle line:84%
The water line is
chronic illness.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And Western
medicine does a pretty bad job

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:90%
of managing it.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: It's
antibiotics or steroids,

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:16.340 align:middle line:84%
or antibiotics or steroids,
or antibiotics and steroids.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: I mean-- and
it's not to belittle,

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.410 align:middle line:84%
it's just that the model
for understanding it

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:84%
is not taught in
medical schools.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: The complexity
and the interactivity

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and the holographic nature
and the fractal emergent

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
nature of the human body is
not appreciated in medicine.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.190 align:middle line:90%
We have a Cartesian--

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.680 align:middle line:84%
divide everything up and
put all the information

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.910 align:middle line:84%
in little boxes and a
mechanistic physics.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:50.480 align:middle line:84%
We use quantum
mechanics and CT scans,

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and we use mechanistic,
Cartesian, divide-and-conquer

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.230 align:middle line:90%
logic in clinical practice.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's not biological.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.750 align:middle line:84%
That is not what
biology is about.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Biology is about
complexity and emergent--

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: To paraphrase,
shit happens.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.692 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: It's just like,
whoa, where'd that come from?

00:40:13.692 --> 00:40:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And so just to
appreciate that context

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:24.200 align:middle line:84%
is to understand that it's not
just about where things are

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and what they are,
but also do we

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.522 align:middle line:84%
have the vitality to
mount a healing response--

00:40:30.522 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that gets
us back to the question

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I asked about this movement
over from the homocysteines

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:90%
into the glutathione response.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So the answer
to that is it takes energy

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.720 align:middle line:90%
to create energy.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.720 align:middle line:90%
And in order to--

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:55.880 align:middle line:84%
in chemistry, when a molecule
gets an electron, it's reduced,

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and when it gives up its
electron, it's oxidized.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So the paint job in an
old Chevy is oxidized.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.495 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: It's faded.

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:06.080 align:middle line:90%
It lacks vitality.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And so oxidation is a
lack of electron vitality.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You take homocysteine
and it's a faded Chevy,

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.375 align:middle line:90%
and it's hungry for electrons.

00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So it tends
to damage heart cells,

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:84%
it tends to damage the
lining of the arteries.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a free--
so-called free radical.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:33.620 align:middle line:84%
If it's given an
electron by SAMe,

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.730 align:middle line:84%
then it will become
cysteine, which

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:40.760 align:middle line:84%
is neutral, combined
with selenium

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:90%
and become glutathione.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And that process happens
in every red blood

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.020 align:middle line:90%
cell in our body.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It happens in every
vital cell in our body.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:84%
In the mitochondria, ATP
is giving us the energy

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:84%
to reduce glutathione,
to recycle glutathione,

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and glutathione gives up its
electrons to neutralize toxins,

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're eliminated
from the cell,

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing
is interactive.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Everything is interactive.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:90%
You need energy to get energy.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:90%
You have to give to get.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's say
you're in a state where

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.480 align:middle line:90%
you don't have a lot of energy.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe quite a few people--
quite a large percentage

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.700 align:middle line:84%
of people watching this may have
found themselves in that state.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.500 align:middle line:84%
You've lost your
energy, you may be

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:84%
slipping into a lot of chronic
inflammation maybe even

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.180 align:middle line:84%
throughout the body, maybe
even your digestive system is

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.880 align:middle line:84%
shutting down, maybe even
the elimination system.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.145 align:middle line:10%
I hear all the time in people
that do-- they exercise,

00:42:41.145 --> 00:42:43.520 align:middle line:10%
they're out on the trail in
the morning, they're running,

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.603 align:middle line:10%
they're doing all these
things to help themselves,

00:42:45.603 --> 00:42:50.420 align:middle line:10%
but can't digest and
eliminate from their bodies.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.540 align:middle line:90%


00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.340 align:middle line:10%
I know that--

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: You know--

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.998 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --it's
a broad question--

00:42:56.998 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: --in New York--

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.350 align:middle line:10%
when I was in New
York, I was amazed

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:05.010 align:middle line:10%
to see people walking down
the street eating pizza.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:84%
We have what's called an
autonomic nervous system.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And you have the fight/flight
sympathetic nervous system,

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and the digestion internal
milieu nervous system

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:90%
called the parasympathetic.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So walking down
the street eating

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:90%
is inherently contradictory.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes it is.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it is?

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I can't stand up
and eat, it feels horrible.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.480 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: It's not the same
as rubbing your stomach

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.280 align:middle line:10%
and patting your head, but
it's kind of similar to that.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So a lot
of times what we're

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:84%
telling the body is to do
too many things at once.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So we're not
taking the time out.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the brake shoe
for the sympathetic system

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:53.860 align:middle line:90%
is magnesium.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:84%
The accelerator of the
parasympathetic system

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.740 align:middle line:90%
is magnesium.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And so you have--

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.120 align:middle line:84%
when people have
sluggish bowels,

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.765 align:middle line:90%
I give them magnesium citrate.

00:44:09.765 --> 00:44:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like Calm,
the product Calm--

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:13.473 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Natural Calm,
yeah, something like that.

00:44:13.473 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:84%
The Romans used magnesium
citrate as a sedative,

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and it calms the brain, and it's
a brake shoe on the adrenals.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Side when we're stressed,
we use up magnesium.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:28.430 align:middle line:84%
If we use it magnesium,
we don't have peristalsis.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So getting
uptight and getting

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:90%
constipated go together.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:37.600 align:middle line:84%
There are those who are born
and even genetically predisposed

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:84%
to be on
pedal-to-the-metal mode.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's really fascinating
and complex, because one time--

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you a
personal story, I

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:84%
have a friend who is
a psychologist who

00:44:55.870 --> 00:45:00.070 align:middle line:84%
has studied for the last 30
years prenatal psychology.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:04.180 align:middle line:84%
The milieu for the fetus,
for the developing fetus

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.160 align:middle line:90%
in birth trauma.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Danny, can you come
over and talk about cortisol

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:90%
to my class?

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to have
a weekend on birth trauma.

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I said sure.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And so then at a certain
point, he said, all right,

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I want you to get a
partner, and you're

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.940 align:middle line:84%
going to pretend to rebirth,
and closed all the curtains

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and he turned on this
music and everything.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:30.940 align:middle line:10%
And everybody's like,
you'd have to push

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.180 align:middle line:10%
through the legs of your
partner in this kind of pseudo

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.100 align:middle line:10%
rebirthing.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was there, and I
said, oh my God, I really

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:41.166 align:middle line:90%
have to do this.

00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:42.165 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:42.165 --> 00:45:44.080 align:middle line:90%
So I-- OK, I'll do it.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So I laid there for a while,
and I felt a little short

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.400 align:middle line:90%
of breath.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.400 align:middle line:90%
And then I finally--

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I pushed through, and--
the legs of my partner,

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and then Wayne came by
and he put his fingers--

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and he'd known I'd been
a forceps delivery.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.920 align:middle line:84%
He put his fingers
here and here,

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and he claims that he was
only pushing a little bit,

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.300 align:middle line:84%
but I went into
the extreme shock

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and never felt so much
pain in all my life.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but I was frozen.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't-- finally I pushed
his hand away, and he said,

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:24.430 align:middle line:84%
well, you finally pushed
your hand away, and I said,

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I really feel like punching
you in the face right now.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Why did you hurt me?

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, why don't
you go take a walk on the beach.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And but what I realized is
that my body was holding on

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.170 align:middle line:84%
to a shock trauma
that I experienced

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and unconsciously
held for decades.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So the emotional
biochemistry of our mother

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.770 align:middle line:84%
influences how our
thermostat is set

00:46:56.770 --> 00:47:00.054 align:middle line:84%
in terms of sympathetic
and parasympathetic.

00:47:00.054 --> 00:47:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.838 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And if we had
a very stressed mother,

00:47:02.838 --> 00:47:05.500 align:middle line:84%
if we weren't wanted, if
there was family stress,

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:10.120 align:middle line:84%
if there was marital tension, if
there was threat of an abortion

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.498 align:middle line:84%
or a threat of a miscarriage,
what does that do?

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.415 align:middle line:90%
It increases cortisol.

00:47:15.415 --> 00:47:18.990 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And that causes fetal
distress, and that

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:27.300 align:middle line:84%
causes birthing distress, and
that causes more intervention

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.780 align:middle line:90%
at birth.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And so some of us, through
this unconscious trauma,

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:37.320 align:middle line:84%
come into life with our
thermostat set at 110

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and do the shadow
dance with stress

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:90%
our whole life with cortisol.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So that one could be walking
down the beach in Maui

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.590 align:middle line:84%
with a beautiful sunset and
feel stressed out inside.

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:50.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a shadow dance.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:53.110 align:middle line:84%
When we acknowledge
it, we can't change it,

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:56.700 align:middle line:84%
but when we acknowledge that
and we just close our eyes

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and just take a deep breath,
you just reset your adrenals.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:09.630 align:middle line:84%
You just lowered your cortisol
demand, and you can start over.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So from the
biofeedback standpoint,

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.870 align:middle line:84%
from magnesium standpoint,
from diet standpoint,

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.000 align:middle line:84%
there are ways of
addressing things

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that were born with both
inherited and stuff that's

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.720 align:middle line:84%
happened in our life,
including prenatal trauma,

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and then the first
10 years of life

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:37.770 align:middle line:84%
were blank slates we just
imprint on our parents.

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any ego to resist.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I noticed
that in your mandala.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:10%
You see the birth
phase, which is blue.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:47.613 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Oh yeah.

00:48:47.613 --> 00:48:48.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What is that mean?

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:49.580 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:10%
Well blue is-- I'll
just describe--

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.490 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to not
just have a mandala,

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.640 align:middle line:10%
but the human brain
understands color.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So blue is when you're
in perfect state of health.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.370 align:middle line:84%
From first breath
to last, there's

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:06.150 align:middle line:84%
stress, so I introduced
green, and green

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.400 align:middle line:90%
is normal stress state.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's a very
healthy state to be in.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Yellow in the mandala
is an acute stress,

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.300 align:middle line:84%
an acute infection, an
acute allergic reaction,

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:90%
an acute trauma.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:28.500 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a Fibonacci
spiral or a energetic spiral

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:32.700 align:middle line:10%
that mirrors these colors so
that the blue is perfect health

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.530 align:middle line:10%
and good energy and green is--

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:35.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Balanced.

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: --normal energy.

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And yellow is an acute
stress and orange is chronic.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And red is the tipping point,
where the body can no longer

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.680 align:middle line:90%
self-regulate itself.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So the self-healing
capacity of the body

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:84%
can be blocked by physical
scars, by held trauma,

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:04.230 align:middle line:84%
by organic disease, by
localized infection.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:06.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a stone in the
road and the body just

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.910 align:middle line:90%
can't get around it, that's red.

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's a chronic
degenerative autoimmune

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:12.180 align:middle line:90%
disease--

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:19.710 align:middle line:84%
lupus, osteoarthritis,
Crohn's, celiac.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:21.983 align:middle line:90%
And then violet is pathology.

00:50:21.983 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
I see on the one

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.180 align:middle line:90%
having to do with heart attacks.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Right.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That particular--

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: And that particular--

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the purple.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Right.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
different for everybody,

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and there may be a couple
purples, there may be one red.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And so where it emerges has
a lot to do with who you are

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.160 align:middle line:90%
and where you come from.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Genetics.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And also
what's happened to you

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.395 align:middle line:84%
in your life, what
injuries you've had.

00:50:45.395 --> 00:50:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about epigenetics,

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:49.210 align:middle line:90%
the whole field of epigenetics?

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Having to do with the imprinting
of the family emotions

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and belief systems that
come through, as you say--

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --even through
in the birth process--

00:50:56.515 --> 00:50:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in utero.

00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Those are
imprints that we carry.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Those-- so the
violet, the red, the orange

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:09.930 align:middle line:84%
are more advanced
deficiencies of energy,

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:15.300 align:middle line:84%
but also advanced pathology--
or moving towards disease.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the mandala, what's
outside of that mandala

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:21.940 align:middle line:90%
are emergent cycles.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: That's
where disease is.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.152 align:middle line:84%
The mandala is just
the soil out of which--

00:51:26.152 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well you're talking
about the wavy patterns

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.890 align:middle line:84%
around there outside
of the circle.

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Yeah.

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's my
emotional and other?

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: There-- well, it can
be organic disease emerging out

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.300 align:middle line:90%
of that soil.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: It can also be
etheric emotional body trauma,

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just
physical for sure.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's for sure.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:53.475 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're complex,
sentient, empathic creatures,

00:51:53.475 --> 00:51:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and some of us more empathic,
some of us less empathic.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But one thing's for sure,
we're in a body in this life,

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and when someone comes to
me and I'm sensing that--

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:84%
just from their story
and who they are how

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.897 align:middle line:84%
empathic they may
be, those people

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:16.230 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are going
to imprint on their parents,

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:19.120 align:middle line:90%
they feel everyone's pain.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not grounded,
then that empathic ability

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:27.270 align:middle line:90%
does not stop.

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:31.450 align:middle line:84%
An empath can walk into a room
and know how everyone feels

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.250 align:middle line:90%
without them saying a word.

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And if they're grounded,
their energy field's out here,

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.465 align:middle line:84%
they know what's going
on but they don't own it.

00:52:40.465 --> 00:52:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: That same
person has a cup of coffee

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't eat breakfast
and goes to a cocktail party

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and walks in the
room, and everybody's

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:54.610 align:middle line:84%
there, and that ability,
that great ally,

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:57.520 align:middle line:84%
that empathic ability
to read people

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.310 align:middle line:90%
turns into static on a TV set.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And you own everybody's crap,
and you get overwhelmed.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And that grounding has
to do with blood sugar.

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:14.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the-- in terms
of Chinese energetics,

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.720 align:middle line:84%
the earth organs are the
pancreas, the spleen,

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.710 align:middle line:90%
and stomach.

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So that grounding literally
with dietary grounding

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.220 align:middle line:90%
is essential for impasse.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:31.840 align:middle line:84%
If you think about the
chakra system, which

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is an Ayurvedic Indian
concept of physiology

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and endocrinology, the first
chakra is survival, and the--

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and the reproductive organs.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The second chakra is
the kidney, and it's

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:51.040 align:middle line:84%
where one engages
life creatively

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:55.150 align:middle line:84%
or shrinks out of fear
on the other side of it.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:59.560 align:middle line:84%
The third chakra is the
antenna, it's ego organization.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the spleen, the
stomach, gut feelings,

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.750 align:middle line:84%
the liver-- it's
where emotion is held

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.385 align:middle line:90%
and where emotion is felt.

00:54:06.385 --> 00:54:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And people with
diabetes in their family

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:13.240 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes are very
empathic people,

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and it just hits
them right here,

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's just like
almost a giveaway.

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you deny that aspect
of yourself or suppress it,

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:26.680 align:middle line:84%
many times you'll get
pancreatic cancer, diabetes.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you-- ulcers.

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Just problems
with digestion,

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:35.683 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
chakra where you feel--

00:54:35.683 --> 00:54:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have
to recognize and respect

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you are empathic
and treat yourself accordingly

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.182 align:middle line:84%
so that you process that
energy and use it well.

00:54:44.182 --> 00:54:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: I think we all are.

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --all staticy.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: I believe two things.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe that every
human being has genius

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and every human being
is empathic inherently,

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:54.962 align:middle line:90%
and we just don't recognize it.

00:54:54.962 --> 00:54:55.762 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:54:55.762 --> 00:54:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Or it's suppressed
or it's covered over

00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:59.990 align:middle line:90%
or it's not allowed to emerge.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And for many reasons we
won't get into right now.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on up the chakras.

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:06.340 align:middle line:90%
What about the heart?

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.100 align:middle line:84%
To when we get into
the heart chakra?

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Well,
moving that energy

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
have your energy field

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and to protect yourself as well
as to let things in as well

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:25.570 align:middle line:84%
as keep things
out will translate

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:29.560 align:middle line:90%
into love and emotions.

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:38.123 align:middle line:84%
And then this chakra is where
we can verbalize our emotions.

00:55:38.123 --> 00:55:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So by then,
our body's flowing

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.840 align:middle line:84%
in a nice, balanced,
or harmonious state.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: So these systems,
the Ayurvedic system

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.730 align:middle line:84%
or the Chinese
five-element system

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:53.410 align:middle line:84%
are that old story about the
five blind men describing

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:55.180 align:middle line:90%
an elephant.

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.220 align:middle line:84%
The Ayurvedic system
is feeling the trunk

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and the Chinese system
is feeling the tail

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and Western medicine
is feeling the legs,

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and they're convinced that
they're absolutely correct.

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are, and
they're all correct.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.957 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: It's just a different
way of seeing reality.

00:56:10.957 --> 00:56:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let me ask you--

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And I think it's
important to acknowledge that.

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so, too.

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And you have dealt
with thousands

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:18.610 align:middle line:90%
upon thousands of clients, and--

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:20.980 align:middle line:84%
I know just on a personal
level, I've only seen once

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:22.840 align:middle line:84%
and you've been
incredibly helpful to me.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:23.673 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: Thank you.

00:56:23.673 --> 00:56:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so obviously
you've seen things where--

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.420 align:middle line:84%
we only have a
minute or so left--

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.300 align:middle line:84%
where you have people that are
down into those red and even

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.528 align:middle line:84%
have spilled over
into the violet range.

00:56:33.528 --> 00:56:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Many times
have come to me there.

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have been
able to help some back up?

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:42.270 align:middle line:90%


00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm asking you, can we--

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.360 align:middle line:10%
are we really self-healing?

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.360 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: This is-- yes.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To that extent?

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNPHY: If I discuss
these things with people

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.330 align:middle line:10%
and I tell them this,
this is what I want,

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:54.850 align:middle line:10%
this is the essence of healing.

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:57.827 align:middle line:84%
They come in and they're
going in this way.

00:56:57.827 --> 00:56:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going against them.

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: And if I can do a
little turnaround with them

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.970 align:middle line:84%
in a couple of weeks, and I
just flip that cycle to this--

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: --and it's nothing
more than simply an expression

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:16.000 align:middle line:84%
of, I feel a little better,
I can sleep a little better,

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and I know lessons changed
but I want to get better,

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm convinced that
I'm going to get better,

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:24.300 align:middle line:90%
that's the essence of healing.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you can progress
in the right way.

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've seen what
others would consider miracles

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:29.840 align:middle line:90%
happen--

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNPHY: It's simply--

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.438 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --many, many times.

00:57:31.438 --> 00:57:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: --reaching in and
finding a handle to grab

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.450 align:middle line:90%
and flipping the energy.

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:37.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the essence of healing.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on
that note, we're

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:41.760 align:middle line:84%
going to have another
conversation, because we want

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.310 align:middle line:84%
to get into what happens when
you've spilled over the edge

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and your body's on the decline,
and finding our way back

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.390 align:middle line:90%
from some of the worst of it.

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And until then, thank you
so much for your time, Dan.

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNPHY: Thank so
much, thank you.

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:56.250 align:middle line:90%
