00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We're so bombarded

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:10%
with bad news of danger
everywhere that many of us

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.461 align:middle line:10%
tend to turn the other
cheek, literally,

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:10%
when we learn that the stuff
we're putting on our skin

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:10%
and face are artificial or
even carcinogenic chemicals.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.492 align:middle line:84%
It's just one more
thing that will kill us.

00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:37.908 align:middle line:84%
But what if you
could put products

00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
on your face that
feed your skin,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:90%
just like you feed your body?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Joshua Onysko started
playing around

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
with using foods for
skin care and ultimately

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
started an organic skin
care company called Pangea.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
He's here to tell us some
shocking info regarding what's

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
on store shelves in
our skin care products,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to offer
us a better solution.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think I've
kind of said that.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.967 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSHUA ONYSKO:
Thanks for having me.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, I put
a lot-- I can't imagine some

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:84%
of the stuff I put on
isn't carcinogenic.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:10%
When I started listening to
some of what you had to say--

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:10%
how many carcinogenic
chemicals are we

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:10%
exposed to every
day, most of us--

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:10%
not even counting women
with all the stuff

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:10%
we put on our face and hair.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.358 align:middle line:10%
>>ONYSKO: Well the
average American

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:10%
puts about 500 chemicals
on their body a day

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:10%
before they leave the house.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people--
I'll say that fact

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
at a meeting or a talk,
and people usually

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:90%
react-- oh, not me.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not me.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: I don't
use that much stuff.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes I'll
say, well, great.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.613 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to your bathroom.

00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And we'll lay out the problem.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Like, show me what
you used this morning,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:90%
and they lay out the products.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually between
nine and 12 products-- which,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.105 align:middle line:84%
that off the bat, they're a
little shocked on, because you

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
don't think about how
many products you're--

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.015 align:middle line:84%
Because you think your shampoo,
and then you've got soap for--

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:50.165 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Deodorant and
shampoo and toothpaste--

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
deodorant, toothpaste.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: And face
cream, shaving gel--

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.467 align:middle line:90%
you know, it all adds up.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look at these
products and turn them around,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
you can't pronounce most of the
ingredients that are in there.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.901 align:middle line:84%
But as consumers,
we generally don't

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
think about reading
all of the ingredients

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.149 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
what they all are.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But these ingredients
are getting soaked

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
into our bloodstream, because
our skin is our largest organ.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's absorbing up to 60%
to 70% of what we put on it.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.374 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to ask
you a question first.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of things--
I can pronounce it,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.971 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know what it means.

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
What does Pangea mean?

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Pangea was the name
of the supercontinent about 300

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:90%
million years ago, before--

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's where it
derived its name.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Correct.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.717 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, how very organic.

00:02:28.717 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Exactly.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one of the
things you write about

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and talk about is the
fact that 95% of products

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
are not the product you
think you're getting,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that's being advertised,
but actually fillers.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start
launching in to what's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:90%
in the stuff we put on us.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:10%
>>ONYSKO: So when you go out
and buy a cosmetic product,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:10%
it's usually made
of 95% filler, which

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:10%
means it's generally a
petroleum-based filler.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:10%
Fills up the packaging.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.731 align:middle line:10%
And then the company
will put a couple percent

00:02:57.731 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:10%
of what's called an active
ingredient, which gives you

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:10%
this desired effect,
whether it's moisturizing

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:10%
or hydrating or removing
fine lines or wrinkles.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.629 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting
this effect, which

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
makes you think, oh,
the product's working.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But then the next
morning you wake up

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
reapply and reapply.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's not feeding the skin.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually adding
nutrition to the skin.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just giving you
this desired effect.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we're using plants and
plants are distilled properly

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and combined properly and
the product is being created

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
properly, plants
can actually deliver

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
both the immediate effects
but also long-term nourishment

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.747 align:middle line:90%
for the skin.

00:03:30.747 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying
earlier, your skin

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:90%
is your largest organ.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to be feeding it
the same things that we're

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:90%
feeding our body.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And as we were talking
about before the show,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
95% of skin care and
skin health is nutrition.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know, that's true.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And that makes total sense.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.596 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to bring
something up in a little bit.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing that happens
is as technology and science

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
has seeped its way into
the beauty industry,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:84%
it becomes
increasingly difficult,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:84%
it seems, for people to get
the same kind of results

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:84%
with basically
food products that

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
have been turned
into beauty products.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, that's
a really big one,

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:90%
is the effectiveness factor.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us the argument
between the two and really

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.353 align:middle line:84%
where you can
settle comfortably.

00:04:19.353 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well I
think a lot of it

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
is finding-- if you're
to go the organic route,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
there's a couple important
things to understand.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.867 align:middle line:84%
Just like conventional
products, there's

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
good conventional
products and there's

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:90%
bad conventional products.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And in organic,
there's good and bad.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
What you have to be
looking for is the product

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that works for you that is
also spending a lot of time

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
on the science end of
the organic spectrum.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.664 align:middle line:84%
Organic ingredients
are amazing when

00:04:43.664 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
they're formulated properly.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: But if you're not
extracting something properly,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.411 align:middle line:84%
if you're not extracting long
enough, if you're not combining

00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
them properly, they're just
as useless as anything else.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the science comes down
to finding which ingredients

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
are bioavailable,
which means are

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.880 align:middle line:84%
absorbable into the human
skin, that are giving us

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:84%
desired effects, like
antioxidants, skin cell

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
regenerating ingredients, things
that are adding more vitamins

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and nutrients to
the skin and helping

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.797 align:middle line:90%
the skin at a cellular level.

00:05:12.797 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when you're
talking about bioavailability,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I find it interesting
because when

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for
the bioavailability

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:90%
of the good stuff.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So you want something that
says bioavailable nutrients.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
what you're saying

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
is that our bodies are
absorbing the bad stuff.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the bad stuff's
bioavailable too, right?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Oh, it's
very bioavailable.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
something they'd

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:90%
necessarily want to brag about.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
what we're absorbing.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
the carcinogenic chemicals

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.205 align:middle line:84%
and the formaldehyde effects
and such that we're absorbing.

00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so many of the
preservative systems,

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the emulsifiers, the emollients
are, in fact, carcinogenic.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
cosmetic industry really

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.550 align:middle line:84%
took a pivot in the
1950s when people

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
started creating synthetic
versions of the natural things

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:90%
that we were using as a culture.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
surfactin is what

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
foams up and removes dirt and
oil from our skin and our body.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And forever the surfactant that
the world used was called soap.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.622 align:middle line:84%
And that was usually
saponified palm oil or--

00:06:15.622 --> 00:06:16.455 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oil-based.

00:06:16.455 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.556 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: --or olive
oil or coconut oil.

00:06:18.556 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1950s, one of
the larger manufacturers

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
started creating
synthetic surfactants.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's where sodium
lauryl sulfate, cocamide DEA,

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
cocamidopropyl betaine--
all of these things

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
started bubbling to the
surface, because they're

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot less expensive
to use in the products.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And when people ask me like
when this change happened,

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.609 align:middle line:84%
everyone remembers
the product Palmolive.

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Palmolive, yes.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well Palmolive used to
be made of palm and olive oil.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not anymore, but that's
how the product was started.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.988 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't know that.

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about-- well,
without talking about brands,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.940 align:middle line:84%
because we're not going to be
bashing any brands here today.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.305 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
commercial soaps

00:06:56.305 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that, when you're
done bathing in them,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
you feel almost dirtier because
they leave this strange residue

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:84%
on your skin, as opposed to some
of the natural oil-based soaps,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.695 align:middle line:90%
which I certainly prefer.

00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
When I started Pangea, I
had made a batch of soap

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
with my mom as a bonding
project before I left for India.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had taken some of the
bars in my backpack with me.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And I was in India.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:90%
This was October, 1999.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.707 align:middle line:84%
And in my entire life, all
I had ever used was Ivory.

00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So that I thought that's
what showering was,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
showering felt like.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was not
going to say the name.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the soap I
was referring to.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.618 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:07:29.618 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's just
what I grew up with.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I started using this
soap that I'd made with my mom,

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and I was kind of shocked.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:90%
I was like, this lathers up.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.064 align:middle line:90%
It smells great.

00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has a really
creamy kind of beautiful lather.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.521 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Creamy texture.

00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I got out of the shower,
and I just felt my skin.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't smell those
chemicals on my skin.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't itchy.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.235 align:middle line:84%
You know, with commercial soaps,
you get that film on your skin.

00:07:53.235 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
talking about, that film.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: And that
was what gave me

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.599 align:middle line:90%
the inspiration to start this.

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I was like, why
are these not more

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:90%
readily available for consumers?

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Do consumers know that
there's a better option?

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:90%
So how do you make soap?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.582 align:middle line:84%
When you and your
mom were making soap,

00:08:06.582 --> 00:08:07.373 align:middle line:90%
how do you do that?

00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:09.769 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Soap is a combination
of an alkali and a fat.

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:90%
So how you make it?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: So what we
were using was sodium--

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:90%
or it's called lye.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And lye is actually salt
water with electricity running

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
through it, which makes that
powder, which is a base.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is what you
use to also cure olives.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Exactly.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It's what you use
to cure olives.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:90%
So you add water to that base.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And then you take fats.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, I was using olive
oil, coconut oil, hemp oil,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:90%
and soybean oil.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And you get the temperatures to
match, and you combine the two.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is a process
called saponification.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And once it starts saponifying,
there's no longer an alkali

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:90%
and there's no longer an oil.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:90%
You have soap.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And the byproduct is glycerine,
and the good soap companies

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
leave the glycerin in
the soap, because that's

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
what's hydrating your skin along
with all the emollient oils.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And then once it
starts thickening,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
you add your herbs, your
essential oils, your flowers,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want
that bar soap to be.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you pour it into
casks, and you cure them.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And our soap takes about four
or five weeks to fully cure.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And what about the ones that are
more clarified or liquid soap,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.644 align:middle line:90%
like Dr. Bronner's?

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I know we can talk about
Bronner's, because we

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:90%
both like it.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: I love Dr. Bronner's.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:90%
And, you know.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bronner's and Pangea have
a very similar standpoint

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:90%
on soap.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.760 align:middle line:84%
They make real soap,
and so does Pangea.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Dr.
Bronner's has bar soap

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and liquid soap,
just like Pangea.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And the liquid soap
is made the same way,

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.346 align:middle line:84%
except instead of
using sodium hydroxide,

00:09:42.346 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
you're using potassium
hydroxide, which

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
makes a liquid soap
instead of a bar soap.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.099 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
only main difference.

00:09:49.099 --> 00:09:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some--
that's the good stuff.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to know.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I've never made soap, you know?

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was curious to see if it
was a difficult thing to do.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: The next
show, we'll have

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:90%
a little soap-making project.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:90%
That would be fun.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And I do.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And I totally appreciate
the difference

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
between a commercial grocery
store soap and the soaps

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.455 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the list of
some of the carcinogens that

00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
are more common
than others if we're

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
going to the normal daily
routine, for example,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.104 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that are really
easy to weed out and still

00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:84%
have the kind of
results you want,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:84%
for whether it's cleaning your
teeth or your hair or whatnot.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.189 align:middle line:84%
What are the top
10 really bad guys?

00:10:26.189 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: It's hard to
pinpoint the top 10.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.727 align:middle line:84%
We do have an
infographic that I think

00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:90%
they have prepared for the show.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.226 align:middle line:10%
But one of the ones that's
been really common that's

00:10:33.226 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:10%
also been a hot
topic is triclosan.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:10%
So triclosan is
the ingredient that

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:10%
is an all of these
antimicrobial antibacterial

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:10%
soaps and hand sanitizers.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about
these all the time.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And triclosan is
really toxic for us,

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's also very toxic
for the environment.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, natural
soap, like Pangea's, has

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of bacteria and
antimicrobial fighting effects.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.991 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
the ingredient you

00:11:02.991 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:84%
use to do the
antimicrobial effects?

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: It's just soap.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Just the basic soap.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, soap has been used
for thousands of years.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
triclosan is it's

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
killing the good and the
bad bacteria on our skin.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not allowing us to have
any good bacteria on our skin.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that the stuff
in the little squeezy bottles,

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
with the hand purifiers?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:90%
You find it--

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yes.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.258 align:middle line:84%
But they also put
it in hand soaps.

00:11:21.258 --> 00:11:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Every time you use the
soap at a bathroom,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%
if they're not
using good product,

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:90%
there's triclosan in there.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because what are the
health effects of triclosan?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: It's a carcinogen.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.269 align:middle line:90%
Just flat out.

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Flat out.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.757 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
one of the top ones.

00:11:33.757 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:84%
What are another few
that are really--

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.673 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Sodium lauryl sulfate.

00:11:36.673 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's a skin irritant.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:10%
Sodium hydroxymethylglycinate
is one that I see a lot.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:10%
And sodium
hydroxymethylglycinate

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:10%
is what kind of hit the market
after all the reports came out

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:10%
about methyl ethyl
propyl parabens.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.820 align:middle line:10%
And parabens are still
all over the market.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:10%
Lots of the conventional brands
and cosmetic counter brands

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:10%
are still using parabens.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're extremely
toxic for the human body.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But they started
replacing it with sodium

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.334 align:middle line:90%
hydroxymethylglycinate.

00:12:05.334 --> 00:12:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
about the cosmetic industry,

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:84%
or even the food industry, is
once the media catches wind

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.421 align:middle line:84%
of something that's
not good-- it pops up,

00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
there's all these
articles and interviews,

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden consumers
are asking retailers and brands

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:90%
to ban it.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is replacing it

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
with something that's
probably just as toxic,

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.995 align:middle line:84%
but the media hasn't
heard about it yet.

00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And sodium
hydroxymethylglycinate

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.328 align:middle line:90%
is one of those things.

00:12:27.328 --> 00:12:29.379 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a precursor
to formaldehyde.

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you're
replacing one bad thing

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.128 align:middle line:90%
with another bad thing.

00:12:32.128 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
this happens is

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.930 align:middle line:84%
these synthetic
preservatives and emulsifiers

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and so forth and so on
are extremely inexpensive.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you compare
the cost of the types

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:84%
of sophisticated preservative
systems that Pangea's using

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:84%
or the fact that we're using
natural surfactants compared

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
to what they're spending, it's
hard to break out of that cycle

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.754 align:middle line:90%
that they're in.

00:12:54.754 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
bringing to the market

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.399 align:middle line:84%
is something that-- it is
more expensive than a lot

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:84%
of the products that
you're generally

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
going to find, as you
say, at the grocery store.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But the effectiveness of
them and how long they last

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:90%
outweighs that.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
really high end companies,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:84%
like Sisley or La Mer and
some of the French companies

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and Swiss companies,
for example, that

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
charge far more than
what Pangea charges,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and they claim to use-- well,
they do use botanicals in them.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Are they just using like
a hint of a botanical

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and the same old stuff that
everybody else is using,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:90%
or how does that go?

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: You
know, this has also

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:84%
been a hot topic on the web
for the past several months.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But the whole concept of
natural or greenwashing-- I

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
did a show on KGNU this
morning about greenwashing.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
like this magic wand.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's this really
funny YouTube video

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that's like, just
put all natural,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.016 align:middle line:84%
and then put a barn
on it, and people

00:13:54.016 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%
will think that
it's all natural.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And what does the term
"all natural" mean?

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So I explain to
people, especially

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:84%
with food-- all
natural, the components

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that are still in that food
can be genetically modified,

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
they're being sprayed with
pesticides and herbicides

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:90%
and fungicides.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:90%
And what's natural about that?

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
food and skin care,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.034 align:middle line:84%
because your skin is absorbing
most of what you put on it,

00:14:16.034 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
you really want to focus
on organic for two reasons.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.325 align:middle line:84%
One, you're getting
all those-- you're

00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
not exposing yourself
to all those toxins.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And two, organic
ingredients and food

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:29.755 align:middle line:84%
have 30% more antioxidants
than conventional.

00:14:29.755 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about-- I heard you

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in one interview talking about
transparency in labeling.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.385 align:middle line:90%
And I found it fascinating.

00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned something
I hadn't known about,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:90%
which was that in hotels--

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Ha ha.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.829 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In hotels, when you
have those little bottles--

00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Not for resale.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:49.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:49.495 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Not for resale bottles of
shampoos, conditioners,

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and, you know,
body creams, things

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
like that, that they
don't have to have

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
any of the actual ingredients
necessarily in them

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that the parent company's
name who's being used

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:90%
uses in their products.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Correct.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain this
whole thing to us.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:90%
That's really weird.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.364 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: I mean, everyone knows
somebody who goes in the hotel

00:15:10.364 --> 00:15:12.994 align:middle line:84%
rooms and they
see fancy brand A.

00:15:12.994 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they steal it.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: And they're like, oh!

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, not stealing it,
because they paid for it.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't
know is this is

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:90%
how the hotel industry works.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's about
three manufacturers

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
in the country that
kind of service

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
most of the hotels
in the country.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when they see a brand
rising, they go to that brand

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and say hey, we'd
like to represent you

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:90%
in the hospitality industry.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
We will give you two
pennies a bottle,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and plus this signing fee,
and so forth and so on.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And you give us the rights to
your branding and your scent,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and we take care of the rest.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So to most brands, they're
like, that's amazing.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to do anything.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't
they stop and say,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.462 align:middle line:84%
but will you be
using our product?

00:15:50.462 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, they
know, because that's

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.044 align:middle line:90%
part of the contract.

00:15:53.044 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is these companies

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:90%
buy the rights to these brands.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they go and they
make some more toxic, very

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.784 align:middle line:84%
inexpensive, usually
made in China--

00:16:02.784 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to say, yeah.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Almost
always made in China.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.822 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:05.822 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:90%
China.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.963 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: And then they
add the fragrance and then

00:16:07.963 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
the branding, and so
the person at the hotel

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
thinks they're getting
whatever brand they think

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:84%
they're getting, but
it's not that brand.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It's actually more
toxic than that brand.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is your
average four or five star hotel

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.235 align:middle line:84%
will only spend about
$0.20, $0.22 cents a bottle.

00:16:24.235 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a really
high-end hotel, you mean?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.068 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: That's a
really high-end hotel.

00:16:28.068 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them go
as high as $0.48.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where is that?

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.716 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, to give you
an example of what that means,

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
when we were approached
by one-- actually

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
two of these companies-- to
buy the rights to Pangea,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:84%
we said great, but we're only
going to use our product.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to give
consumers toxic BS.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: And they
were like, fine.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.608 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:16:46.608 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Give us your formulation.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And they came back, and they're
like, you can't do this.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well
what do you mean?

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.009 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
well, your product

00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:90%
will cost over $1 bottle.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.242 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well,
people are paying $300--

00:16:56.242 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're paying
$300 a night for your hotel.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:84%
They're like, it'll never
happen in the hotel industry.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.858 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:17:01.858 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Not at all.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those
situations-- buyer beware.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
And people thought the
duvet was the dirtiest

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
thing in their hotel
room, but it's actually

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:90%
the skin care in the bathroom.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:14.192 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
little disconcerting,

00:17:14.192 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:84%
because some of the names are
well-known for being among

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.986 align:middle line:90%
the more natural lines of--

00:17:19.986 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Well, that's it.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.829 align:middle line:84%
You just did the quotations,
right? "Natural."

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
There's only a handful
of us out there

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:84%
that are completely
organic and non-toxic.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the DNA of our brand.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's not smoke and mirrors.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not a barn and
a field of lavender

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to kind of distract the consumer
from all of the chemicals.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times you
go on these websites.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:84%
People are always
saying to me, oh, I just

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:90%
found this new organic brand.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.067 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing
completely toxic-free.

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, great.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Send me the URL.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And if I go to the website
and you click on Ingredients,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and it says Active Ingredients
and it just shows you

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.859 align:middle line:84%
all the organic
ingredients-- consumers

00:17:55.859 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that
that's not the ingredients.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.358 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
ingredients that they

00:17:59.358 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
want to show you
that they're using.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why consumers
don't understand this

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:08.181 align:middle line:84%
is most consumers think that the
cosmetic industry is regulated.

00:18:08.181 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: It's not
regulated by anybody.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.640 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
bathtub and an oar,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you can make lotion and
put it on the market.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
No one's regulating you.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: And it's
good and bad, right?

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So the FDA does not regulate
the cosmetic industry.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly,
I don't they're

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.505 align:middle line:84%
doing a good job with
food and/or drugs.

00:18:29.505 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:90%
So I wouldn't--

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Their stamp of approval wouldn't
mean anything to people anyway.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:32.912 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:35.162 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want them regulating
the cosmetic industry.

00:18:35.162 --> 00:18:37.601 align:middle line:84%
But consumers need
to be more educated

00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
about what they're buying
and what they're using

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and find brands that
they want to support,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:90%
because it's your health.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
really bothers me

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
about a lot of these
cosmetic brands

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:84%
is they're making money in
exchange for people's health.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
They're literally
putting thousands

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and thousands and thousands
of pounds of chemicals

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:84%
onto people's bodies,
onto people's children,

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
into the environment, and
they're making a profit off it,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're pretending that
they don't know any better when,

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
in fact, they do.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about INCI-- I-N-C-I.

00:19:10.495 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
that and the labeling.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.894 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: It's the
International Nomenclature

00:19:13.894 --> 00:19:16.790 align:middle line:84%
for Cosmetic Ingredients
is what that acronym means.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they don't
list the preservatives

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.704 align:middle line:84%
or the emulsifiers or any of
those things on the labels?

00:19:21.704 --> 00:19:22.745 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Oh no, they do.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are required to?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.125 align:middle line:10%
>>ONYSKO: They're required
to, but I can't tell you

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:27.994 align:middle line:10%
how many times I go
and look at a product

00:19:27.994 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:10%
and I know there's no
preservative listed, because I

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:10%
know what a preservative is.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:10%
They just leave it off.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:10%
And because it's unregulated,
they usually don't get fined.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:10%


00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Theoretically, that
is the oversight organization,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.814 align:middle line:10%
but you don't have
to adhere to it?

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Right.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a--

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, INCI isn't
really an organization.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just an acronym.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way for brands to
have kind of a specific format

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to list its ingredients that
are recognized globally.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.452 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:54.452 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And they can do what they
want with that information.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Right.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Sunscreens.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk to
you about sunscreens.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: So, you know, I
have a very different approach

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:90%
to sunscreen.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:13.275 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't believe
in, so to speak, topical SPFs.

00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, SPF is
regulated by the FDA.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.984 align:middle line:84%
The minute you make
a medical claim,

00:20:17.984 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:84%
you're being
regulated by the FDA.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And SPF is a medical claim.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're saying
my product is 30 SPF,

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:84%
it needs to be
regulated by the FDA.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
They're not
regulating the safety

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:90%
of what's holding the SPF.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:84%
They're just making
sure that if you're

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
telling your consumer it
has 30 SPF, it has 30 SPF.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:84%
My whole view around
a lot of sunscreens

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
are that we're depriving
ourselves of vitamin D,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:90%
and the sun is our friend.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies were
designed to actually tell us

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
when we should get
out of the sun.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start getting
red or you start getting hot

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.285 align:middle line:84%
or you're getting a
burn-- get out of the sun.

00:20:54.285 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But in the West, you
know, when someone's

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
crossing the
Serengeti, they're not

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
wearing booty shorts
and a halter top.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:90%
They're covering all their skin.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:84%
But we want to live
in this different way.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to wear the booty shorts
and the halter top and blah,

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to smear all
this stuff all over our body.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening is the sun
is still beating on our skin.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It's still mutating
our skin cells.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:84%
We're still getting exposed
to UVA and UVB light,

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
but we're not
getting the signals

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:90%
that we've had too much sun.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And so it's this false
sense of security.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
like I'm on the fence.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell people
not to wear sunscreen.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I just tell people to be more
cautious about their amount

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:90%
of sun exposure.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:40.124 align:middle line:84%
And the best form of sunscreen
is usually a parasol or a hat.

00:21:40.124 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:90%
A big floppy hat.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.445 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: A big floppy hat.

00:21:42.445 --> 00:21:43.861 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about the old stuff

00:21:43.861 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that used to be around
before sunscreens became

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated, where
your nose was white?

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:90%
It was titanium oxide or--

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Oh, yeah,
like beach volleyball.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.117 align:middle line:84%
Well titanium dioxide
and zinc oxide--

00:21:53.117 --> 00:21:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.325 align:middle line:90%
And zinc oxide.

00:21:54.325 --> 00:21:58.075 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: --are what natural
sunscreen companies use.

00:21:58.075 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's safe to
a certain extent,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:90%
but it's clogging your pores.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It's giving you that
false sense of security.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's also ending
up in the environment,

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:84%
because, at the end of
the day, they're metals.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So they're ending up in
our reefs and our oceans

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent a lot of
time using my nutrition

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:90%
as my sunscreen.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:84%
You can take blue green
algae and chlorella,

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of things internally

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that will help you protect
yourself from the sun

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you say,
it is a chemical interaction

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Before I get to the
point I'm going to make,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:84%
is there some maybe
potential that the sun,

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
with all of its
intelligence and power,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
is actually working
in a negative fashion

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.449 align:middle line:84%
with these chemicals
on the body as well?

00:22:44.449 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: It's very possible,
but I don't have enough--

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.417 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:47.417 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just occurring to me that
it might be detrimental in ways

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:90%
we're not--

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: It's
like cooking them.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like cooking
them and driving them

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.776 align:middle line:90%
in even further.

00:22:52.776 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: I'm sure.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But years
ago, I remember

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.666 align:middle line:84%
when I was a news anchor doing
a special series on sugar.

00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it was based on
an old book called The Sugar

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.154 align:middle line:90%
Blues.

00:23:03.154 --> 00:23:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I remember reading

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:84%
in there that was
so interesting was

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:84%
talking about the skin and
sunburn and sugar consumption--

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:90%
simple carbohydrates.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
That the more of
those you consume,

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:84%
the more the skin is
susceptible to burning

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:90%
and other abnormalities.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, with anything--
again, it comes back to diet.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:84%
If you formulate you diet
around high antioxidants

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and mineral and vitamin
versus high sugar,

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be better off.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: People are spending
thousands and thousands

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:84%
of dollars on-- and
I'll be the first one

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:90%
to say this-- skin care.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And nutrition is the best
way to treat your skin.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, topical
products are amazing,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and it attributes to about
5% of the visual appearance

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:90%
of your skin.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Nutrition is everything.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:90%
More vegetables.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:90%
More vegetables.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:90%
More vegetables.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More vegetables
and more clean water sources.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: And more clean water.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Clean hydration.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: And attitude.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and attitude.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part that
is not as quantifiable.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But to me, I see the difference
in people all the time.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:84%
If you have a good attitude,
if you are hopeful about life,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
if you have some joy and you
don't buy in to the existing

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:84%
paradigms of thinking,
you look different.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Exactly.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.921 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know?

00:24:16.921 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:90%
And that trumps genetics.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Almost all the time.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Almost all the time.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing I heard
you talk about that I thought

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most
shocking things you said.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It was-- we're going to
talk about deodorants now.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:84%
It was that there is a
phenomena of people having

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Botox injected
into their armpits.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Oh, god.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain this.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
weirdest things--

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: You've been
digging in to my blog.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the weirdest
things I've ever heard of.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.465 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:24:45.465 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
People are obsessed
with stopping sweating,

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.122 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of amazing to me.

00:24:51.122 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think
people understand--

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.884 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:24:52.884 --> 00:24:54.030 align:middle line:84%
There are people
that are obsessed

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.040 align:middle line:90%
with stopping sweating?

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.498 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah,
because they see it

00:24:56.498 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:84%
as this kind of foul part
of the human experience.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.579 align:middle line:84%
And they literally inject
Botox into their armpits.

00:25:03.579 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are doctors
that will do this for them?

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.825 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: There's doctors to
do a lot more weird things

00:25:07.825 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I guess they'll do
anything if you pay money.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:09.772 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:09.772 --> 00:25:10.522 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's true.

00:25:10.522 --> 00:25:13.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that stops the
process of sweating?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: That will stop
the process of sweating.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, above and
beyond that-- obviously

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that's on the smaller
side of the spectrum,

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:84%
because obviously
there's not millions

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:90%
of people getting Botox.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, I'd just never
heard of anything like that.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:26.595 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:25:26.595 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Me either.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.958 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: I was blogging
about deodorants

00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and how toxic it is to be
putting aluminum and these--

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:84%
the worst, and we didn't talk
about this yet, is perfumes,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.730 align:middle line:84%
synthetic fragrances can have
up to 300 chemicals in it that

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:90%
aren't even listed on the label.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And so all these
synthetic deodorants

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:84%
with heavy metals and perfumes
underneath our armpits

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:84%
that are going right
into our bloodstream,

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:84%
blocking sweat,
which is literally

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.110 align:middle line:90%
how our body eliminates toxins.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty bad.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was interviewing
I think it was

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Anthony Gucciardi a while back.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me that his
favorite deodorant was just

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:90%
slicing fresh limes--

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.725 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Lemon.

00:26:11.725 --> 00:26:12.225 align:middle line:90%
Lime?

00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lime.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Not lemon.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Oh, wow.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.529 align:middle line:90%
A little Latin flair.

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Lime works.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.905 align:middle line:90%
Lemon burns.

00:26:16.905 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I tried to substitute
it out one time.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Lime, just fresh
lime, is probably

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the best deodorant
that I've ever found.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.617 align:middle line:84%
And yet lemon had my
armpits scalded for days.

00:26:27.617 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was terrible.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, how much
lemon were you using?

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just the same thing--
just rub a fresh lemon slice

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.504 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:26:32.504 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
difference was, but wow.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Oh.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:84%
See what I do is you
can put a little lemon

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.519 align:middle line:90%
in some coconut oil.

00:26:37.519 --> 00:26:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.351 align:middle line:90%
Now that would be better, sure.

00:26:39.351 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: But the
reality is all I

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.635 align:middle line:84%
do is I just put a couple
drops of an essential oil,

00:26:44.635 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which one?

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.715 align:middle line:90%
Just any essential oil?

00:26:47.715 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.927 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of essential oils
have natural antibacterial.

00:26:50.927 --> 00:26:52.385 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
great about that.

00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.324 align:middle line:84%
Lavender in particular,
which is also I

00:26:54.324 --> 00:26:56.530 align:middle line:90%
think why so many "natural"--

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Deodorants
have lavender oil?

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.765 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: You know, the
thing about deodorant

00:27:00.765 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of people get
confused between antiperspirant

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and deodorant.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And nobody, even if you use
toxins in your skin care

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.467 align:middle line:84%
and you don't care--
antiperspirant

00:27:13.467 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:84%
is the worst thing you
can put on your body.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:16.175 --> 00:27:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: You are literally
jamming heavy metals

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.580 align:middle line:90%
into your body.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And so your body
is made to sweat.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you sweat too
much, try to approach it

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:90%
from a holistic standpoint.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Go see a naturopath.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Find out what's causing the
overactive sebaceous glands,

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and address it from a
nutritional standpoint.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Deodorant is
something that's just

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.480 align:middle line:84%
meant to kill the
bacteria causing--

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.026 align:middle line:90%
the odor-causing bacteria.

00:27:43.026 --> 00:27:45.442 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can do that with a
lot of different things-- salt

00:27:45.442 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and lemon and coconut
oil and essential oils.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:49.983 align:middle line:90%
Again, it comes back to diet.

00:27:49.983 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Your BO is going to be
directly tethered to your diet.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Drink a lot of coffee, smoke
cigarettes, have two cocktails

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.970 align:middle line:84%
after work-- guess what your
BO's going to smell like.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.983 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, verses if
you're doing more-- I

00:28:03.983 --> 00:28:06.150 align:middle line:90%
don't even have to say.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: If you just eat rose
pedals all day and drink water.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.841 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You spent
time in India.

00:28:10.841 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.545 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
one of these-- Now

00:28:13.545 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
we'll go into ingredients--
the specific ones that are real

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:90%
buzzes in the beauty market.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of them that's popped
up in the last few years

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:90%
is the Moroccan argan oil.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.517 align:middle line:84%
What is that, and
why should we care?

00:28:26.517 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Argan oil is
an amazing ingredient

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that we use in a
bunch of our products.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from a nut.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:90%
And it grows in trees.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:34.891 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah.

00:28:34.891 --> 00:28:35.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.223 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, what's
different from that

00:28:37.223 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
than almond oil or
any other nut oil?

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.425 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: The
thing about oils is

00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:42.985 align:middle line:84%
they all have different
properties to them.

00:28:42.985 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I have never
said, hey, there's

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.972 align:middle line:84%
one oil that is the panacea
to all skin problems.

00:28:48.972 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of
raw foodist are like,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.984 align:middle line:84%
I just use coconut
oil on my entire body.

00:28:52.984 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And coconut oil is great,
but you should never

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.424 align:middle line:84%
put it on your face
because it's communagentic.

00:28:57.424 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that?

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Communagentic.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.570 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.778 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Communagentic
means it goes into your pores

00:29:01.778 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and clogs them and can
actually cause premature aging.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So coconut oil is great
on your skin, you know,

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:84%
on your body and your feet and
hands and arms and whatnot,

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
but the second you start
putting straight coconut

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:84%
oil on your face, you can
start clogging your pores.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:10%
So the science behind
blending different oils

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.890 align:middle line:10%
is looking at your palate.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.610 align:middle line:10%
And your palate is
every oil that the Earth

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:10%
has to offer, from safflower
from the Midwest here

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.640 align:middle line:10%
all the way to
Moroccan argan oil,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.720 align:middle line:10%
and figuring out which
percentages of those oils

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.490 align:middle line:10%
should be blended together to
get the effects that you're

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:10%
looking for out of a product.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So argan oil is
just one of them.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And, like you said, it's
the hot word, right.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:90%
The press--

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
see it all over.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.016 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
packaging argan oil.

00:29:43.016 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
How do they know that
that Moroccan argan

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:84%
oil is any different
from your use of it?

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well,
always go for organic.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Because like anything
else, if it's not organic,

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:84%
it's got pesticides
and herbicides on it.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And which brings me
to a great point.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Oils, whether they're
base oils, which

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.700 align:middle line:84%
are the argan, the
safflower, the olive oil,

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.465 align:middle line:84%
and essential oils,
it's extremely important

00:30:05.465 --> 00:30:06.090 align:middle line:90%
to buy organic.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:07.393 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:07.393 --> 00:30:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: When these
foods are harvested,

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.650 align:middle line:84%
they're usually processed
into oil within hours,

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:90%
right on the farm.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
buying organic, there's

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:20.230 align:middle line:84%
no process where they're
harvesting it and washing

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:84%
off all the pesticides
and the herbicides

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:84%
before it's going to
be created into an oil.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
pressing these plants,

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.020 align:middle line:84%
you're getting those pesticides
and herbicides and fungicides

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
in the oil in a very
concentrated format.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So I've visited our
essential oil farms

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.880 align:middle line:84%
all over the world that grow
our oils, and you watch them.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:84%
They cut the plant
and it literally

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.940 align:middle line:84%
goes onto a tractor
right into the distillery

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:90%
that's right there on the farm.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
important to buy

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.490 align:middle line:84%
things that are not being
sprayed with chemicals.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.034 align:middle line:90%
What about olive oil?

00:30:53.034 --> 00:30:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I was telling a little
story off-camera.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, my
mother's only friend

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.020 align:middle line:84%
at the time in the apartment
building was Italian.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:03.156 align:middle line:84%
And so she told her to
rub me down in olive oil.

00:31:03.156 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So she'd rub my little
body down in olive oil

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.830 align:middle line:84%
and sit me in the
windowsill, and everybody

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.986 align:middle line:84%
commented on how
beautiful my skin was

00:31:08.986 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:90%
when I was a little kid.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.164 align:middle line:90%
What about olive oil?

00:31:12.164 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Olive oil's great.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it OK for the skin?

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.693 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Oh, it's
great for the skin.

00:31:15.693 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't, you know, lather
your whole body in it.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.401 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, well I was small.

00:31:19.401 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:90%
I was a wee thing.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: I mean, you look
fabulous, so it worked.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, there's no
negative effects to olive oil.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Olive oil is one of the
things that you always--

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.444 align:middle line:84%
if you're on a
super tight budget

00:31:30.444 --> 00:31:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and you really feel like
you can't afford everything

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:84%
organic, oils should
always be the first thing

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:90%
that you only buy organically.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:38.139 --> 00:31:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't afford
a lot of beauty products,

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.590 align:middle line:84%
if you have a nice organic
olive oil in there for salads,

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:90%
just-- yeah?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Absolutely.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And now let's get into
some of the chemicals,

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.310 align:middle line:84%
because this particular
one-- squalene.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Squalene came out
as something that

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.767 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the miracle chemical
for the face a few years.

00:31:57.767 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: The miracle
of the week, you mean?

00:31:59.600 --> 00:31:59.652 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:59.652 --> 00:32:00.670 align:middle line:90%
The miracle of the week.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
discredited for having

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:90%
some very negative properties.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:05.970 align:middle line:90%
What is squalene?

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, there's many
different forms of squalene.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.323 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about it.

00:32:10.323 --> 00:32:12.367 align:middle line:10%
>>ONYSKO: We use squalene
in our eye cream.

00:32:12.367 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Eye cream.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:13.990 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about it.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.590 align:middle line:10%
That's why I'm asking.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:16.590 align:middle line:10%
>>ONYSKO: And so the
squalene that we're getting

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.940 align:middle line:10%
is derived from olive oil,
or from olives, rather.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
squalene, first of all?

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.540 align:middle line:84%
What's it credited
with doing that all

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.132 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmetic companies
are using it, or so many are?

00:32:26.132 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: So I believe
it's a collagen-builder,

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.670 align:middle line:90%
is what it's being praised for.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a chemical
component of like, olive oil

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:90%
or olives?

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, in the
light of this conversation,

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:90%
it's a chemical.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But in our situation, it's a
naturally occurring chemical.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a
synthesized chemical.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.370 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of squalenes.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.850 align:middle line:84%
There are some squalenes that
come from animal, which--

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought
some came from the sea.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: They can
come from the sea,

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and they can come from
animals from the sea.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of different
ways of getting squalene.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not well-versed in a
lot of the negative effects

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.090 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of the other
types of squalene.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
squalene we use is

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.460 align:middle line:84%
highly effective for
building collagen.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:07.439 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:07.439 --> 00:33:11.222 align:middle line:84%
And that product is-- I think
it has white tea extract in it?

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: It has
white tea extract,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:84%
which gives us a very
concentrated amount

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:15.967 align:middle line:90%
of antioxidants.

00:33:15.967 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you had to
put your eye cream

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:26.330 align:middle line:84%
against $150 little one-ounce
jar of it from any company

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
that we won't
mention the name of,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.940 align:middle line:84%
from France or
from anywhere, how

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:84%
would you say it stacks
up by way of results?

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, we would
win, and you'd owe me $100.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.355 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:33:36.355 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it's $100 less
than $150 eye cream.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.726 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
really is as effective?

00:33:40.726 --> 00:33:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: It works.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we make
can outperform everything

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:90%
that's on the cosmetic counter.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a tall statement.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.864 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, I make it every
day, and I stand behind it.

00:33:50.864 --> 00:33:52.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
great things about Pangea

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:90%
is we have a 0.7% return rate.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:84%
That means out of 100 products
that we sell, less than one

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:00.740 align:middle line:90%
of them is returned.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we really stand behind
everything that we make.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:84%
When people say, does
this really work?

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say, do you
really use your products?

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Of course I use them.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.475 align:middle line:90%
And when I--

00:34:09.475 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're 75, and my
god, no one would believe it.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Except
for the gray hairs

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.510 align:middle line:90%
that are coming in on the side.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.010 align:middle line:84%
When I started
Pangea, I said, look.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.564 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to put
anything out onto the market

00:34:20.564 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:84%
just to put a product
out on the market.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:84%
It has to outperform what
people are used to buying.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're going
to change people's habits

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and get them away
from toxins, we

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.060 align:middle line:84%
need to show them that
plants are powerful

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and they can outperform
what they were using.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a Walgreens
product or product from Sephora,

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:84%
we will go head-to-head against
every product on the market.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean, I
take this is more anecdotal

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.340 align:middle line:84%
because people have
tried different things

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and you have a very
low return rate

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:50.752 align:middle line:90%
compared to other companies.

00:34:50.752 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I assume compared to
commercial companies

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:90%
that's a very low return rate?

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Extremely low.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I've been told in
the cosmetic industry

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:84%
it's anywhere from 5%
to 10% is the average.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
try that eye cream.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.929 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: I want
you to try it, too.

00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:90%
So what about sulfates?

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.000 align:middle line:90%
What are sulfates?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Sulfates--
you know, obviously we

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:11.430 align:middle line:90%
don't use any sulfates.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But the hot word in the market
is sodium lauryl sulfate,

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.625 align:middle line:90%
or sodium laureth sulfate.

00:35:18.625 --> 00:35:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're skin irritants
more than anything.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were created,
as we were talking about,

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.060 align:middle line:90%
in the 1950s to replace soap.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So basically it's an
irritant, not necessarily

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:84%
a carcinogen, just
more of an irritant?

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Not always,
but sometimes it

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:84%
can be, just depending
on how it's formulated.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sometimes?

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:90%
What about hyaluronic acid?

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:40.549 align:middle line:84%
That's another big one in the
upper end lines of skin care.

00:35:40.549 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Again, it's
the same as squalene.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.822 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of different
ways to get hyaluronic acid.

00:35:44.822 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.620 align:middle line:90%
So some may not be bad?

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Some may not be
bad, and oftentimes it's not.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally
just an acid that

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.160 align:middle line:84%
helps attract moisture
to the skin cells.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And would the same
be true for glycolic acid?

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Mmm, it's
a little bit more

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:84%
of a slippery slope when
you get to glycolic acid.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's talk about it.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, I think
glycolic acid can thin the skin.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's
always a good move for people

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to make to use different types
of acids that are stripping

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:90%
away layers of the skin.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Because as their skin thins
out, guess what happens to it?

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.710 align:middle line:90%
It ages.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's giving us this
immediate desired effect,

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:84%
but my personal opinion
over the long term

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.130 align:middle line:84%
is it's thinning the
skin out too much.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And also consumers
get an acid, and they

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:84%
don't know the proper
way of using it.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about just more
natural fruit-based acids?

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.140 align:middle line:84%
What is a good example
of that, an ingredient

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.380 align:middle line:90%
that we might recognize?

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.791 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, there's two ways
of getting enzymatic or fruit

00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:90%
acids.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:84%
There's buying a
naturally occurring one.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you were using
a citrus oil in your product.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.817 align:middle line:84%
But then there's also
buying an active component.

00:36:57.817 --> 00:36:59.400 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
actives earlier,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.610 align:middle line:84%
where there's a company making
a isolated acid from a fruit.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't seen anything
terribly wrong with them,

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.890 align:middle line:84%
but I've also seen people burn
their skin on fruit acids.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So if the brand is using too
much of that acid and it's not

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:84%
being regulated--
and with fruit acids,

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.100 align:middle line:84%
it's a very difficult
to regulate it

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.572 align:middle line:90%
because it's a fruit.

00:37:20.572 --> 00:37:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And when things come out of
the ground, they're snowflakes.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not regulated the
way they are in a lab.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're really
hell-bent on using acids,

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.565 align:middle line:84%
I would use fruit
over synthentic.

00:37:32.565 --> 00:37:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:39.997 align:middle line:84%
I learned about citrus the
hard way one time, using--

00:37:39.997 --> 00:37:42.288 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Did you put lemon
oil on your skin and go out

00:37:42.288 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:90%
in the sun?

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.517 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I put lemon
and orange oil in a hot bath.

00:37:47.517 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Ahh.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And apparently
I put too many drops in.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Too much.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And whatever that
species of baboon with red

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:90%
butts--

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Ahh!

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I literally
had to call--

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten who I
called and said, how do I

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:90%
stop the burning and the pain?

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.904 align:middle line:90%
And they said rub olive oil on.

00:38:04.904 --> 00:38:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think I must have called
the person I bought it from

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And then just rub
olive oil on the skin,

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and then that takes all
of the sting and the burn

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.790 align:middle line:90%
and the active ingredients away.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.169 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:38:16.169 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times
people underestimate

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:90%
the power of nature.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.805 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you put lemon
essential oil on your face

00:38:21.805 --> 00:38:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and walked out in the sun,
it could burn you for life.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It's terrible.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: It's very important
to know what you're doing.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And I do encourage DIY
people all the time.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Like, look.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.200 align:middle line:84%
If you want to make products
at home, you should go for it.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our best selling
product is our mask.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It's an acai goji berry mask.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
the green one.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:39.945 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:38:39.945 --> 00:38:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And I actually made
a video on YouTube,

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.414 align:middle line:84%
took people into Whole
Foods with a camera crew,

00:38:46.414 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:84%
showed people how to buy all
of the ingredients to make it

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.376 align:middle line:90%
and how to make it at home.

00:38:50.376 --> 00:38:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the caveat
is by the time

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.374 align:middle line:84%
you're done buying
all the ingredients,

00:38:53.374 --> 00:38:54.984 align:middle line:84%
it's about 160
bucks, whereas you

00:38:54.984 --> 00:38:56.275 align:middle line:90%
can buy our mask for about $40.

00:38:56.275 --> 00:38:57.608 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what's in the mask?

00:38:57.608 --> 00:39:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: So it's acai, which
is a berry from the Amazon.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:90%
It's goji berries.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.290 align:middle line:84%
There's two types of French
white and green clay.

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.644 align:middle line:84%
There's two types of
hand-harvested seaweed.

00:39:07.644 --> 00:39:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And for you viewers
that are interested,

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.890 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
YouTube the video

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.720 align:middle line:84%
where I take people
to the ocean.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It's in the Pacific Ocean,
Northern California where

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:90%
we hand-harvest the seaweeds.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
main ingredients.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And what it is is a superfood
smoothie for your face.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
is the resultant effect?

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: So, it's a mask that's
kind of a Jack of all trades.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And so it's detoxifying.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It's pulling impurities
out of the skin.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It's pumping a massive amount
of antioxidants into your skin.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I will guarantee you
that if you use that mask

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.397 align:middle line:84%
and you go out, people
will comment on your skin.

00:39:42.397 --> 00:39:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.444 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Every single time.

00:39:44.444 --> 00:39:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How often do you
recommend people do that?

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: I use it once a week.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.515 align:middle line:84%
Glass of wine, dark chocolate,
mud mask, 45 minutes.

00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All antioxidants.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: All antioxidants.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you said,
it starts on the inside.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:56.909 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Exactly.

00:39:56.909 --> 00:39:58.800 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do both.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's talk
about hair for a little bit.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.479 align:middle line:84%
You weren't making hair
products, but now you are?

00:40:04.479 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: We're going to
be launching a hair care

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.119 align:middle line:90%
line at the end of the summer.

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what's
different about your line

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.772 align:middle line:84%
and using organics in
the hair and the effect

00:40:13.772 --> 00:40:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and then I want
to talk to you about an Edgar

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:18.137 align:middle line:90%
Cayce thing.

00:40:18.137 --> 00:40:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: So, the hair's
really interesting.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:90%
So your hair is dead.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So for the past 14 years,
I've been formulating products

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.070 align:middle line:84%
for your skin, which is
this living organism.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And so with the hair,
because it's dead,

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
you're actually just trying
to figure out a way to--

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make it
look alive again.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Well, sort of.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's organically
pulling the dirt and oil off

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.155 align:middle line:84%
of the hair while leaving
a lot of beneficial oils

00:40:40.155 --> 00:40:41.980 align:middle line:84%
that your body
naturally creates,

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and then a conditioner
that helps flatten

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.880 align:middle line:84%
the hair in a way that
gives it body and shine,

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.555 align:middle line:84%
and, like you were saying, life
that it doesn't actually have.

00:40:50.555 --> 00:40:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
appearance of life.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: The
appearance of life.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
this is the holy grail

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:90%
of the organic industry.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:02.380 align:middle line:84%
No one's been able to
create an organic hair care

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.570 align:middle line:90%
line that works.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: And it's because
over the past 50 years,

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:11.611 align:middle line:84%
it is, by far, the
most toxic industry.

00:41:11.611 --> 00:41:15.860 align:middle line:84%
The ingredients that are in
a lot of these salon brands

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:90%
is just astronomical.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And people often say,
well, it's my hair.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to my body.

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.894 align:middle line:84%
But the pores at the end of your
follicles are actually huge.

00:41:25.894 --> 00:41:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you use
hair care, you're

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:90%
putting it on your hands.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.276 align:middle line:90%
It's running down your face.

00:41:29.276 --> 00:41:30.590 align:middle line:90%
It's going on your body.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So it is getting
absorbed into your body

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
probably more than
anything else you're using.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.192 align:middle line:84%
And so I've spent the
last four and a half years

00:41:38.192 --> 00:41:40.400 align:middle line:84%
working with our team to
develop this hair care line,

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.279 align:middle line:84%
so I'm pretty
excited to launch it.

00:41:42.279 --> 00:41:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So obviously you
already have the tests.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:90%
The tests have been done.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.127 align:middle line:84%
Have you started sampling
it out to people?

00:41:50.127 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Just friends
and family right now.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.584 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:52.584 --> 00:41:53.530 align:middle line:90%
And what are the--

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.546 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Everyone
loves it, of course.

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it give that same
kind of lightness and light

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:90%
and shine to the hair that--

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: The stylists that
I've known for years that work

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:84%
at salons, who swore that
natural would never be

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:08.470 align:middle line:90%
the thing--

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You could never do it.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: They're like,
we'll use your skin care.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.841 align:middle line:90%
Natural hair care doesn't work.

00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:13.492 align:middle line:90%
I've sent it to them.

00:42:13.492 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They like it?

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: They thought
that I put some fancy brand

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:17.650 align:middle line:90%
in a bottle and sent it to them.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you know,
what's really nice about that

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.652 align:middle line:84%
is the people that are in
that industry-- I mean,

00:42:21.652 --> 00:42:23.360 align:middle line:84%
unless they're using
gloves all the time,

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.400 align:middle line:84%
they're being exposed to
these things all day long.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.858 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Same
thing-- nail salons.

00:42:26.858 --> 00:42:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, I mean,
the person that I've

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:84%
gone to for my hair for years
has had this constant problem

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.560 align:middle line:84%
with red peeling
skin on the hands.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:84%
They finally had to
start using gloves.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But imagine what they've been
exposed to all of this time.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So that sounds like
it's a really-- that's

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.600 align:middle line:90%
a real boon for them.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Is it expensive, though?

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Not compared to a
lot of these salon brands.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your company
is on the rise.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.230 align:middle line:90%
You're doing really well.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I haven't tried your
products yet, but now I will.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.930 align:middle line:90%
It sounds interesting.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.550 align:middle line:84%
You said there
about 10 companies

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:04.710 align:middle line:84%
that are doing good work out
there in the organic skin care

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:05.680 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.259 align:middle line:84%
Who are some of those other
companies besides yours?

00:43:08.259 --> 00:43:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I assume
you all kind of have

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.660 align:middle line:90%
to grow this industry together.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bronner's-- I've been
friends with the grandsons that

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:19.490 align:middle line:84%
now run Dr. Bronner's, and they
are completely legitimate from

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:20.265 align:middle line:90%
the ground up.

00:43:20.265 --> 00:43:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's, I think,
a little documentary on them.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a really wonderful company.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.773 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Well, it's
their grandfather

00:43:24.773 --> 00:43:25.780 align:middle line:90%
who was Dr. Bronner.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And let's see, Badger
Balm is another one.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.142 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
for a long time.

00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are
the two that come

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to mind that are really out
there and speaking the truth

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and putting great ingredients
in their products.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.928 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All you have to do
is read a Dr. Bronner's bottle

00:43:40.928 --> 00:43:44.397 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see the truth, the
philosophy of the company.

00:43:44.397 --> 00:43:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: But they're putting
truth out to the consumer.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: And consumers
deserve to know what they're

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.220 align:middle line:84%
putting on their body, and
to understand that if they're

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.250 align:middle line:84%
making a good decision
or a bad decision.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Because it's our health.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: Next to time, it's
the most important thing

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:90%
that we were gifted as humans.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what are
you doing-- are you

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.270 align:middle line:84%
collaborating with other
organic-type companies,

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.660 align:middle line:84%
even if it's not
necessarily skin care,

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.670 align:middle line:84%
to start growing the
awareness and start growing

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:13.379 align:middle line:90%
your own company?

00:44:13.379 --> 00:44:14.003 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Yeah.

00:44:14.003 --> 00:44:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm good friends
a lot of founders

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:17.990 align:middle line:90%
of some great organic companies.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Guayaki Yerba Mate--
we're good friends.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And Sambazon, the acai
company-- amazing company.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Big Tree Farms, which is
another amazing company that

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.935 align:middle line:90%
imports a lot of organic foods.

00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:37.070 align:middle line:84%
The organic industry is
great, because anybody

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.364 align:middle line:84%
who's legitimate about the
way they're doing business

00:44:39.364 --> 00:44:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
providing to the world,

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.614 align:middle line:84%
we always end up in
the same circles,

00:44:42.614 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and we're always wanting
to support each other

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.430 align:middle line:84%
because we're from
the same tribe.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
do you do-- I mean,

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:51.050 align:middle line:84%
is it all social networking
type of marketing,

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:52.390 align:middle line:90%
or how do you market together?

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.431 align:middle line:10%
>>ONYSKO: Well, Pangea is
a direct sales company.

00:44:54.431 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:10%
So we sell from us
to beauty ecologists,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.610 align:middle line:10%
and the beauty ecologist
sells to the consumers.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.060 align:middle line:90%
We've been around for 14 years.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.500 align:middle line:84%
We also sell in 17
other countries.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty easy to go online
and find reviews on products

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and get testimonials on
products and order right online.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when will
the hair line be out?

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: I don't have
a specific date yet.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've been saying
that for what, a year or so?

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:19.243 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: Very soon.

00:45:19.243 --> 00:45:20.120 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:20.620 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:21.245 align:middle line:90%
It's difficult.

00:45:21.245 --> 00:45:22.810 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be perfect, right?

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so right now we're
just fine-tuning the scents

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:25.640 align:middle line:90%
on the product.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe in
the next six months

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.060 align:middle line:84%
or so we might see
it on the market?

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:28.896 align:middle line:10%
>>ONYSKO: I would
say almost definitely

00:45:28.896 --> 00:45:30.181 align:middle line:10%
in the next six months.

00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:31.180 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, very good.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:31.680 align:middle line:10%
Well--

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.504 align:middle line:10%
>>ONYSKO: Don't wash until then.

00:45:33.504 --> 00:45:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:34.669 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:34.669 --> 00:45:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for that
bit of advice.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:38.604 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
for all the information.

00:45:38.604 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ONYSKO: My pleasure.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
elucidating, actually.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I like
lipstick, and I like I

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:45.560 align:middle line:90%
like things like that.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, there are certain
things that, as a woman,

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I probably would still go for.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But the whole notion of
using food-oriented nutrients

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.792 align:middle line:90%
on your face only makes sense.

00:45:56.792 --> 00:45:58.750 align:middle line:84%
If we're taking the time
and spending the money

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to do that on our bodies, and
for the inside of our bodies,

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.119 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense to do
it on the outside too.

00:46:04.119 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ONYSKO: And thank
you for taking the time

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to bring the truth
to your viewers.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Most welcome.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, a lot of good info.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:14.460 align:middle line:10%
Can't wait to try that tea
extract for the eye area.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.400 align:middle line:10%
