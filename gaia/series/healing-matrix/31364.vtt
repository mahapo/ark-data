00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.345 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:10%
If you're like me, you're tired
of hearing how we should take

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:10%
this supplement or
that supplement,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.290 align:middle line:10%
and we've likely
taken dozens of them

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:10%
with no noticeable effects.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:10%
That said, sometimes we do
need to back up and reappraise

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:10%
the situation because
there are things that

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:10%
do make a difference-- if taken
correctly and in high quality

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:10%
form.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I was in Austin,
Texas recently, where

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with Mike Adams, also
known as the Health Ranger.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:10%
We spoke about a
couple of must-haves

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:10%
for essential good health--
aloe vera and microalgaes.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:10%
Well here we are again,
and this time we're really

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:10%
going to focus on
nutrients themselves,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.051 align:middle line:10%
and I have to thank you for that
last conversation-- I loved it.

00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I loved it too.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:10%
We got into the higher
components of why it's good

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:10%
not to have your brain and
your master glands blocked off

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:10%
from your true self.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:10%
And so anybody who hasn't
seen that one, definitely

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:10%
take a look at part one.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:10%
Now today, I want to
talk about aloe vera.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we're talking
about some simple elements

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:10%
but it wasn't until I read
your eBook on your site

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:10%
that I realized the incredible
importance of aloe vera.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:10%
I just thought of it as
something like-- slippery,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:10%
more or less-- that is really
good for lubricating the guts,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:10%
primarily.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:10%
Which is how I think
most people know it.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:10%
MIKE ADAMS: It is, yeah.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.423 align:middle line:10%
There's a whole
different story though.

00:01:42.423 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:10%
There's much more than that.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:10%
So let's launch into aloe
vera, the story of aloe vera.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK, wow.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's my favorite
medicinal plant,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and it's an edible plant.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I have
a video out there

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:10%
that shows how you can
fillet the aloe vera leaf

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:10%
and eat the inner gel.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to
eat the actual leaf.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.790 align:middle line:10%
You would be
chewing a long time.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:10%
And you don't want to
see the dark resins that

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:10%
actually flow through
capillaries that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:10%
are just underneath the skin.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:90%
That will give you diarrhea.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want
to mess with that.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're very
careful in this video

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
about how to filet it so you're
getting only the useful parts.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Now what's amazing
about the gel is

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
it's a great example
of nature developing

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:90%
phenomenal nanotechnology.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:10%
The function of the gel
within the aloe vera plant--

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:10%
it's multifaceted,
and these all have

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:10%
applications in human health.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:10%
But number one,
the main function

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:10%
is to store water in a
super efficient format that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:10%
can grow and shrink as
the environmental water is

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:10%
available or not.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Aloe vera survives through
droughts quite effectively.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But the other function--
and by the way,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
this has enormous
benefits in human health.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Not just for hydration,
but also for blood flow,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:90%
as we'll talk about.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, it serves
as a natural bandage--

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
a Band-Aid-- a healing
element when the aloe vera

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:90%
plant is cut or broken off.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you break
an aloe vera plant

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice a
couple things happen.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Now first of all, the gel
right there traps any bacteria

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:90%
that might try to get into it.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And as people are
listening to this,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
they might be imagining
putting this on a wound.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:10%
And it has the same function
on their own wound--

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:10%
As Neosporin or
something like that.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.355 align:middle line:84%
Better, way better than
Neosporin or anything

00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is once the
aloe vera gel begins to dry,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:90%
it contracts.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And it contracts
something like a hundred

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
times its original size
when it was hydrated.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
It contracts down
to 1/100 of its size

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
yet the actual molecular
links remain intact.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:90%
So like-- is it closing up?

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:10%
It's closing the wound, yes.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you actually put
aloe vera gel on a wound--

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.105 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying this is a
replacement if you get stabbed

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
or something in Chicago,
you probably want

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:90%
to go to the emergency room.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.601 align:middle line:84%
But I live on a farm and I get
cuts and scrapes and things

00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I probably got scrapes
all over me from--

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I see a couple
little cuts, yeah.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And any time something like
that happens, even if I get

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:84%
a serious wound and if I plan to
go to the hospital or emergency

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.081 align:middle line:84%
room-- because the emergency
room has a function, let's

00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
be honest.
I'm not against emergency rooms.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:10%
Anything to mend up
trauma, absolutely.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But I would put aloe
on it first and then

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:90%
go to the emergency room.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the aloe is going to
stop the infection immediately.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And as it dries, it's going to
start to close up the wound.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And I've even used
our vera internally.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So, if I had a
wound that was deep,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I would put the
aloe vera inside.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I got to say as a
disclaimer-- I'm not a doctor

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not giving
people medical advice.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you research
it, aloe vera

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
is a powerful antibacterial.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Powerful even as an anti-viral.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So it has all kinds of functions
in wounds and first-aid.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:10%
And for those out there who
might be thinking about-- I

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:10%
don't know, survival scenarios,
or personal preparedness,

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:10%
or living off the grid, or
maybe even doing volunteer work

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:10%
in a developing nation
where there is no medicine--

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:10%
this is medicine
that you can grow

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:10%
and you can carry with you.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
You could tear off
a leaf of aloe--

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
it'll last for weeks
in your pocket.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like carrying around a
first-aid kit in your pocket.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
It remains plump and hydrated.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:10%
Yes, yes.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It will hold-- that
gel will hold water

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:90%
for months in your pocket.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Or in your closet or whatever.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But now, that's just
the external use

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:90%
that we've talked about so far.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Internal use is really
also very powerful.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:10%
And this is where I've done
quite a bit of research.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm not the world's
expert on aloe vera

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:10%
but I've eaten a lot aloe.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:10%
You eat it every day, right?

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, not right now
because I moved and I'm

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:10%
having to regrow my aloe.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Right, because weren't
you in Arizona when you

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.224 align:middle line:90%
were growing your aloe and--

00:06:07.224 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
-Yes, I was in Arizona.
-Yeah.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And we're in Arizona.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:90%
It's all around, I love it.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, last year I
planted about 400

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:90%
aloe vera plants in my own--

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:90%
In Texas, outside of Austin.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes, in Texas.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So I've got my aloe
nursery and I think

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.280 align:middle line:84%
in another month I'll be
able to start harvesting

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.095 align:middle line:90%
those and drinking the gel.

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:10%
Oh, OK.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, while we're on
the subject, a person

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.100 align:middle line:10%
can grow it in a pot anywhere.
-Absolutely.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:10%
You can have it in your
backyard, in your patio,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:10%
in a pot, a couple pots.
OK.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:10%
And even in a northern climate,
you just bring them inside

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:10%
in the winter and it's fine.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to say anybody
can grow their own aloe.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.962 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can grow aloe.

00:06:41.962 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, you don't
have to pay patent royalties

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:10%
to mother nature because she
gives you everything for free,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:10%
unlike the drug companies.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.310 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
contact the US Patent

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%

to have permission

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:90%
to replicate aloe vera.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Go figure, growing your own
medicine-- royalty free.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.097 align:middle line:84%
So, internally, this is
where it's really amazing.

00:07:07.097 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of
research done on this

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and-- I'm talking about
just about the gel.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, those of you
out there watching this who

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:10%
may have consumed an aloe vera
drink from a health food store,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:10%
you probably noticed it
tasted kind of weird.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:90%
They taste funny.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
pasteurized, some of them

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:84%
are preserved with sodium
benzoate-- which is something

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:90%
that I wouldn't recommend.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I never consume aloe vera
drinks or gels that are sold

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:90%
 --As supplements?

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.936 align:middle line:90%
As packaged, no.

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:90%
They taste weird to me.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
actually mostly water.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I've seen aloe vera formulas
sold at health food stores that

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
are maybe 10% aloe vera gel,
90% water that's thickened

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
with caraageenan--
the seaweed extract

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that some questions
are being raised

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:90%
right now for digestive issues.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.651 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend growing
your aloe and harvesting it

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.350 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very easy
and when you do that,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:84%
the gel tastes
basically neutral.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no weird taste.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:10%
I drank a smoothie every day for
breakfast-- you saw my smoothie

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:10%
earlier that I brought in.
-Green.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:10%
Very green.
-That's the green one.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in the afternoon
I'll drink a fruit smoothie.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And aloe vera slips quietly and
easily with full compatibility

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:84%
into a green smoothie--
which I do with avocados

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and cacao and a banana.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:90%
Love that.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Or a fruit smoothie.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I do freeze dried or
frozen organic blueberries,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
strawberries, mango--
all kinds of things.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And I put in superfood
powders in both of those

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to really boost
up the nutrition.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you put aloe vera gel--
and I mean the gel is solid.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not a liquid.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
When you fillet that leaf,
you can hold up the gel.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- what does it
have the consistency of?

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Almost like a wet sponge.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's clear, you
can see through it.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:10%
It's translucent.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:10%
Like a jelly.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:10%
Yes, like a jelly,
but it's intact.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can take that--
or I should say partially

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
translucent-- you can take
that, or you can put it

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
into your fruit smoothie or any
other smoothie, blend it in,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.140 align:middle line:90%
and you won't even taste it.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, I like to say
don't blend it too

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
much because the polysaccharides
in the aloe vera-- I

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
think they might be
destroyed by over blending.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.441 align:middle line:84%
OK, so add that more toward
the end of the blending cycle.

00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.490 align:middle line:10%
-Toward the end.
-OK.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:10%
And I like to get just the aloe
vera in sort of small chunks

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:10%
left in the smoothie.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:10%
So when I'm drinking them,
they're little sort of corn

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:10%
kernel sized chunks of aloe
vera, and you can chew on them

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.820 align:middle line:10%
and then when you digest
them, everything's intact.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Now what this does
is truly amazing.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
There was research on aloe
vera done by the US military

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.700 align:middle line:84%
for treating traumatic
blood loss in the field.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And most soldiers who die of
wounds die from the blood loss,

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's basic physics.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not the tissue damage.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's say a soldier-- god
forbid-- gets a leg blown off.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.100 align:middle line:84%
They can survive
without the leg.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
What's killing them is that
the femoral artery is losing

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:90%
blood at a horrifying rate.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:90%
They bleed out and die.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:84%
This is true in car accidents
or shootings or war.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
The military found
out that if you take

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:84%
an extract of aloe vera and
you inject it into soldiers who

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:84%
were losing fatal
amounts of blood,

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:84%
that the aloe vera would allow
their remaining blood to carry

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:84%
more oxygen. So that-- and
again, it's lack of oxygen

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%
that ultimately kills a person.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
You lose consciousness because
of lack of oxygen to the brain.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Your organs shut down because
of lack of oxygen to the organs.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So the blood, if it
could carry more oxygen,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
it can keep you alive
longer-- or allow

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
you to live beyond the
threshold at which you

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:90%
would normally die.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, this research showed
that it enhanced the oxygen

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:90%
carrying capacity of blood.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Now the military
hasn't done anything

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
with that because--
I don't know,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
they don't like good ideas
sometimes, it seems like.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, they initiated it.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting
it was even initiated

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's certainly gives
some data to work with.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about how could
this help people who are not

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:84%
in the military, and
who are not suffering

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:84%
traumatic blood
loss-- how many people

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:90%
suffer from hypoxia right now?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:10%
They have low oxygenation
of their blood,

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:10%
they have the
cognitive confusion,

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:10%
they're not getting ample
oxygen supply of the brain.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:10%
Now this is really important
because we're now-- officially,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:10%
we're on an oxygen
deprived planet

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:10%
for the optimal functioning.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, our immune systems are
totally dependent on oxygen.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
designed to have

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
more oxygen circulating
in our blood

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
then what we're
actually getting.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
organ dysfunction,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
there are many,
many causes of it.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
We talked about metals
in the last segment

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
which can cause kidney damage
and liver damage and so on.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But a lack of oxygen
basically impairs-- hampers

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:84%
the functioning of all organs,
but especially the brain

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
because it uses more oxygen
than any other single organ

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.685 align:middle line:84%
Now also as anaerobic
bacteria-- it

00:12:40.685 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
likes to grow in an environment
that has no oxygen-- that's

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:90%
by definition.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells love environments
that have no oxygen.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So you see people
out there doing

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:90%
ozone therapy for example, O3.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
You see people out there doing--
some people even doing hydrogen

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:90%
peroxide type of therapies.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Drinking small amounts of
the hydrogen peroxide-- H2O2,

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe, and allowing that to
circulate through their bodies.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Some people are doing, in
fact, a breathing therapy

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to hyperventilate and increase
oxygenation of cells, which is

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:90%
a valid and valuable therapy.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:10%
It's valid but still, if you
don't enough in the environment

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:10%
itself, you can still only
saturate to a certain degree.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:10%
That's true, that's true.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat aloe vera--
now this is my theory.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been able to
scientifically prove this,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
but my theory is, if
you eat aloe vera,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:84%
you are increasing the oxygen
carrying capacity of your blood

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
so every heart beat you're
getting maybe 20% more oxygen

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:90%
to your cells.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's only 5%, I don't
know the answer, but it's more.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know this because I
used to train not too long

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:90%
ago when I was in Arizona.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I used to train in the
hand to hand combat

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%
and personal self defense.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I trained in the system
called Krav Maga,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and we even did
crazy exotic things

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:84%
like defense against knives
and defense against handguns.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of--

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.210 align:middle line:90%
You got into it, yeah.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Valuable skills for
their own reasons.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But I was there-- I
was in my late '30s

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and I was training
with guys that were 19,

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and I was out cardio
performing those guys when

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:90%
I was almost twice their age.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I could last longer,
I could do more.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was drinking the
aloe vera every day

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:90%
because I was growing it.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:90%
You were growing it, right.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I did aloe vera
and astaxanthin.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two things that
I had in my diet at that time

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that I credit with allowing me
to have this really remarkable

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:90%
cardiovascular endurance.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:10%
And like I said, I'm
growing more aloe now--

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:10%
So your immune system must have
been in really high gear, too.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:10%
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:10%
I've only been sick really
one time in the last decade

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:10%
from like a flu type of thing.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And even then, it
didn't knock me out.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Just had to sleep more.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But I-- and I don't take
vaccines, you know that.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't for
more than a decade.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Probably 20 years.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
But I rarely get sick, and
I often go into areas where

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.900 align:middle line:90%
there is high risk of disease.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, I flew into
Taiwan during the SARS outbreak

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
when you got off the
plane and they aimed

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:90%
a thermal gun at your head--

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:84%
-What year was this?
-I don't remember--

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:90%
A few years ago?

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:90%
It was a few years ago.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:90%
We can look it up.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:10%
We went to Japan and then
they walked on to the plane

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:10%
and started putting
masks-- handing

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:10%
masks to each one of us.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:10%
The odd thing is, as soon
as we walked off the plane,

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:10%
everybody just took them off
and threw them in the garbage.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:10%
They only cared that they
looked good for the cameras.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.139 align:middle line:10%
Interesting.
-That's funny.

00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Taiwan, they
had the medical personnel

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
there with the thermal
cameras and then

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
they had you up on a big screen
with your thermal footprint

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:90%
showing how hot you were.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they had military
personnel ready to take you

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:90%
into quarantine.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Don't cough here, you're
going to quarantine.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't get sick, you know.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I went in and out of Taiwan,
I interact with people.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:90%
I just I rarely get sick.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think there are a number
of reasons beyond aloe vera--

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean you do a
lot of other things,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
but just getting back to
the only-- to the component

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:90%
of oxygen carrying capacity.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I think that
aloe vera in addition

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:84%
to the oxygen carrying
capacity, it also allows

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%
your blood to be less viscous.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So your blood flows
more easily because--

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
-Talk about sticky blood.
-Perfect.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:90%
I call it sludge blood.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And people have sticky
blood because of their diet.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:90%
And also because of dehydration.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:84%
People hate to drink water
because the water's fluoridated

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and it tastes terrible and
it's city water or tap water.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
trained to drink

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
soda and pasteurized fruit
juice and homogenized milk.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
They've been trained not
to drink water to the point

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.735 align:middle line:84%
where many people don't
quote, "like" water.

00:17:01.735 --> 00:17:03.126 align:middle line:90%
How can you not like water?

00:17:03.126 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:90%
You're like 75% water.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.101 align:middle line:84%
You are water, what
are you talking about?

00:17:08.101 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:10%
This is true, but mostly
it tastes terrible.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:10%
And then they've read about the
problem with the contamination

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.900 align:middle line:10%
from the plastic
bottles and storage

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:10%
in the trucks and
stores and so forth,

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:10%
so you can see
there's a lot of--

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:10%
I can see that.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.530 align:middle line:10%
So by the way, the
solution to that

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:10%
is to set up a rainwater
collection system

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.811 align:middle line:10%
and drink rainwater, which I've
been doing for a couple years

00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:10%
now.
It's just amazing.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:10%
It's like-- day and night.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:10%
We were-- Scott was
talking about doing

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:10%
that at this new place.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:10%
That's a good idea
during monsoon season.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.160 align:middle line:10%
It's also the pH-- I'm going
to get off on a tangent here,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:10%
but the pH of rainwater is much
lower than typical city water--

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle line:10%
lower meaning it's
slightly more acidic.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Now I think one of the
things that happens--

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and Ed Group is an
expert on this subject,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
but when you drink heavily
mineralized water year

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
after year after
year, what you get

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:84%
is a mineral buildup
throughout your body.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Your bladder and
kidneys in particular.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But also, those minerals
can build up in your joints

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and becomes symptoms
of arthritis.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But you get an overall
calcification of tissues,

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:90%
including your heart tissues.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Every tissue in your body
can become calcified.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:10%
If you switch to
rainwater, you start

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:10%
to dissolve that
calcification because now

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:10%
you're running about a 6.4
pH which is slightly acidic.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that typical
city water is normally

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:90%
in the 7.0 and up range.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:10%
See, now most people
talk about alkalinity,

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.359 align:middle line:10%
that's a good thing.
I mean--

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:10%
Ah, it's a complex subject.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go into that subject--
let's finish up on aloe vera,

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and then you want to dive into
alkalinity and alkalized water?

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, excellent.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But by the way, just
a side note-- plants,

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:90%
they don't want alkaline water.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:90%
They want the 6.4 pH.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
The 6.7, maybe 6.8--
the upper range.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:10%
I was interviewing Michael
Murphy recently and all

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:10%
of the experiments
out of Hawaii,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:10%
where the chemtrails
are starting

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:10%
to create more
alkaline environment

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:10%
for the plant growth.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:10%
A lot of crops are dying and it
is because of the alkalinity.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:10%
I mean aside from
the fact that they

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:10%
have aluminum and
barium dumped on them,

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:10%
but it's the alkalinity.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:10%
We have to be very
careful when we talk

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:10%
about alkalizing your diet.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, we'll get to that.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But back to the blood,
so-- sludge blood

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:84%
is caused by
dehydration and normally

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.275 align:middle line:84%
the consumption of
really unhealthy trans

00:19:20.275 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
fats, or partially
hydrogenated oils.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So vegetable shortening
is the classic case

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:90%
of where that comes from.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
-Which is in everything.
-I know.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.690 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:84%
If you're out there
eating-- I don't know,

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
pastries or birthday
cakes or icing or anything

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:84%
like that, you're getting
hydrogenated oils.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've completely eliminated
hydrogenated anything out

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:90%
of my diet.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:45.071 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can't remember ever
eating that in recent memory

00:19:45.071 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
because I read.
I read all the labels.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm like the food geek
at the grocery store.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm the geeky guy.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Like, my god, the man can read!

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:90%
Literacy, it's amazing.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:90%
You should try it sometime.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But people don't
read labels, so.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, if you get
aloe vera into your diet,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
these benefits of aloe

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:90%
into your bloodstream.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Your blood is going
to flow more easily.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Now this has huge implications
for disease prevention.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
It also means people who
suffer from atherosclerosis--

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
hardening of the
arteries for example,

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.790 align:middle line:90%
scarring of the arteries.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
As healthier blood courses
through their arteries

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and veins, it's going to have a
cleansing effect automatically.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Will it start
clearing some of it?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
A slight chelation
effect automatically.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:84%
That's especially true if
you're getting clean water

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and if you have healthy
oils in your diet.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you're adding
omega-3s into your diet

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and drinking rainwater and not
eating the trans fats, then

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:84%
your arteries are going to tend
to clean themselves out more.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
That can be accelerated
with EDTA or other chelation

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:90%
type of agents, sure.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But just living
day to day, you can

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:90%
clean yourself up day to day.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:84%
One of things about
cleansing-- a lot of people

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:84%
think that a cleanse has to
be painful to be effective.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:10%
That's why most people
don't want to do them.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:10%
I've heard stories of people
who say, oh I just finished

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.480 align:middle line:10%
a seven day kidney cleanse.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:90%
I almost died!

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Like, you should rethink that.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.851 align:middle line:84%
I can hardly walk, I can't
think clearly but-- yeah.

00:21:14.851 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:90%
But I feel great!

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, compared to what you just
did, you probably feel great.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Cleansing doesn't
have to be traumatic.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Cleansing should actually be the
way you live every single day.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:10%
So, part of this
would be, then--

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.855 align:middle line:10%
rainwater and aloe vera would be
part of this cleansing process?

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:31.409 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:21:31.409 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it makes much more sense.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:10%
You should be
cleansing at every meal.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a gentle, daily, day to
day routine clean approach

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
to living.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
there are benefits

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:84%
to doing a liver cleanse
purge-- if someone's been raised

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
on junk food and they
have a buildup of all

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:84%
these toxic elements, I
understand there's a benefit

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.293 align:middle line:90%
to liver cleanse in it.

00:21:54.293 --> 00:21:56.880 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Enemas and colon cleanses
and all these things--

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
coffee enema for the
really adventurous.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but make sure
it's not decaf, right?

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Right, or you'll
have to do it again.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But there is a point
beyond which this idea of we

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:84%
always have to cleanse,
cleanse, cleanse.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:10%
It becomes a fad.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.695 align:middle line:10%
It becomes almost
like, my cleanse

00:22:17.695 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:10%
was stronger than your cleanse,
and it's like, come on.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, getting
back to aloe vera,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:10%
you're cleansing yourself
with every heartbeat.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about-- your blood

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is what your physical
body is made of.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Whatever gets into your
blood becomes your tissues.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And your tissues are recycled
and essentially replacing

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:90%
and reformulated constantly.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Especially your skin.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:84%
The lining of your large
intestine, for example,

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:90%
doesn't live very long.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:90%
It's replaced constantly.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And even your blood is
replaced constantly.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Even the neurons in
your nervous system

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:84%
are eventually replaced, even
at an elemental level-- quantum

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:84%
science level,
like Bruce Lipton,

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite
authors, might explain.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
But whatever is in
your blood becomes

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
you, your physical body.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So if your blood is
sludge, your body

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:90%
is going to become sludge-like.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
high blood pressure

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.010 align:middle line:90%
and high blood pressure drugs.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that is the
second most common class

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
of pharmaceuticals that
are prescribed today--

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:90%
blood pressure drugs.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I think number is statin drugs.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So blood pressure drugs work
by artificially turning down

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:90%
your heart power, you might say.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Your heart strength--
the pushing strength.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Or by dilating your blood
vessels-- is another mechanism.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem-- why is
your blood pressure high?

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're
trying to pump sludge

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:90%
around your circulatory system.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like trying to push
molasses through a garden hose.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to
flow like water.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.880 align:middle line:90%
You want your blood to flow.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's got to go through
really tiny capillaries,

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:84%
you know-- molecule sized,
cell sized capillaries

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:90%
all throughout your body.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And people who are specially
suffering from things

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:84%
like diabetic neuropathy,
they have potentially very

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:90%
serious circulation problems.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And typically, they
have sludge blood.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And that-- the number one
cause of amputations in America

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:90%
today is diabetic neuropathy.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you have sludge blood, you
could lose a leg, or both legs.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Or an ankle, or
whatever-- a foot.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
That's a big price to pay
for having sludge blood

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and not be living a
relatively clean lifestyle.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So aloe vera helps
your blood flow

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and if you combine that
with other strategies,

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:84%
like getting healthy oils in
your diet and drinking water

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and getting all that crap soda
and pasteurized, homogenized--

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:90%
don't drink processed milk.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
If you like milk,
drink raw milk.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:90%
It's much better for you.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Tastes better, too.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And it digests
better-- everything.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Get the crap out
of your diet, get

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:90%
the good stuff into your diet.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:10%
You'll change your
blood, which will change

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:10%
your body, which will
change your brain,

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:10%
which will change your life.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:10%
That's the bottom line.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:10%
OK, now on aloe vera-- you
just mentioned diabetes.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:10%
Does it have any effect on
blood sugar in the body per se?

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:10%
Or more just the effect
of the flow of the blood

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:10%
that you're saying
in the neuropathy?

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:10%
I don't consider
aloe vera to be

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.770 align:middle line:10%
something for type 2 diabetes.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I have known-- I know that some
people have said that it may be

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
helpful for blood sugar, but I
think there are so many other

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.615 align:middle line:84%
things that are more powerful
for blood sugar regulations,

00:25:32.615 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
such as negative
threes, chromium, and--

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:90%
So we won't go down that road.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.480 align:middle line:10%
What about the-- as we
started the conversation,

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:10%
healing the guts.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:10%
Leaky gut syndrome,
constipation,

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:10%
and other elimination
issues with aloe vera.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, aloe vera
at a physical level

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
is lubrication for
your digestive tract.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's also a healing-- the way
it heals wounds on the outside,

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
it can also heal scars and
tears and actual wounds

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:90%
in your intestinal lining.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And even in your colon.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So I think people who suffer
from things like colon polyps

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:84%
or colon cancer,
they can benefit--

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and they should really
research this in more detail--

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
but they can really benefit
from having aloe vera

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
flowing through those
organs and touching them

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and helping to heal.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a monk
out of Brazil I believe,

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.715 align:middle line:84%
who has a book called the--
something about the aloe cure.

00:26:27.715 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And in his book, he
lays out a simple recipe

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
which I'll share
right here, that he

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.860 align:middle line:84%
says is the cure for many,
many types of cancers.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And he says he's been guarding
the secret passed down

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.600 align:middle line:90%
generation after generation.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very simple recipe.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:46.590 align:middle line:10%
It is whole aloe vera leaf--
including the resin that we

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:10%
talked about before--
plus the gel, with honey,

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:10%
and a little bit of alcohol.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.010 align:middle line:10%
And you blend it and make it--

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.010 align:middle line:10%
You blend it.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.961 align:middle line:84%
You blend it up and it
makes kind of this--

00:26:59.961 --> 00:27:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Syrupy?

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.375 align:middle line:84%
 --Sludgey type of thing
which I've made and consumed.

00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not my favorite thing
but he swears that this

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.020 align:middle line:90%
cures people of cancer.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's been
tested in a wide population

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:84%
but if you look at all the anti
cancer compounds-- the honey

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:84%
alone, and then the aloe
vera-- and alcohol, I think,

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:84%
just helps drive this in
to the tissues, by the way.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a carrier for it but
it's something to research.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.820 align:middle line:10%
OK, and also cholesterol
and skin health.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:10%
I have-- and inflammation.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:10%
I wrote down all these
miracle things it does.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:10%
Can you get in at least a little
bit to each of those things?

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, definitely.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation, I think we could
do a whole segment on that,

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and we'll show-- but
inflammation is, I think,

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.700 align:middle line:84%
the underlying factor
to all of these

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:90%
chronic degenerative diseases.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And aloe interfaces
how with it?

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, aloe calms
the inflammation

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:90%
in the same way it calms burns.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
It was used for
burns-- burn victims.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if burn
wards used more aloe vera

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.810 align:middle line:84%
they would save more
lives and save more skin.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Literally save more skin.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:10%
Anyone who has had a
sunburn and used fresh

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:10%
from the leaf itself--
aloe vera-- knows this.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:10%
And I think women who want to
really help their complexion--

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:10%
the smart ones are
taking the aloe gel

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:10%
and just smearing that
gel all over their face.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of slimy but it's
not colored or anything,

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84%
it's just clear,
and it feels good.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
nourishes your skin.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It really gets absorbed
and nourishes your skin.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Systemic inflammation is
the disease of our time.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation of the brain
is called Alzheimer's.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation of the pancreas
becomes type 2 diabetes.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation of the
tissues-- cancer.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is usually
is the precursor

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:90%
to all of these diseases.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.594 align:middle line:84%
So anything that can
calm inflammation

00:28:50.594 --> 00:28:51.360 align:middle line:90%
is going to be helpful.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.070 align:middle line:84%
But I would warn viewers
not to look at aloe

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
as an allopathic-- sort
of green, allopathy answer

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:90%
to inflammation.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.180 align:middle line:84%
You need to find out what's
causing the inflammation.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And you need to get
rid of that, which is

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:90%
usually something in your diet.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Almost always-- omega-6
oils, processed milk.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Huge causer of inflammation.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:10%
Talk about omega-6s
for a moment

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.214 align:middle line:10%
because people have heard
a lot about omega-3s

00:29:20.214 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:10%
and when you say
omega, they think,

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.413 align:middle line:10%
oh no, I thought that was good.

00:29:22.413 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:10%
I've seen the blends-- 6, 3, 9.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about 6.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's all about
the ratios, really.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And 6s are over-represented
in much of the food supply.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Especially in things like
soy oil and corn oil,

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
which are the two main
cooking oils that are promoted

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:90%
today because they're cheap.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
corn oil mostly comes

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.250 align:middle line:90%
from genetically modified corn.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting GMO oil
that's high in omega-3-- er, 6s.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And low in 3s.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.410 align:middle line:90%
And so you have an imbalance.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And in that imbalance, you're
going to get inflammation.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's like your car
needs a certain type of fuel

00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:90%
in order to run smoothly.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You put in the wrong fuel,
it's going to have problems.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:84%
You put diesel
into your gas car--

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.650 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to run right.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Same thing in oils in the body.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So you have to bump up
the 3s-- the omega-3s.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Most people need
to bump up the 3s.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I've especially
noticed this among vegans

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and vegetarians, and
I've been a vegan

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and I've been a
vegetarian before.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm not right now.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But I've noticed that the vegan
diet is a diet that requires

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous amount of
nutritional analysis

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and behavioral analysis
to successfully pull off.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people do it successfully
but it's very rare.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Probably more than
90% of vegans are

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:42.560 align:middle line:84%
chronically deficient in certain
nutrients-- most notably B12.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are even
different forms

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:84%
of B12-- cyanocobalamin
versus methylcobalamin-- which

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.070 align:middle line:90%
is another whole conversation.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they might
be deficient in B12

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.770 align:middle line:84%
but then they're
taking cyanocobalamin

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and they're sort of
poisoning themselves

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.880 align:middle line:84%
more with the wrong
form of B12 and then

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.940 align:middle line:90%
things are going wrong.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But the classic sign
I've noticed with vegans

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:84%
is if they have
really chapped lips.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:84%
That is a chronic
deficiency in omega-3s.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of vegans try to
get omega-3s from flax seeds

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.060 align:middle line:84%
but you can only eat
so many flax crackers,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.659 align:middle line:84%
you know what I'm saying?
-Yeah, yeah, I do.

00:31:14.659 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And they don't taste that great.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.780 align:middle line:84%
At some point, you have to get
some other concentrated form

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:90%
of omega-3s.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's see.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:10%
We were going to talk about
alkalized water-- did we did

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.670 align:middle line:10%
we finish off aloe pretty well?
-Yeah, I think so.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:10%
I think so.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:10%
I mean, because just getting
rid of the sticky blood,

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:10%
having your blood flow again.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.310 align:middle line:10%
Having your blood oxygenated.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.490 align:middle line:10%
Being able to go on
and repair damage

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.240 align:middle line:10%
inside the intestines and
colon, maybe leaky gut, even.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.964 align:middle line:10%
Just that alone is a fabulous
statement for to the power of--

00:31:47.964 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:10%
MIKE ADAMS: It's a miracle food.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:10%
It's a medicine.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:10%
I know when I read that,
I thought that's it--

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.130 align:middle line:10%
we're definitely growing
aloe vera again because--

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.630 align:middle line:10%
MIKE ADAMS: It's my
number one plant to grow.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:10%
Number one, uno.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:10%
OK, let's-- and I want
to get to micro greens

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.280 align:middle line:10%
because this is
another thing you do

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.870 align:middle line:10%
a lot of, and for good reason.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:10%
But let's pick up that
thread on alkalization.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:10%
Alkalize, yeah.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.660 align:middle line:10%
OK, so, there's a lot
of confusion on this,

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:15.010 align:middle line:10%
and there's a lot of
misinformation, I believe.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the pH scale--
it's a logarithmic scale.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.485 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of difference
between 6.0 and 7.0--

00:32:21.485 --> 00:32:25.694 align:middle line:84%
ten times difference in
the chemical behavior

00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of the element that
you're talking about,

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.320 align:middle line:84%
so let me just put
that out there first.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.975 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
well, we need alkalize,

00:32:31.975 --> 00:32:34.490 align:middle line:84%
we need to alkalize,
we need to alkalize.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, your blood maintains
a very specific pH

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:90%
range no matter what.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to change
the pH of your blood.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.330 align:middle line:84%
If you did, you
would probably die.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if your pH-- the pH of
your blood changes just 0.2,

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.540 align:middle line:84%
it would so drastically
alter the uptake of nutrients

00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:02.100 align:middle line:84%
into your cells that you would
cellular-y asphyxiate in hours.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how much
alkalizing water you drink,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.430 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to change
the alkalinity of your blood.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
What you're changing is
the way your body creates

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.530 align:middle line:90%
that alkalinity of your blood.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:10%
So it's true that if you have
a highly, highly acidic diet--

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:10%
high in things like sodas,
phosphoric acid-- very acidic,

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.620 align:middle line:10%
then your body is going
to need to balance

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:10%
that out to buffer that
using alkaline minerals

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.630 align:middle line:10%
from your own body.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And the place where it finds
that is your skeletal system.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So for every soda you drink,
your body pulls the matching

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.551 align:middle line:90%
equivalent-- the pH--

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: To deal with
phosphoric acid from the soda.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.820 align:middle line:90%
 --Out of your bones, yeah.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So you drink a soda, your femur
loses 2% of its bone mass.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually across
the board-- your jaw,

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.100 align:middle line:90%
your teeth, everything.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Even your skull
will actually thin

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:90%
out if you drink a lot of soda.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.030 align:middle line:84%
They say, someone
has a thick skull--

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:90%
you never hear a thin skull.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.660 align:middle line:90%
You never hear that.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But the other bad part about
drinking sodas and other highly

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.610 align:middle line:84%
acidic beverages is
that as those minerals

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:84%
are pulled out of
your body, then

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.600 align:middle line:90%
they have to be eliminated.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:84%
And where are they
eliminated through?

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:90%
Kidney and bladder.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:90%
Guess what you get?

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Kidney stones.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.179 align:middle line:84%
Because the minerals end
up lodged in your kidneys.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So people who drink sodas
have a super high rate

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:90%
of kidney stones.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.120 align:middle line:10%
When I think of a couple
people, right off hand-- really

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:10%
poor diets and a lot of sodas.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.610 align:middle line:10%
And what they don't
realize is that those kidney

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.560 align:middle line:10%
stones are made out of what
used to be their bones.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So they might actually
call them kidney bones.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.699 align:middle line:84%
Instead of kidney stones,
they're kidney bones.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
So those people then, of
course, have very fragile bones,

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and they very easily
break their bones,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and then they also
have other problems--

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.480 align:middle line:84%
immune system functions
also closely related to pH.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But now people go out
and they buy alkalizing

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:01.330 align:middle line:90%
machines to alkalize the water.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So they're drinking
alkalizing water.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Well-- but let's think
about this very carefully,

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.740 align:middle line:84%
the stomach is
supposed to be acidic.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.050 align:middle line:10%
That's why it's
called stomach acid.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.650 align:middle line:10%
In fact, those
alkalizing machines,

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.750 align:middle line:10%
it'll tell you if you have some
kind of invasion-- bacteria

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.930 align:middle line:10%
or virus of the
stomach, to drink

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.240 align:middle line:10%
the water in its
most acidic form,

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.240 align:middle line:10%
even down into the 3s and 4s.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Which is an interesting point.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.400 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, very interesting.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Well most people who
suffer from food allergies

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.660 align:middle line:84%
as well as gastrointestinal
digestive problems

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.940 align:middle line:84%
such as leaky gut syndrome,
the crows disease--

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.180 align:middle line:90%
another classic case.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.160 align:middle line:84%
They have problems
with swallowing food

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:90%
that they haven't digested.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.990 align:middle line:90%
They're not digesting the food.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is also true
of people who have gout.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Gout is often caused by
undigested crystals of mineral

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:84%
crystals floating
throughout the blood

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:90%
and lodging in certain areas.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And arthritis, in some cases,
is even related to this.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So you've got digestion
problems with many people.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Especially the older people
get, the weaker the stomach acid

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:90%
typically becomes.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So if they're eating food and
they're already having trouble

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:84%
digesting, if you add
alkaline water to that meal,

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.270 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:21.870 align:middle line:84%
You're worsening
all those problems.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it makes total sense.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people
are put oftentimes

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:84%
on hydrochloric
acid, for example,

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:84%
if their digestion-- yeah, I
see what you're talking about.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm not saying that
those machines are useless.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.980 align:middle line:84%
They can be very
useful if they're

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
used for the right person
with the right biochemistry

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:90%
in the right way.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:90%
They can be very useful.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But, again, people
I see are blindly

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.160 align:middle line:84%
using them thinking,
if I drink alkaline,

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to become alkaline.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.140 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work like
that, it's more complex.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The stomach acid
needs to be strong

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:90%
in order to digest your food.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about
the profile of what might be

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:84%
a good use of-- a
beneficial use of it,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.315 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of
person or constitution

00:37:01.315 --> 00:37:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that can do well
with alkalized water.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the only people that are
really needing alkalizing water

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.590 align:middle line:84%
are people who are drinking a
high volume of acidic beverages

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and they need to counter it.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But the correct answer
to that, in my view,

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is to stop drinking all
the acidic beverages.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Alkalize your diet through
celery, celery juice.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Juice once a day and
it's super alkalizing.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.091 align:middle line:84%
You know the alkalizing
power of kale juice, or even

00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:90%
apple juice.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Even though apple juice
is slightly acidic,

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.880 align:middle line:84%
the way it interacts with your
body becomes more alkaline.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And mild greens like
celery juice and cucumber

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.571 align:middle line:84%
with a little kale--
-Yeah, cucumber.

00:37:43.571 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It feels great.
Cucumber feels wonderful.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.797 align:middle line:84%
Even watermelon
is very alkalizing.

00:37:47.797 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I love watermelon juice.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:50.130 align:middle line:90%
It's one my favorite things.

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.030 align:middle line:10%
And you know,
watermelon and cucumber

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.170 align:middle line:10%
go really well together
because they're both melons.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.310 align:middle line:10%
Try it out.
-I will.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I like that, it's
one of my favorites.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.143 align:middle line:10%
So that's one way
to alkalize is to get

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:06.270 align:middle line:10%
the really mild and very water--
uh, heavily, what am I saying--

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.060 align:middle line:10%
The water containing--

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.730 align:middle line:10%
Heavily hydrating,
water-containing vegetables.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:10%
Yup.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:13.770 align:middle line:10%
Juice those and drink that
juice and-- See, what's

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.680 align:middle line:10%
going to happen is your
stomach acid is strong,

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.390 align:middle line:10%
it will digest them.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:10%
But digestion doesn't break
the chemical bonds of all

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:10%
the molecules in the food.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.880 align:middle line:84%
What stomach acid mostly does
is it physically breaks down

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.280 align:middle line:84%
the food so that it can move
on into your small and large

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.350 align:middle line:90%
intestine for absorption.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So there, the alkalizing
properties of the food

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:40.260 align:middle line:84%
survives digestion and continues
on into your absorption

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:84%
system-- which is your
small, large intestine--

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:84%
where it gets absorbed
into the bloodstream

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and there it has the effect that
you want of supporting properly

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.490 align:middle line:84%
alkalized blood so
that your body doesn't

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.810 align:middle line:84%
have to strip minerals
out of your bones

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.140 align:middle line:90%
to create the proper pH.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that pH of
your blood is 7.0 or 7.1

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:90%
or-- I think 7.1.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.857 align:middle line:90%
It's right around there.

00:39:02.857 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
the exact number.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Well some people use
those machines also

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:84%
for counteracting the acidic
effects of having tea or coffee

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and that
seems like that might

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.510 align:middle line:84%
be a good use of it,
to just to kind of

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:90%
knock it back a little bit.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I think so too.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that coffee and tea--
they are acidic, as you say,

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.580 align:middle line:84%
but I think they're
only mildly acidic

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.890 align:middle line:90%
compared to things like soda.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I think coffee and
tea can easily be

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.910 align:middle line:90%
counteracted with vegetables.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:28.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.300 align:middle line:10%
So you don't need to
go so far as having

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.680 align:middle line:10%
an alkalizing machine.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.330 align:middle line:10%
I would say it's
great for people

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.740 align:middle line:10%
to experiment with their health
and see what works for them,

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:10%
but I just-- I want to
caution people not to blindly

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.590 align:middle line:10%
walk into any kind of technology
or any kind of machine

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:10%
without actually sitting
down, keeping some notes,

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.950 align:middle line:10%
and finding out, is
it working for me?

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:51.900 align:middle line:84%
That machine may work
very well for many people.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:84%
For others, it may make
their situation far worse.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.510 align:middle line:10%
But you got to track it
in order to know what's

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.050 align:middle line:10%
working what's not working.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:10%
So digestive Issues,
absolutely not,

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.820 align:middle line:10%
if you're already having
them-- because you're

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.650 align:middle line:10%
wiping out the acid available.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.200 align:middle line:10%
I would be very
cautious about it

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.880 align:middle line:10%
if you're having
digestive issues.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Now the other thing is, I
would also encourage everybody

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.140 align:middle line:84%
if they're still
drinking pasteurized,

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:17.330 align:middle line:84%
processed milk-- take the
30 day no milk challenge.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Figure in your whole lifetime
to go 30 days without milk,

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.440 align:middle line:84%
even if you love milk, shouldn't
be that big of a sacrifice.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Why not try it for 30
days and see how you feel?

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.540 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's someone--you
can make your own almond milk.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.073 align:middle line:10%
There are many things
you can do to substitute

00:40:31.073 --> 00:40:32.530 align:middle line:10%
it that are delicious.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.780 align:middle line:10%
I have to go through that.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.990 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely, almond
milk is super delicious,

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:37.080 align:middle line:10%
that's what I like to drink.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.680 align:middle line:10%
And that's also alkalizing.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, alkalizing,
very easy to make,

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:84%
just soak them-- soak the
almonds overnight and then put

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.070 align:middle line:84%
it in a Vitamix or some
kind of good, heavy blender,

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and strain it out with a
cheese cloth and that's it.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.420 align:middle line:90%
It's super easy.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Its delicious and it's
really fatty, too.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.940 align:middle line:90%
It's delicious.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.260 align:middle line:10%
OK, so that's one way to go,
if you have to give up dairy

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:10%
for a month just to try it.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:10%
It's easy.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.300 align:middle line:84%
It's funny how addicted
people are to their diets

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.990 align:middle line:84%
that they've got
to have this milk,

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.097 align:middle line:90%
and they got to have this thing.

00:41:06.097 --> 00:41:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Your tongue is used
to a certain thing.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:08.930 align:middle line:90%
I know, I know.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:84%
But for example, when I
first got into nutrition,

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I was drinking
sodas-- all through my youth

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I had
to stop drinking sodas

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:84%
because I was
becoming hypoglycemic

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:90%
and I have blood sugar problems.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.020 align:middle line:84%
When I realized that,
I stopped sodas cold.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.990 align:middle line:90%
I stopped them-- cold.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't had
a soda since then,

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and that was more
than 20 years ago.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.920 align:middle line:90%
And I don't crave a soda.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So, sometimes, you may
think-- you can kid yourself

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.440 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that
you need something,

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.890 align:middle line:84%
but the minute you decide
that it's bad for you,

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:44.990 align:middle line:90%
you can let it go.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And you could be
better off without it.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely-- especially that.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.490 align:middle line:10%
OK, there are a couple things.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:55.490 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to ask you about the
micro greens, so why don't we

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:57.550 align:middle line:10%
get into that next,
because I don't want to get

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.510 align:middle line:10%
shoved out time-wise on
that because we could talk

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:10%
about many, many things,
and then one other idea

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.160 align:middle line:10%
if we have time left.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.880 align:middle line:10%
OK, so microalgae
is what you're--

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, micro greens,
microalgae, yes.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, I've done a lot--

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:10.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a big range.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Break it down for us in terms
of what's truly beneficial,

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.460 align:middle line:84%
the really cheap stuff you find
for $7 a bottle, and so on.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.550 align:middle line:84%
All right, well I would
say the most popular forms

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:84%
of microalgae are
chlorella and spirulina,

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
with blue-green algae
being also related to that.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Microalgae are very
nutrient dense.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.750 align:middle line:84%
They are single celled
organisms and-- oh,

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.640 align:middle line:84%
astaxanthin by the
way, is also derived

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:90%
from another microalgae.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:10%
Astaxanthin, I didn't-- OK,
that's just-- put a plug-in,

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.407 align:middle line:10%
and I mean a plug-in to just
the benefits of the astaxanthin.

00:42:42.407 --> 00:42:43.840 align:middle line:10%
Because that's more
exotic, a lot of people

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.590 align:middle line:10%
don't know about astaxanthin.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:10%
Let's do that before we
even get into the algae.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.210 align:middle line:10%
There's just so much
to talk about so--

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.410 align:middle line:10%
I know, there are.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, so chlorella and
spirulina are very different.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I recommend that men
avoid spirulina and focus

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.160 align:middle line:84%
on chlorella because
spirulina has

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.810 align:middle line:90%
relatively high levels of iron.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Women need more
iron replenished,

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.390 align:middle line:84%
so they benefit more
from the spirulina.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Men, typically-- they
can quite easily become

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.780 align:middle line:90%
toxic with too much iron.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy for
that to happen,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and when you have too
much iron as a man,

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.440 align:middle line:84%
your risk of heart disease goes
up, and heart attacks goes up.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.320 align:middle line:90%
A lot of guys don't know this.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.580 align:middle line:10%
So I see a lot of
athletes taking spirulina

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.880 align:middle line:10%
and they're taking
so much that they're

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.990 align:middle line:10%
actually building up their iron
levels and they don't know it.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:34.810 align:middle line:10%
And what's the side effect
of that, too much iron?

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.730 align:middle line:10%
MIKE ADAMS: Heart problems.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:10%
Heart problems, right.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Now perhaps a few
hundred years ago, men

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.730 align:middle line:84%
were more rugged,
outdoor individuals,

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:44.910 align:middle line:90%
and they would bleed a lot.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.940 align:middle line:90%
You know, they would get cut--

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.860 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Could use
a little dose of of iron.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I lost a pint of blood
over there in that fistfight,

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I need some spirulina
to help replace it.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.450 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense, but
since men aren't regularly

00:43:56.450 --> 00:44:00.870 align:middle line:84%
losing their blood these days--
except the ones in the UFC

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I guess, or if you're fighting
in the cages or whatever, then

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.330 align:middle line:84%
they probably shouldn't take in
massive amounts of spirulina.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:08.670 align:middle line:10%
OK, so low on the spirulina,
higher on the chlorella

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:10.000 align:middle line:10%
Chlorella, yeah.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.590 align:middle line:10%
Chlorella doesn't have
nearly as much iron

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:14.940 align:middle line:10%
but it has lots of other
really crucial nutrients.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Especially this thing--
this collection of nutrients

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.550 align:middle line:84%
called chlorella
growth factors, CGF.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And this has all
kinds of precursors

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to biological functions
that may support healing

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and immune function, cognitive
awareness, brain function,

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:90%
or neurological function.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.480 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of things, just
basic cellular potency of good

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.110 align:middle line:90%
stuff that your body needs.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So CGF is famous for that,
or chlorella is famous

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:43.780 align:middle line:90%
because of CGF.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Now chlorella and spirulina
are both very green

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.250 align:middle line:84%
so if you're going
to take them in,

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.690 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be eating
something that looks green.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.900 align:middle line:84%
For some reason that
freaks a few people out.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think the big step
is putting it in the smoothie.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.780 align:middle line:10%
That's the first place
people get freaked

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.720 align:middle line:10%
out is drinking green stuff.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.420 align:middle line:10%
Not eating it, but
drinking it, and it's

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.100 align:middle line:10%
just a little, tiny
hurdle to get over.

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a tiny hurdle.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember when
I was growing up,

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:84%
McDonald's used to
have these Saint

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.397 align:middle line:90%
Patrick's Day milkshakes--

00:45:12.397 --> 00:45:14.363 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: That's a little
different, that was minty.

00:45:14.363 --> 00:45:15.160 align:middle line:90%
 --That was green.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.750 align:middle line:90%
They were minty green, yeah.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm pretty sure--

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.920 align:middle line:10%
We can deal with mint
if it's green, that's OK.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.550 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, that's a minor
hurdle but let's talk about all

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:28.260 align:middle line:10%
of the-- the physical
cascade of effects

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.210 align:middle line:10%
that happens when we're
getting those nutrients

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.900 align:middle line:10%
from the microalgaes.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Well chlorella has a very
high level of chlorophyll

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.960 align:middle line:84%
because it's grown-- is
normally grown in sunlight.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And the sunlight,
of course, causes

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.070 align:middle line:90%
the development of chlorophyll.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Now chlorophyll is
a blood cleanser.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of us
know that beet juices is

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:51.370 align:middle line:84%
great for cleansing the blood
and lowering blood pressure

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.320 align:middle line:90%
and cleansing the liver.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, chlorella has many
of the same functions.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So-- or chlorophyll has
many of the same functions.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So eating chlorella is a great
dietary source of chlorophyll

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:07.480 align:middle line:84%
as well as CGF-- the
chlorella growth factor.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.445 align:middle line:84%
It also has other trace
elements in nutrients that

00:46:10.445 --> 00:46:13.200 align:middle line:84%
are very important
including-- Well,

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:17.320 align:middle line:84%
both chlorella and spirulina
have these pigments.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Powerful pigments.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:21.180 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
called phycocyanin.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.510 align:middle line:90%
It's in spirulina.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And many people don't know
this, but if you grow spirulina

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and you refine the pigments to a
very high grade of refinement--

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.950 align:middle line:84%
you could sell
them for thousands

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:34.971 align:middle line:84%
of dollars a liter to the
medical imaging industry.

00:46:34.971 --> 00:46:35.670 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: For?

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Which uses the pigments
to inject into your tissues

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.360 align:middle line:84%
to then run various
types of CAT scans,

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.230 align:middle line:84%
or they might combine
them with various isotopes

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:49.000 align:middle line:84%
that are emitting radiation
to do a radiological scan.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.890 align:middle line:84%
For tissue detection--
pre-surgery, diagnosis,

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.710 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But these pigments often
come from spirulina.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Spirulina has powerful
pigments, and there's

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.680 align:middle line:84%
been research on
taking these pigments

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and micro injecting them into
cancer tumors inside the body.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Resurgence took the pigments,
loaded them up into a syringe,

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:15.820 align:middle line:84%
cut open somebody with internal
cancer, exposed the tumors

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and did little micro
injections of these pigments

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:21.337 align:middle line:84%
into the tumors--
destroyed the tumors.

00:47:21.337 --> 00:47:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Did they do it
with the intention

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:24.640 align:middle line:84%
of destroying the tumor
or to be shown something?

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, this is
almost like a healthy version

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:90%
of very finely targeted chemo.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.870 align:middle line:84%
You could describe
it in that way.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, a nontoxic
way to destroy the tumor?

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.830 align:middle line:10%
But I think there's
a lot of debate about

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.910 align:middle line:10%
whether-- when you
eat the spirulina,

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:middle line:10%
how much of these properties
survive digestion?

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the answer
to that because remember,

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:49.730 align:middle line:84%
in that experiment,
they were injecting

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:51.360 align:middle line:90%
it directly into the tumors.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But I mean for the future
of-- for the whole field

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.290 align:middle line:84%
of oncology, that is an
amazing turn of events

00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.730 align:middle line:84%
if they start
adopting that instead

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:90%
of radiation and chemotherapy.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think the bottom
line is that spirulina

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:10.230 align:middle line:84%
is a pharmaceutical
factory from mother nature.

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:13.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural pharmaceutical
factory, and an anti cancer

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:90%
factory of nutrients.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.260 align:middle line:10%
And then one spectrum you
wrote about it in your book--

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.190 align:middle line:10%
because this is another one,
I was reading your eBooks

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.580 align:middle line:10%
and I was like, holy cow, I need
more of this stuff in my diet.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.480 align:middle line:10%
You were talking about
nucleic acids-- RNA and DNA.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.060 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about that,
because a lot of people

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.210 align:middle line:10%
are hearing about mutations in
DNA, or our DNA as a species

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:33.030 align:middle line:10%
is changing.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:34.850 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about it.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Well the bigger topic
there is DNA repair.

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And many people don't realize
that their DNA is constantly

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.290 align:middle line:84%
being assaulted by
chemistry, and as well

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:51.180 align:middle line:84%
as ionizing radiation
from multiple sources.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.971 align:middle line:84%
Even going through the
TSA's body scanner--

00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Put your hands up!
You're a prisoner!

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.320 align:middle line:90%
You're being microwaved.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.310 align:middle line:90%
That's ionizing radiation.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.980 align:middle line:84%
A typical CAT scan
can expose you

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to anywhere from
200 to 600 times

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the ionizing radiation
of a chest x-ray.

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
scary is that a lot

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.790 align:middle line:84%
of those medical equipment
that's being used today

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:16.770 align:middle line:84%
is not calibrated, or
it's poorly calibrated,

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.120 align:middle line:84%
or out of date of
its calibration.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So there have been times where
this equipment was assessed

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:26.450 align:middle line:84%
to see if it was calibrated,
and they found it was

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:28.930 align:middle line:90%
2000 times too much radiation.

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:31.400 align:middle line:84%
People have emerged
from CAT scans that

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.400 align:middle line:84%
were done on their heads with
all their hair burned off

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and their skull is damaged and
brain cancer tumors growing--

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.500 align:middle line:90%
just for medical imaging.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And people can search
that, that's documented.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.300 align:middle line:90%
That's out there.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So your DNA is under
attack constantly.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Even just sunlight--
just going outside,

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.660 align:middle line:84%
your DNA is going to suffer a
certain number of mutations.

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Well your body has built-in
processes to repair DNA,

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and this gets into
the methylation cycle

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.790 align:middle line:84%
that you asked me
about off camera.

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Methylation is an
important, crucial mechanism

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.490 align:middle line:90%
for repairing damaged DNA.

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But also your dietary
sources really

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.950 align:middle line:84%
affect how much
repair can take place

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.790 align:middle line:84%
because your body has to
have the right building

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:20.450 align:middle line:90%
blocks to repair the DNA.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Now if your DNA doesn't get
repaired, what you end up with?

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.300 align:middle line:90%
A DNA mutation.

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.990 align:middle line:84%
DNA mutation, most people
know, can lead to cancer.

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But this gets into-- to
really understand cancer,

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:38.020 align:middle line:84%
you got to understand what that
mutation does, what it means.

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.960 align:middle line:84%
A cancer-- you
got to understand,

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.940 align:middle line:84%
your body is made up of
billions and billions of cells.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Each cell is its own organism.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And at some level, each cell
has its own consciences.

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, Bruce Lipton talks
about the intelligence of

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.110 align:middle line:90%
the outer membrane of the cell.

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Each cell could exist on its
own if it had the right inputs

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and outputs-- the
right environment.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Your cells agree to cooperate
for the entire biological

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.130 align:middle line:90%
system-- the human body.

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.720 align:middle line:90%
They agree to specialize.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.320 align:middle line:84%
They also agree-- this
kind of a cellular contract

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that they sign, so to speak--
they agree to commit suicide

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.690 align:middle line:90%
when they're no longer needed.

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Cells come and go.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.850 align:middle line:84%
You replenish
them, they rebuild.

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:22.200 align:middle line:90%
They die and they need to go.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Some cells that suffer
a DNA mutation-- they

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.970 align:middle line:84%
cancel the contract
and they say,

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to become an
entire body myself.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start replicating
and dividing and creating

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:36.850 align:middle line:90%
another me, another whole body.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
of cancer tumors

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.470 align:middle line:84%
being removed from people
that have teeth in them?

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:41.420 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.490 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the cell--
which again has

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:48.360 align:middle line:84%
its own fragmented
consciousness--

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that cell is trying to become
a whole person inside you.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Now if you think about
the process of gestation

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.020 align:middle line:84%
of a child inside
the mother's womb

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and developing, that
process, biochemically, is

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:05.730 align:middle line:90%
very, very similar to cancer.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of the same
chemical messengers

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.980 align:middle line:84%
are activated-- the same genes
are activated in a cancer tumor

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.950 align:middle line:90%
as they are in a fertilized egg.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:18.710 align:middle line:10%
So the process of that
egg dividing and growing

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.020 align:middle line:10%
into a full human
being is simply

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.690 align:middle line:10%
replicated in another
cell that wants

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:26.920 align:middle line:10%
to become a whole
human being and forgot

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.640 align:middle line:10%
to adhere to its contract
to terminate itself

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.231 align:middle line:10%
when it was no longer needed
to serve the community, which

00:52:32.231 --> 00:52:32.930 align:middle line:10%
is the body.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.320 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness of cancer
is a fascinating topic

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you and I can
talk about it at some point.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's do an entire show
on it down the road.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.510 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely fascinating.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:52.480 align:middle line:84%
A tumor, in essence, is a
conscious being at some level.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.440 align:middle line:84%
It's confused-- it's
got the wrong messages,

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.110 align:middle line:84%
it's out of place, it's out
of context, and it's harmful.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.810 align:middle line:90%
But it thinks.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It thinks that it is going to
grow and become another person.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.000 align:middle line:90%
It has its own consciousness.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because clearly it's
operating, by this time,

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.825 align:middle line:84%
in isolation and not
thinking about the container

00:53:13.825 --> 00:53:16.270 align:middle line:90%
or context in which it exists.

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are in
essence communities.

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Communities of cells
that agree to get along.

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Again, Bruce, yes.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.877 align:middle line:84%
And when one of those cells
disagrees with the arrangement,

00:53:25.877 --> 00:53:26.810 align:middle line:90%
that's when things go wrong.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So some of-- I think, getting
into-- I know we started

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:32.960 align:middle line:84%
with DNA and RNA but
getting into cancer,

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I think some of what really
needs to take place with cancer

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is this holistic approach,
so that we psychologically do

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:45.300 align:middle line:90%
not separate from who we are.

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I think when we carry around
the energy of separation,

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:84%
of isolation, of
division, I think

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:56.040 align:middle line:84%
we send it almost a subliminal
message to our cells.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.230 align:middle line:84%
We do that to our
own bodies though.

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:01.160 align:middle line:84%
We have been disconnected
from responsibility

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.550 align:middle line:84%
of our own bodies because
it's been hijacked.

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's been reinforced by the
medical mythology of our time.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Almost like our
body is an enemy on some level.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, look at that.

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:15.310 align:middle line:84%
When you look at oncology in the
way chemotherapy is described

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:20.040 align:middle line:84%
by cancer doctors, I've heard it
described as a chemical carpet

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.030 align:middle line:90%
bombing of the body.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So they treat the
body as a battlefield,

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:28.100 align:middle line:84%
they treat the treatment
as in a weapon,

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and they don't understand
the holistic consciousness--

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:33.440 align:middle line:90%
interplay-- that is happening.

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.970 align:middle line:10%
Does that tie back to the
spirulina and the chlorella?

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:38.950 align:middle line:10%
And what it does in the body.

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Because that's where we were,
and I want people to go away

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:43.820 align:middle line:10%
with something-- news they
can actually put their hands

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:44.825 align:middle line:10%
on by the end of the week.

00:54:44.825 --> 00:54:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's the
big message in that.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.930 align:middle line:84%
It really stems from what
we just talked about.

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:56.240 align:middle line:84%
To avoid cancer, we need to
embody the vibration of holism.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.870 align:middle line:90%
We are a holistic system.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.700 align:middle line:84%
A multi-layered,
physical, chemical,

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.750 align:middle line:90%
energetic, spiritual system.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:07.720 align:middle line:84%
We are physically
made of the things

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:12.980 align:middle line:84%
that we consume, swallow,
absorbed, drink, whatever.

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:17.020 align:middle line:84%
If we eat things that are
isolated-- isolated extracts,

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.670 align:middle line:84%
isolated vitamins, isolated
chemical compounds known

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:23.650 align:middle line:84%
as prescription medications--
if we eat things that

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:26.580 align:middle line:84%
are isolated from
nature, our bodies

00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.470 align:middle line:90%
become isolated from nature.

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:30.400 align:middle line:90%
This is more than biochemistry.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.990 align:middle line:10%
This is a deep energetics
of food and medicine.

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:38.670 align:middle line:10%
So when we return to foods
that our whole foods--

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.071 align:middle line:10%
Which these are single celled
whole complete organisms.

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:41.770 align:middle line:10%
They are.

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:45.220 align:middle line:10%
The microalgaes-- chlorella
is a complete, whole food.

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.660 align:middle line:84%
You could live off of
it for a very long time.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Just it and water.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And it has vitamin
B12, by the way.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:54.130 align:middle line:90%
That's true, yes.

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:55.080 align:middle line:90%
You could live off of it.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.501 align:middle line:84%
It's got the right minerals--
oh, it's about 50% protein,

00:55:58.501 --> 00:56:02.500 align:middle line:84%
by the way.
So you need that protein.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So again, that goes back
into the system of holism.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:10.240 align:middle line:10%
It sends-- I think there
are messages from food.

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And Doctor Emoto has his
book-- "Messages from Water"

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I think is the name.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are also
messages from food

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.560 align:middle line:90%
because food contains water.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:23.140 align:middle line:84%
When you eat a whole food like
chlorella or like spirulina

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.010 align:middle line:84%
or just a carrot
right out your garden,

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:27.780 align:middle line:84%
the message that it
sends to your body

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:33.930 align:middle line:84%
is to reflect holographically
the holism that's in the foods

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:35.560 align:middle line:90%
that you choose to consume.

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.740 align:middle line:84%
But when you pick a food off
the grocery store shelf that

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.440 align:middle line:84%
is isolated chemicals--
It's MSG, it's aspartame,

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.500 align:middle line:84%
it's synthetic vitamin C
in the form ascorbic acid,

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.230 align:middle line:84%
it's synthetic B vitamins,
it's cyanocabalamin--

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:53.080 align:middle line:84%
the artificial synthetic
cyanide bound form of B12.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.620 align:middle line:84%
When you do these things,
you're sending a message

00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.130 align:middle line:84%
your body that--
oh, it's all parts

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:00.190 align:middle line:90%
in isolation and detachment.

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you go and you get
sick, and you go to the doctor,

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor gives you the
same message-- oh, you're

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.470 align:middle line:84%
going to see a
foot doctor, you're

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:08.770 align:middle line:84%
going to see an eye
doctor, a nose and throat

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:10.701 align:middle line:90%
doctor, a reproductive doctor.

00:57:10.701 --> 00:57:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're all different
people in different departments

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.370 align:middle line:90%
and you're compartmentalized.

00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's reinforced
at every level.

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:23.490 align:middle line:10%
OK so, you also take this as
far as your supplementation,

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:26.280 align:middle line:10%
and I know you're now
working with MegaFoods

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.660 align:middle line:10%
which is a fabulous whole
food vitamin distributor.

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.160 align:middle line:10%
Because again, it's whole
foods, and I've been

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.040 align:middle line:10%
using MegaFoods for many years.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.410 align:middle line:10%
And so again, the
notion if you're

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:37.260 align:middle line:10%
going to find some kind
of supplementation,

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.430 align:middle line:10%
find it in its whole parts.

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.740 align:middle line:84%
MegaFoods feeds
nutrients to yeast

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:47.594 align:middle line:84%
and allows the yeast to
grow and assimilate--

00:57:47.594 --> 00:57:49.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Programmed
with that information.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:50.914 align:middle line:84%
The nutrients, make
them bio-available,

00:57:50.914 --> 00:57:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and then that's
what you eat, which

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.980 align:middle line:90%
is what we're supposed to do.

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.170 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
a minute or so left.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:58.060 align:middle line:10%
Just to kind of wrap it,
if you want to go boom,

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:00.110 align:middle line:10%
boom, boom, boom-- We've
talked about aloe vera

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:00.940 align:middle line:10%
and it's wonders.

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.810 align:middle line:10%
We've talked about-- we
didn't talk about astaxanthin.

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:06.020 align:middle line:10%
Just, in a minute, can you
talk about astaxanthin?

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's derived
from another microalgae

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:12.070 align:middle line:10%
that does blood red color, and
it is incredible for endurance.

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:14.140 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible for
protective effects.

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.380 align:middle line:84%
The astaxanthin is formed
by the microalgae when it

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.240 align:middle line:90%
is stressed by its environment.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.060 align:middle line:84%
It turns red, it
builds a cocoon.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The cocoon protects from
ultraviolet radiation

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and allows that microalgae
to survive in a drought

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.590 align:middle line:90%
for hundreds of years.

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:29.670 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're eating
that helps your body protect--

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:32.490 align:middle line:84%
it also helps your body
protect from sunlight,

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:34.130 align:middle line:90%
from too much sunlight.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:36.230 align:middle line:10%
So that's the short story on--

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:39.970 align:middle line:10%
And so we're going to be
looking at-- but mostly

00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:43.680 align:middle line:10%
chlorella for the women, with
spirulina in the opposite

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.967 align:middle line:10%
for men, and give us the best--

00:58:44.967 --> 00:58:45.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, chlorella for men?

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.833 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: For men, and--

00:58:46.833 --> 00:58:48.640 align:middle line:90%
And women can do either one.

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.250 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And
let's talk about the best

00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:51.550 align:middle line:90%
sources you know out there.

00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, chlorella is not grown
in the United States at all.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And we've tested all the
sources from all the countries

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.430 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
which is basically

00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Japan, Korea, India, China.

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Those are the main ones.

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:04.110 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Your top choice?

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:08.510 align:middle line:84%
My top choice is chlorella from
South Korea, which is virtually

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:10.480 align:middle line:90%
free of all metal contaminants.

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And the most contaminated
sources we found

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.500 align:middle line:90%
were out of China.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Big surprise.

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Not a-- not a surprise, right.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Japan was in the
middle, but people

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:23.554 align:middle line:90%
were concerned about radiation.

00:59:23.554 --> 00:59:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not that's
legitimate for chlorella,

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.070 align:middle line:84%
but that's another story but--
there's the short answer.

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:28.300 align:middle line:10%
And they have its own
way of dealing with that,

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.170 align:middle line:10%
I understand.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:31.740 align:middle line:10%
You are an absolute
treasure on every level,

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.170 align:middle line:10%
and I really appreciate
the fact that you

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:34.910 align:middle line:10%
can go to the depth of
it and the consciousness

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:36.607 align:middle line:10%
of virtually everything.

00:59:36.607 --> 00:59:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a
pleasure to be here,

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and I hope we get
to do this again.

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't get this opportunity
to talk with people like you

00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.900 align:middle line:90%
very often, it's great.

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we will definitely
do this again.

00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.350 align:middle line:84%
That was my interview with
Michael Adams in Austin, Texas.

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:50.460 align:middle line:10%
Hopefully this
conversation is giving you

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.650 align:middle line:10%
two relatively
inexpensive and useful

00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:56.180 align:middle line:10%
ways to take the reins back
toward chronic good health.
