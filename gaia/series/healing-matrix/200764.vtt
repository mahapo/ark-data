>>SUE MORTER: Though our
bodies are amazingly designed

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:10%
to heal themselves,
they are constantly

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:10%
being overtaxed by the steadily
rising number of toxins

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:10%
all around us the
practice of detoxification

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:10%
is an ancient one, and is
necessary now more than ever

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:10%
to deal with the ever-growing
threats to our well-being

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:10%
and restore our body's
natural ability to heal.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Junger.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful to have you

>>ALEJANDRO JUNGER: It's
wonderful to-- wonderful

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:90%
to be here.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wonderful.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about your
background and how

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
you came to focus your attention
in detox the way that you are.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:10%
>>JUNGER: I was born in Uruguay
in South America where life,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:10%
by default, was very healthy.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
There were no supermarkets
back when I was born.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So we bought our food in
the food markets, right?

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And we knew the farmers and
how they grew their food

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:90%
and there was no chemicals.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:10%
So by default
everything was fine.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:10%
My mother would
cook all our meals,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:10%
and we were healthy and strong.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Then I moved after
medical school to New York

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
to do my post-graduate
training, and there, life

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:90%
was completely different.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to
eat from supermarkets

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and get things in boxes
in jars and tubes,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and then put something
in the microwave oven,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and in two minutes I
would have something

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.419 align:middle line:84%
that looked like what my mother
took all day to cook, right?

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But as I went on living and
working hard there and all

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
the stress of
training in medicine,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:90%
I started getting sick.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of my
training, I was really sick.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I took a few days off and
saw a gastroenterologist,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
a psychiatrist,
and an allergist,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and I was diagnosed with severe
depression, severe allergies,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and irritable bowel
syndrome, and I was given

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:90%
seven prescription medications.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I refused to take seven
prescription medications,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:90%
and I had two big aha moments.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
One was that I wouldn't want
to live on pills in order

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to function every day,
but the second one

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
was that that is exactly what
I was doing for my patients.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:90%
So I took off.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I went to India to
live in a monastery,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I learned a few
things, and I kept

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
on looking for a solution
for my health problems

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
that didn't include
seven pills every day.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I stumbled
upon the concept and practices

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
of cleansing and detoxification
that I was able to completely

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:90%
restore my health and some.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I looked and felt
10 years younger.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
To the point that
all my patients

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and my family and my
friends were asking me,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:90%
what should I do?

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to do the same.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
That's when I started
looking into cleansing

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:90%
and detoxification.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can we explain
for our audience what

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
you mean by detox
for those that are

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:84%
tuning in just kind of beginning
this journey for themselves?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: So
detoxification is actually

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
the description of a biochemical
process that is actually better

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
named biotransformation,
which is what our cells,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
especially in the liver, but
in many other places, too,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
what they do is they
detect in the blood

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
the molecules that
are toxic, and they,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:84%
through enzymes, effect changes
in them, chemical changes.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Some atoms get taken
away from the molecules,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
some atoms are put in,
and they biotransform

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
these toxic molecules
into non-toxic.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And also, they biotransform
them from liposoluble,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
meaning they only
dissolve in fat,

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
which is 90% of the exotoxins
that we are exposed to and end

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
up in our blood, and they
turn them into water-soluble,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
which is the only way in which
our bodies can eliminate these

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:90%
molecules to--

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Take It out
through the bladder--

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: Through sweat,
through urine, through feces,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:90%
through breath, right?

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
specific set of reactions

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:84%
that happen in the body that
can be called detoxification.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how essential
is it for people

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:84%
to focus on detoxification
specifically today?

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: The problem
today is that because

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
of our unnatural
lifestyle and because

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
of the increase in external
toxins that we are exposed to,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
we are left with a situation in
which toxic molecules are more,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
but the work of
detoxification is less,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:90%
so it's like a double-whammy.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And the work of detoxification
is less for two main reasons.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that
energetically, the body

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:84%
has only a certain
amount of energy

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
every day, until you go
back to sleep and recharge,

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and it has to
allocate this energy

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
to work, thinking, moving,
hair growing, heart beating,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
digesting, and detoxification,
among others, right?

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But because we are
digesting all the time,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and digestion consumes
energy, there's

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
energy that's been stolen
from other functions,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and detoxification
is one of them.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows or
has had the experience

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that if you have a very large
meal, you end up getting tired

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and can only go to sleep, right?

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:84%
That is because digestion
consumes so much energy, right?

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So because we are
eating all the time,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:90%
we're digesting all the time.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
There's many functions
that are actually

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
being stolen energy from,
detoxification being only one

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:90%
of them, right?

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So that reduces the
work of detoxification.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Plus, as I said, the liver
cells and other cells,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
they add molecules to
the toxic molecules

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to transform them into
something different.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Where are the molecules
that they add coming from?

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:84%
These are nutrients, and our
foods are devoid of nutrients.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So many of the nutrients that
our liver cells need in order

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
to complete optimally their
work of biotransformation

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
are not even provided
to them by us

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
through our modern
food-like processed.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So even though the body
is designed to detoxify itself,

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
we're not getting the nutrients
that are needed for it to do

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that process regularly, and
we're consuming energies

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:90%
in other ways as well--

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.305 align:middle line:84%
I have some stresses that are
contributing to this as well--

00:08:01.305 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: As well, as well.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
The stress is
contributing in many ways.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:10.380 align:middle line:84%
One of them is stealing
energy from other processes,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
but there's an increase
in inflammation

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
which also needs
energy, and there's

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
many ways in which stress puts
a dent into the detoxification

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:90%
work of the body.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we only have so
much energy to work with,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and if it's being consumed
with stresses and other things,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.617 align:middle line:84%
it's not available for this
detoxification process.

00:08:31.617 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: That's exactly right.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: In the history
of detoxification,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:90%
it goes way back.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.580 align:middle line:84%
What can you share
with us about--

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: So what's
crazy is that we

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
talk about detoxification
because of all

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:84%
the toxic molecules
that we are exposed to

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.170 align:middle line:84%
through the air we breathe and
the water we drink and shower

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:84%
with, the medications we
use, the cosmetics we use,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:84%
the cleaning products that we
apply to everything, but mostly

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:84%
through the foods or food-like
products that we eat, right?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And all these are relatively new
in our evolutionary time line.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But detoxification
is not a new concept,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
it's a millinery concept
in practice, right?

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the body in
itself produces toxins--

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:90%
endotoxins.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So the body has a system
to get rid of these toxins,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:84%
neutralize and
eliminate these toxins.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And it also
recognizes things that

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
are not beneficial or toxic from
the outside-- the exotoxins,

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But detoxification as a concept
is thousands of years old.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the basis of
many systems of medicine.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine is
based on detoxification

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:53.070 align:middle line:84%
as one of the core principles--
one of the pillars of health

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
is a good detoxification
system, a working

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and optimal
detoxification system.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you tell us a little
bit about your clean detox

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So what are the main
components of that program?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: So one
is the reduction

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
of the workload of
the digestive system,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and we do that by replacing
breakfast and dinner

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:90%
with a liquid meal.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:84%
A liquid meal needs much
less work of digestion.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And then for lunch,
there is a solid meal,

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
but it is choosing from a
list of foods that are allowed

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and leaving out another list
of foods that are not allowed,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
which would be the
foods that are generally

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
causing allergic reactions, all
kinds of negative reactions,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
like acidification,
mucus-forming,

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of food
sensitivities that

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
may not be allergies in itself,
but are hindering some aspect

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:90%
of bodily functions.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So are you
working with the pH

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
with monitoring the
alkaline-acid balance

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.853 align:middle line:90%
in the body with it?

00:11:09.853 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Or is that just a
byproduct of the foods

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.562 align:middle line:90%
that you're recommending?

00:11:12.562 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: It's a
byproduct, yeah.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I've looked into that
when designing it,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't follow that on people--

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.683 align:middle line:84%
that there's no need to follow
pH while you do the program.

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So if they
eat these foods,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.058 align:middle line:84%
they're going to create
an alkaline environment

00:11:28.058 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
in the body which
allows the system

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to function the way that
it's designed in general?

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: They're
going to create

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.005 align:middle line:90%
a lack of excess acidity.

00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the
system doesn't have

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:90%
to work so hard to do its job?

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Exactly.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.395 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We're not
overlearning it.

00:11:45.395 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: When
there's more acidity,

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:84%
then the body has to counteract
to keep homeostasis, right?

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And your bones will start
fizzling their salts out

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
in order to buffer that
acidity with the resulting

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
osteoporosis and many other
problems of a constant acid

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.338 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:12:12.338 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the original
program was 21 days.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:10%
>>JUNGER: Yes.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And now you've
come out with a "Clean 7,"

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:10%
which is people in seven days
could start to experience

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.038 align:middle line:10%
enough of a shift that they
might be encouraged to go--

00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:10%
>>JUNGER: To get a taste.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --a longer period
of time to do deeper work.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: It's
reducing the workload

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
of the digestive system
and then supporting

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
the liver and the other
detox organs and tissues

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:90%
nutritionally, right?

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And also adding a
few other things

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:84%
like probiotics, herbal
antimicrobials, and liver

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
support with silymarin,
things like that, right?

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So you support every
aspect of detoxification.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So stop
the runaway train,

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and then let's start to
refuel and recollect.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So what's the protocol
for the Clean 7?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: So the
protocol for this--

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
for Clean 7 is a
little different.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Clean 21 is shake, lunch,
shake, same thing for 21 days.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
The protocol for Clean 7
is, shake, lunch, shake.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
The second day, you have shake,
lunch, but the second shake,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:84%
the dinner shake is two hours
earlier than the night before.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:84%
On day 3, dinner shake
even two hours earlier

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:90%
than the second day, right?

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So you're building up
the window that you

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:84%
leave between the last meal
of one day, from 12 hours,

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.650 align:middle line:84%
to the first meal of the other
day, to 14 hours, to 16 hours,

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and then on day 4 to
day 5, you do from lunch

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:90%
to lunch a 24-hour fast.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mmm.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So this program is safe
for anyone to plug into?

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Not really.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Pregnant women
shouldn't be doing it.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Breastfeeding is not a good
time to do that either.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And then people that
are taking medications

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that need a very constant blood
level, like anti-epileptics,

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:84%
antiarrhythmics, blood-thinning
medications, anticoagulants,

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.610 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:84%
All those medications need very
constant blood levels, right?

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
changing things drastically

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your
habits and diet,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.080 align:middle line:84%
absorption rates can
bring the levels high up,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and if you're anticoagulants,
you can bleed out,

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
or if you're on antiarrhythmics,
you can trigger an arrhythmia.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So those patients I asked
to be followed very closely

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:84%
by whoever prescribe
those medications.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so if people
do have challenges

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
on the program, what types of
challenges might we anticipate?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: One of the
problems that people

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
have in the few days
at the beginning

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
is when they have withdrawals of
whatever they were dependent on

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:90%
or addicted to, right?

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's coffee,
sugar, alcohol--

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that you've
been using nonstop sometimes

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
in order to function,
stopping that is difficult. So

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:90%
you go through withdrawals.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Coffee is a very typical one.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So many people I used to
only functioning and starting

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
their day after they had
their cup of coffee, right?

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So the first two three
days of no coffee

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:84%
may elicit headaches and
all kinds of reactions,

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
but by the third, fourth
day, most people are sailing.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then you
mention boosters

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:90%
to make the detox even deeper.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>>JUNGER: So that is how
I achieved in seven days

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:10%
a deeper experience
in my new program

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:10%
than the first seven days of
the 21-day program, right?

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:84%
The 21-day program is
like running a marathon,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and it has a very specific
kind of benefit, right?

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But the seven days is like
running a sprint race, right?

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And that is how I was able to
achieve deeper results in seven

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:84%
days, by using what we're
talking about as boosters,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Which are the advaitic
adaptigenic herbs

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that I included on
the seven-day program.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So someone's now taking
some herbal supplementation

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
alongside of doing
the shakes and having

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
the intermittent
fasting, and it's

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
allowing for a faster
cleanse to happen

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:84%
in a safe manner that isn't
going to cause side effects.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Yeah.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, usually there
is no side effects

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:90%
even if you don't use the herbs.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The herbs, more than
avoiding side effects,

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:90%
are just deepening things.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:06.849 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:90%
And what is deepening?

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: Deepening
means, for example,

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that happens
because of our sad standard

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
American diet is that our
inflammatory system is

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:90%
constantly turned on, right?

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Food harms our
intestinal lining,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
these little hyper-permeability
holes we call leaky gut, right?

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Are created, the inflammatory
system is right there,

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
it starts getting
activated, and we

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:84%
are walking around with
a factory of inflammation

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:90%
in our bellies, right?

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And that, already by
an elimination diet,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:84%
by replacing meals for liquid
meals start getting reduced.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you add
turmeric to the mix,

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:84%
then it's like really putting
out the fire with three fire

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:90%
trucks as opposed to--

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: A garden hose.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Yes.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: [LAUGHS]
Yes, turmeric has

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.535 align:middle line:90%
wonderful, wonderful benefits.

00:18:12.535 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: And that's
one of the herbs we use.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:90%
But there's others.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
There's ashwagandha,
there's shatavari.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Each of them has a different
role in this whole scheme.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Right?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I think it'd be valuable
to share some of these herbs,

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.635 align:middle line:84%
because and then people might
recognize some of these names,

00:18:32.635 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that you have a
program that puts them together

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:84%
in a fashion that will
be most beneficial--

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: I'll give
you the rundown.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: So one
of them is moringa.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:47.800 align:middle line:10%
Moringa is the most
incredible and complete source

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:10%
of nutrition that exists.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:90%
There is a doctor--

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
there was a doctor,
Dr. Narendra Singh who

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
was a legend of
Ayurvedic medicine--

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
he was an MD and an
Ayurvedic medicine doctor,

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and I had the fortune of
spending some time with him

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him
about moringa, and he

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
said that a human being can
live only on moringa and water,

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:84%
meaning moringa that
has every nutrient

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
that a human being requires for
life and optimal functioning,

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So it is the best multi-vitamin,
multi-mineral, multi

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:90%
-antioxidant that exists.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Moringa is an amazing,
amazing Ayurvedic herb.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Another one is
turmeric, which is

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:84%
best-known for its
anti-inflammatory

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and analgesic effects, right?

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's only
one of them, right?

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%
It's also full of antioxidants.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It's also a really
good prebiotic,

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and so it helps the
intestinal flora.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's many other
benefits from it, right?

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Then a third Ayurvedic herb--

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and I call these
Narendra's favorite--

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Narendra Singh,
this legend told me,

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
these are my favorite herbs
for detoxification, right?

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So moringa, turmeric,
ashwagandha,

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
which is the most
potent adaptogen, right?

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's now talking
about adrenal fatigue,

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and ashwagandha is the
one that could really help

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:90%
with recharging your adrenals.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
high blood pressure

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and a stressful situation,
it will bring it down.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's a powerful
adaptogen, right?

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Then there is
shatavari, which is

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
really well-known in India
for balancing female hormones,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So those are some
of the main ones.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you're
working with these

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.587 align:middle line:84%
in a balanced fashion
that allow people

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to get the proper dosages,
to get the effects that we're

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
looking for detoxification
without someone having

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to manage
all that on their own?

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Absolutely.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is the
greatest benefit of Clean 7

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:90%
would you say?

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: So in
my opinion, we are

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:84%
so oblivious to what is
happening to us in terms

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:84%
of the difference
between how we live

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and how nature designed
us to live, right?

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't question breakfast,
lunch, and dinner,

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:84%
we just sit down and
eating-- and actually, we

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:84%
think this is healthy,
having three meals a day.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Some doctors say
five meals a day,

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
some personal trainers they
have six meals a day, right?

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is is that
our design by nature

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:90%
is completely different.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
the clean program,

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:84%
you start questioning
all these things, right?

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:10%
And this is mentally
and a level of awareness

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:10%
a really good effect.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But other than
that, inflammation

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:09.360 align:middle line:84%
gets reduced, leaky gut
starts to get repaired.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:10%
All the repair
processes in the body

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:10%
have a chance to function
and repair things, right?

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You lose weight, your
skin looks shiny,

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and your eyes look
bright and white.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a glow about people
that finish the program.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Sleep becomes
incredibly better, deep.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:84%
People are calm by the
end of the program.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:90%
Calm and even.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, digestion improves,
bloating disappears.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:84%
The puffiness that people
walk around these days

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:90%
just melts away.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:90%
The benefits are--

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Quite a few.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Quite a few.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how often
do you recommend

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:90%
someone do the program?

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: Depending on where
that person is at the time.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to think
of detoxing programs

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.310 align:middle line:90%
as you think of showers, right?

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And how often you
need a shower really

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
depends on what you
do between showers.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
How often you need
a clean program

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
is depending on what do you
do between clean programs.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
If you finish the clean
program and you go back

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:84%
to your coffee, pizza,
and sugar and whatever,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
need one right away.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you maintain
the benefits and you

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:84%
watch to reduce the exposure
to toxins in so many ways,

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:84%
then the hope is that
eventually, nobody

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:84%
will need a detox program,
because the body's already

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:90%
detoxing.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Right?

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you learn
how to support the detox

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
processes in the
body, and then you

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:84%
learn how to reduce the
exposures of the toxins

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.025 align:middle line:84%
that you are absorbing,
you'll be fine.

00:24:01.025 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you
share with us some

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:84%
of the more dramatic healings
that have come from the program

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:90%
that you are aware?

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: Somebody sent
their sister-in-law to me.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And when she came to see me,
I was working in New York,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and she basically
told me, I'm very

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
afraid my doctor
wants me to start

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.000 align:middle line:90%
methotrexate and prednisone.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Methotrexate is a
chemotherapy agent, right?

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's designed to really
attack your immune system

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:84%
so that your immune system
doesn't attack your own body.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
This woman had an autoimmune
disease called spondylosis,

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:90%
ankylosing spondylosis.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to have
kids, she was just married.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So she was very afraid that
chemotherapy would prevent that

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:90%
from happening in the future.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And so she came with all the
autoimmune positive tests,

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and she was being seen by one
of the great doctors in New

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:90%
York for that subject, right?

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her,
listen, let's try--

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:84%
before you start this treatment,
let's do detoxification.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And for her, I had to
personalize it, because she

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:90%
also had mercury toxicity.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So to the 21-day program,
I added a chelating agent,

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and I started slowly
detoxifying her mercury as well.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:41.210 align:middle line:84%
She went back to her doctor
and said, I want to wait,

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and I'm doing this program.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
To make a long story
short, three months later,

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
she not only had no
symptoms, the color

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:84%
had returned-- she
was gray when she

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:84%
came to see me the
first time, and then

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.610 align:middle line:90%
she was pink and radiant.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And the ANA, the
positive antibodies

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
towards her own cells
turned negative.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So it was just an
amazing result.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wonderful.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:10%
We have a video
testimonial of one

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:10%
of the many people
who've profoundly

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.080 align:middle line:10%
benefited from the original
21-day clean program.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.518 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at April
DeMarco's experience.

00:26:23.518 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL DEMARCO: Well, I sleep.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:10%
I think that would be the
greatest time line for a clean.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Sleep through the night.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:84%
My name is April
DeMarco, and we're here

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:84%
in New York City, as we hear
form the noise behind us.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%
And I'm here to [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had a lot
of health conditions,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of accepted
them and lived with them.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.350 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I was
a clinical insomniac.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I didn't sleep for
more than three hours

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.550 align:middle line:90%
a night for 10 years.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I had lost a very close
friend of mine last year,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and I spent a period of
time gaining some weight,

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.140 align:middle line:90%
emotionally eating.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I definitely was depressed,
and at that time,

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.900 align:middle line:84%
like a serendipity, from
several different ways,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:90%
I kept on hearing about Clean.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:10%
My sister referred me
to the Goop website.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.388 align:middle line:10%
I caught a Martha Stewart
interview with Dr. Junger.

00:27:27.388 --> 00:27:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I decided I was going to read--

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:84%
order and read
this book, "Clean."

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:10%
And when I saw the
variety of foods,

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.180 align:middle line:10%
I understood now that I
could do this for 21 days.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:90%
It was unmistakable.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:84%
By the third night I was
beginning to sleep longer.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And by the fifth night, I
slept through the night.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what I sounded like
five days of eating this way,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and now I was cured of something
I was ill of for 10 years.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.025 align:middle line:90%
I was blown away.

00:28:02.025 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So this was the result
of the 21-day program.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:09.710 align:middle line:84%
How do the results of the
seven-day program compare?

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: It's a
taste of that, right?

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:10%
I mean, as you
heard her say, she

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:10%
slept through the night
on the fifth night, right?

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So that falls well into
the one-week program.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's results like that
are possible within one week.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So what makes Clean
7 so effective?

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: It is just
a really good way

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to create the conditions and
support the detoxification

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:90%
systems in the body.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And our bodies are miraculous.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not Clean 7 that's
doing anything, right?

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Clean 7 is just
creating the conditions

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:84%
for your body to actually
restore its natural ability

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.060 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And the natural ability of the
body to heal is miraculous.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can do things that defy
even scientific explanation,

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.630 align:middle line:84%
When you create the conditions,
when you remove the obstacles

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and provide whatever
is lacking--

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: --everything
correct myself.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.892 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: One of the three
pillars that you've

00:29:14.892 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:84%
based Clean 7 on is
functional medicine.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: So functional
medicine was the--

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:84%
for me, the way to
understand detoxification.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And functional medicine
really has two main principles

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:90%
that I use in my programs.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:10%
One of them is the
elimination diet, right?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:84%
The five big groups to eliminate
are gluten, dairy, sugar,

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.550 align:middle line:84%
coffee, and Alcohol, And then
there's a few other ones,

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:90%
For different reasons.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Like night shades that can
trigger the inflammation

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.440 align:middle line:90%
processes, right?

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the five R's
stand for remove,

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:84%
which is removing the
toxic load and exposure

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to toxins in our daily life by
eating whole foods as opposed

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:84%
to food-like products,
and watching whatever

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
we are using in our households,
in their offices in order

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:90%
to reduce the toxic load.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The second R is for
restoring, restoring

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and reintroducing the good
nutrients that are needed.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.940 align:middle line:84%
The third one is
for re-inoculation.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So re-inoculating
the good bacteria,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.300 align:middle line:84%
because part of the
removing is removing

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.580 align:middle line:90%
the bad organisms in the gut.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Then the fourth R is for repair.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And as I told you before,
our Achilles heel of health

00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is the intestinal lining,
and so many diseases

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:90%
start in the intestines.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And health and disease
start in the intestines.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And the intestinal lining
is a huge part of it,

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's the border
between the outside of the body

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and the inside, the
proper inside the blood.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So when that gets disrupted
and leaky gut comes to be,

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.190 align:middle line:84%
then there's a bunch of things
that happen which lead up

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.710 align:middle line:90%
to symptoms and diseases.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.550 align:middle line:84%
The repairing of the
intestinal lining

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:84%
is really paramount for
recovering and restoring

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:90%
health, right?

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's the fourth R. And
the fifth one is relaxation,

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because as you said, stress
is a part of any disease

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:84%
no matter the disease
we're talking about.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Either as a cause
or as a consequence.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.873 align:middle line:84%
So in this elimination process
you were speaking of earlier,

00:31:56.873 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:84%
can we speak about the
difference between that

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and basic allergy testing?

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: So allergy testing is
supposed to measure antibodies.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat peas and
you're allergic to peas,

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:84%
your body will
generate antibodies--

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.430 align:middle line:84%
molecules that will attack
those other molecules

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:84%
that the body's recognizing
as potentially harmful, right?

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: That is the basis
of allergic reactions.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But not all food reactions
that are negative

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.620 align:middle line:90%
are of the allergic type.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.110 align:middle line:84%
There Are other
ways in which foods

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:84%
can affect the body
negatively which are not

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.020 align:middle line:84%
measurable by
measuring antibodies,

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
allergic-type reactions, right?

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
was mentioning before.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Foods that are highly
acidifying, foods that

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.570 align:middle line:90%
are mucus-forming.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
processes and ways

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.060 align:middle line:90%
in which foods can be negative.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So to begin with, food
allergy testings-- tests

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.290 align:middle line:90%
are very limiting, right?

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:10.730 align:middle line:84%
They only really
give you the results

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.270 align:middle line:84%
if you are producing
antibodies to those foods.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.195 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: And that doesn't
mean that the foods that

00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:19.320 align:middle line:84%
don't produce antibodies
are good for you, right?

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: But there's also
negative positives and false

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:84%
positives and false
negatives, right?

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So some people may have
antibodies, but not

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.030 align:middle line:90%
be allergic to the food.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And some people may be
allergic to the food

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:35.370 align:middle line:84%
without antibodies yet, or
being able to measure them.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So they're very confusing at
best and completely a negative

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.730 align:middle line:84%
at worst, because some people
then get the idea that they

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.230 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be eating this food,
and they shouldn't-- and they

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.150 align:middle line:84%
don't need them for the
rest of their lives.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that things
are very dynamic in the body.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.850 align:middle line:84%
You can be forming
antibodies to a certain food

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.290 align:middle line:84%
today because you
have leaky gut.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.730 align:middle line:84%
When that is repaired,
your antibodies

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.100 align:middle line:84%
may disappear when
you eat the same food.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So food allergy tests
I don't use at all.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:84%
What I do use is
a period of time

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.560 align:middle line:84%
in which I eliminate
all foods that

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
are known to generate
food sensitivities, food

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
allergies, and other
negative reactions,

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.699 align:middle line:84%
and then reintroduce
them one by one

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and actually see what the
experience of the patient

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
is when they
reintroduce these foods.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And I find these to be way
more accurate than any food

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.864 align:middle line:90%
allergy test I've ever seen.

00:34:36.864 --> 00:34:38.989 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Can you list just
a couple of foods that are

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:10%
acidifying so people
understand what's--

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.370 align:middle line:10%
>>JUNGER: The most
important one?

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Dairy.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.909 align:middle line:90%
Dairy is highly acidifying.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
are told, oh, you

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
drink your milk so that your
bones can stay strong because

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:90%
of the calcium content, right?

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the effect is
actually the contrary.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Because when you drink
milk, your body gets acidic.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can have your
viewers do this--

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:84%
buy this the pH strips,
measure the urine pH

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.700 align:middle line:84%
before a glass of milk,
and after a glass of milk

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and prove it for
yourselves, right?

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is that when
your blood becomes more acidic,

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:84%
the body doesn't like that, so
the body tries to counteract.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's many ways in
which they counteract.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:84%
For example, if he needs
to counteract a fast,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:90%
you start breathing heavier.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So that you start
blowing more CO2, which

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.280 align:middle line:84%
comes from carbonic
acid in the blood.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's one way of alkalizing
the body in the short term.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But in the long term,
that is not enough.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So the body starts
activating other mechanisms

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:51.110 align:middle line:84%
of buffering acidity,
one of them being

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:84%
the fizzling of
your bone's salts

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:90%
that are counteracting acidity.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So you end up with the
opposite effect of what you

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.030 align:middle line:90%
intended that milk to benefit.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Exactly.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.865 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned about
Ayurveda earlier.

00:36:09.865 --> 00:36:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
else you'd like

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:84%
to share with us about
the foundation of Ayurveda

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:90%
in your work?

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>>JUNGER: Ayurveda is a
thousands-of-year-old system

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:10%
of healing.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And the word is that
thousands of years

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.965 align:middle line:84%
ago, there were these
enlightened beings called

00:36:28.965 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:84%
the Rishis that could
communicate with the higher

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:90%
intelligent, right?

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Call it nature, call it God,
call you whatever you want,

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:46.370 align:middle line:10%
But what happened was that they
basically got the instruction

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.820 align:middle line:10%
manual for this vehicle, right?

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.280 align:middle line:90%
From the manufacturer itself.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, understands
the body not only

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.690 align:middle line:84%
biochemically, cellularly,
but also energetically, right?

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And beyond.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's an incredible
system of medicine,

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:84%
which is really
interesting theoretically,

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.470 align:middle line:84%
but what is amazing about it
is it is really effective,

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and you cannot
argue with success.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Results, right.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.130 align:middle line:84%
The Gaia series
"Thrive" dives deep

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.840 align:middle line:90%
into the science of Ayurveda.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:10%
>>JUSTINE LEMOS: When people
feel stuck in their lives,

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:10%
in their bodies on any of
these layers of the self,

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:10%
Ayurveda describes this
stock physical matter

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.050 align:middle line:10%
in the digestive tract as ama.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Ama is the product of
anything that's undigested.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:48.970 align:middle line:10%
It is gunk factor that
accumulates on any

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.147 align:middle line:10%
of the layers of the self.

00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayurveda also is
this wonderful knowledge

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.780 align:middle line:90%
of digestion.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And so understanding digestion
doesn't just apply to food,

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:05.260 align:middle line:84%
it applies to emotion,
it applies to everything

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that we take in
through the senses.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:90%
All of life gets metabolized.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we're able to do
that efficiently, if we're

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:84%
able to do that thoroughly,
then we have vibrancy.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.440 align:middle line:90%
If not, then we have stress.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Tell us more about
the Ayurveda concept of Ama.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: Ama is the
name for toxicity, right?

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But in Ayurveda,
it goes beyond what

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:43.270 align:middle line:84%
functional medicine considers
as exotoxins and xenobionics.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So ama is not only
the waste product

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.820 align:middle line:84%
of your metabolism, the
toxins from the outside,

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.470 align:middle line:84%
but it is also the way that your
body reacts to the formation

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:90%
of mucus, the retention of fat.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So everything that vibrates in
a certain spectrum of energy

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:84%
frequency which is toxic
is called ama, and that

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.120 align:middle line:90%
includes thoughts and emotions.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's like a
stickiness to the system that

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.553 align:middle line:84%
bogs it down, is it this
kind of a characteristic?

00:39:19.553 --> 00:39:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: The thing is this.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we know-- now I know
from functional medicine

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and from science
in general that one

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:84%
of the ways in which the body
defends itself and buffers

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:84%
toxicity is by generating mucus,
because these toxins are not

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.120 align:middle line:84%
water-soluble, they
are fat-soluble.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But in the interim, between
getting in the blood

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and getting dissolved
in the fat--

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.180 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, in your breasts,
in your testicles, in your--

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.850 align:middle line:84%
wherever there are organs,
there's fat, right?

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a while to
get dissolved in fat.

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So in the meantime,
they're carried by--

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.130 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by mucus,
and the body accumulates

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.880 align:middle line:84%
mucus, and then mucus that
accumulates, that's also ama.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so we also would like
to know just a couple of foods

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.360 align:middle line:84%
that are mucus-producing that
could overload that system

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.348 align:middle line:90%
and produce more ama.

00:40:14.348 --> 00:40:15.640 align:middle line:90%
So can you list a few of those?

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Sugar.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Dairy.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Glutinous-- all processed foods.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And all foods loaded with
toxic chemicals, right?

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Yeah.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.730 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the stickiness is
not only a material stickiness

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:90%
of the mucous, right?

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.947 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: It's
also the stickiness

00:40:33.947 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:90%
of bad thoughts and emotions.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Tell us about conversely
the Ayurvedic concept of agni.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: Agni, in a way,
it's not the opposite of ama,

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.360 align:middle line:84%
but it is the opposite of ama,
because when ama increases,

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.740 align:middle line:90%
agni decreases.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And to decrease ama, you
need to increase agni.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Agni is the fire of
digestion, right?

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:84%
When you throw solids
and foods inside,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
they have to be
somewhat broken down,

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.380 align:middle line:90%
and where does that start?

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it starts in the mouth
with saliva and chewing,

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:12.310 align:middle line:84%
but it really gets
accelerated in the stomach

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.250 align:middle line:90%
with hydrochloric acid.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Now grab a glass of
hydrochloric acid

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and throw it on
your carpet here.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: It'll burn through.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:20.935 align:middle line:90%
It is like fire--

00:41:20.935 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's amazing.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: --and liquid, right?

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
fire of digestion,

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and the fire of digestion
is really, really important.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.020 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurvedic medicine, it's
considered the spark of life.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you dampen it,
and if you decrease it,

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:84%
then you are decreasing
the spark of life

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and the force of life in
your body, which allows ama

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to accumulate and other
unwanted visitors to come in,

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.620 align:middle line:84%
like bacteria and fungus
and things like that.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Agni is like fire, and
when you start a fire,

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.830 align:middle line:84%
if you add too much wood,
you will drowning it,

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.660 align:middle line:90%
you will suffocate it, right?

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
with the fire of digestion.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:84%
If you throw so
much food inside,

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.600 align:middle line:90%
you will dampen your fire--

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Can't keep up.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JUNGER: Yeah

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Tell us a little
bit about the doshas.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JUNGER: As a
quantum physicist,

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.480 align:middle line:90%
you will understand this, right?

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.350 align:middle line:84%
That everything in the
planet, everything that exists

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't exist
is energy, right?

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And the different
expressions of energy

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.640 align:middle line:84%
are because of the different
vibrations and frequencies,

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.580 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So everything
according to Ayurveda

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.960 align:middle line:84%
is influenced by the
five elements, right?

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Water, fire, air,
earth, and ether.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And each one has certain
qualities of vibration.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But everything that exists
contains some combination

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:84%
of influences of
these five elements.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Not only your body, but also
the foods that we eat, right?

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Now people are affected by--

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:84%
or influenced by the different
elements in different ways,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and Ayurveda determined--
or identifies

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:21.790 align:middle line:84%
three major ways in which
people are constituted.

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:24.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're called
their body constitution

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.590 align:middle line:90%
or their dosha constitution.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how influential
any of the elements is,

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.220 align:middle line:84%
depending on your
constitution, there's

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.580 align:middle line:84%
three different body
constitutions-- body type

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:84%
or physiologic or metabolic
constitutions, right?

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's pitta, kapha, and vata.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And for example, pitta
is the one that in which

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:54.420 align:middle line:84%
fire is the most prone
to get out of balance.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So the three doshas
exist in everybody,

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.890 align:middle line:84%
but there's one dosha
that is dominant.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.930 align:middle line:84%
In pitta, for example,
the fire dosha

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.830 align:middle line:84%
is the dominant element,
and also the most likely

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.240 align:middle line:90%
to go out of balance.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.440 align:middle line:90%
How does it go out of balance?

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:90%
If you put fire in--

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.930 align:middle line:90%
so if you eat foods that--

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
whose dosha is also fiery,
then you're feeding the fire,

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.470 align:middle line:84%
then you let the fire get
out of control, for example.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:26.270 align:middle line:10%
If you're a pitta constitution
and you eat fiery foods,

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:10%
like spicy foods,
mangoes, and other foods

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:34.520 align:middle line:10%
in which the dosha
of the food is fiery,

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.340 align:middle line:10%
then the likelihood
of dosha imbalance

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:42.620 align:middle line:10%
becomes a reality,
and dosha imbalances,

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.610 align:middle line:10%
according to Ayurveda medicine,
are the root of disease,

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:48.230 align:middle line:10%
both acute and chronic.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It doesn't seem like
it should be that hard, right?

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.280 align:middle line:84%
If we just let the body do
what it was built to do,

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.450 align:middle line:84%
so this is a way that we can
get back in touch with them.

00:44:56.450 --> 00:45:00.730 align:middle line:84%
