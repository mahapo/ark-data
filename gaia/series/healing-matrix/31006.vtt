00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: How many
of us have spent hundreds,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:10%
even thousands, of dollars over
the last decades to make sure

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:10%
that our water is pure,
particularly purified from

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.064 align:middle line:10%
chlorine?

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, with that
in mind, if I were

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:10%
to suggest that you could
drink something that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:10%
tastes like swimming pool
water for your health,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:10%
you'd probably think I'm crazy.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But our guest, Dennis
Richard, is here

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
to tell you stories of
miraculous recoveries using

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.200 align:middle line:84%
sodium chlorite, which has been
dubbed MMS, or miracle mineral

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:90%
supplement, and it's dirt cheap.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show, Dennis.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a subject I've been
fascinated with and followed

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:90%
for years now.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're right at
the center of it.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, when
people hear sodium chlorite,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:84%
they go, sodium chloride,
why, that's bad for you.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
One letter can make
a big difference.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:84%
There's sodium chloride
and sodium chlorite,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.416 align:middle line:84%
and I would love
for you to start out

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:84%
by telling us the
difference between the two.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.206 align:middle line:90%
>> DENNIS RICHARD: OK.

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:10%
Sodium chloride is
just table salt.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:10%
Sodium chlorite is a chemical
that, mixed with acetic acid

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:10%
or with-- there's
many types of acids

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:10%
that will work to activate it.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jim Humble
says that that makes

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
it 100 times more
potent and powerful.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's been listed for
probably close to 100 years

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
as approved for cleansing of
bacteria from processed meat,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
from cleaning vegetables,
things of that type,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:90%
and it's very effective.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the world's
most potent germicides.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And Jim is the one that figured
out, by taking it orally,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
now it makes such
a huge difference,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and there's very little
potential downside.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Of the thousands
of people that I've

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
spoke to-- I was the first
distributor of this product

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
in the United States and the
second in the world-- and so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
over the last
seven, eight years,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to
thousands of people

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:90%
from all around the world.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.742 align:middle line:84%
And most everyone
gets a benefit.

00:02:32.742 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And not that many
side effects from it,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
which we're going
to get into all

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
the details of the diseases
and the side effects.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And we'll introduce who
Jim Humble is in a moment.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.829 align:middle line:84%
But what is it that we
put in our swimming pools?

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
this tastes like.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK, that's chlorine.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you mix sodium
chlorite and citric acid,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
it becomes chlorine
dioxide, which

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:90%
is a totally separate molecule.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.174 align:middle line:84%
So chlorine that you use in
the swimming pool, like Clorox

00:03:01.174 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:90%
and things like that--

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or that is put
it on city water supplies.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.603 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
That's very detrimental
to long-term health,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
whereas with the
sodium chlorite,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
there's relatively
little downside to it.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Even though
they smell the same.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:90%
They taste the same.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.526 align:middle line:84%
There's the biggest
difference-- I mean,

00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
just that one letter,
like you said,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
between chloride and
chlorite, there's

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
a huge difference in
the chemical make up.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an expert or
a chemist or a doctor.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going off
of my own experience

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and going from the dozens
of doctors and chemists

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to that take the
time to do the research

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:90%
and understands this.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.140 align:middle line:84%
There's been well
over 1,000 researchers

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
done on the use of sodium
chlorite, and none of it's

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:90%
made mainstream press.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it doesn't
for a really good reason.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:84%
A little bottle of it
only costs a few dollars.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.668 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I knew
a doctor, actually,

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:59.524 align:middle line:84%
who was working with it along
with the protocols of MMS,

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean MSM prior,
to soften the cells,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.640 align:middle line:84%
start dumping toxins
from the cells,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
following up in his
protocol with MMS.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was his dream
to distribute this duo

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, because
he was finding that they were

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
able to clear up AIDS in no time
flat for roughly $7 a patient.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some really
miraculous-- just like we're

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
in a little bit.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:90%
So this is big.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like you to do
is tell the back story of it.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned Jim Humble.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And get into the story--
and you can take your time,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
interesting-- of who Jim was

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and how he stumbled across
this as an agent for healing

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, Jim and I have
a mutual friend who's a retired

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Air Force colonel, and I was
listening to him lecture one

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
night from 7:00 to 9:00
at a lecture in Las Vegas.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:90%
That's where I live.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And, anyway, at 9
o'clock, we broke up.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And at midnight, I've
still got him out

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:84%
in the parking lot
saying, hey, you've

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.524 align:middle line:90%
got so much great information.

00:05:03.524 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:90%
I want to go with you.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't care where you're going.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
You get tired of me,
just tell me to get out.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I'll hitchhike home if
necessary, wherever you're at.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.276 align:middle line:84%
But I need to spend
more time with you.

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn more.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, I'm
on my way to Mexico.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And he says that I'd be
glad to take you with me,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.095 align:middle line:84%
but, he said, I just spent
$70,000 on this microscope,

00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's sitting in
the passenger seat,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of
his car is packed.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And was this
Jim or the other guy?

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.561 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: No, no.

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:90%
This is our mutual friend.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.339 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, he told me, he says,
I'll be down there in Mexico

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:90%
within a couple of weeks.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:90%
He says, why don't you fly in?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.296 align:middle line:84%
I'll pick you up at
the airport and stay

00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:90%
at my house for a few days.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I think a
few weeks or a few months

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
might be more like
it, because I see

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:90%
you have such great information.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.162 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn.

00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:50.245 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I don't care.

00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Stay as long as you'd like.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, a couple of
weeks later, I called him up,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:90%
and he's at his place in Mexico.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want to grab
a flight out tomorrow,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and so can you pick
me up at the airport?

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, it turns
out that Jim Humble

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:90%
was staying with him as well.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So he has a really nice
home right on the water.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%
So we stayed there.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I ended up staying
there three months.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm a slow learner.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How long
did Jim need to stay?

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.757 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Jim stayed
there for close to a year.

00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And so what was it that you
were grokking at that time

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
from this guy that
plays into this story?

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: OK, well, Jim--
it took me a little while

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.280 align:middle line:90%
to understand what he had.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I had been using ozone
since '91 or '92,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'd used also
hydrogen peroxide.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.655 align:middle line:90%
These are oxidative therapies--

00:06:42.655 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.493 align:middle line:90%
And effective.

00:06:43.493 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: --and I've had
really good success using them.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, with the MMS-- which
is now changed the name,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to correct
this right away-- is now

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
considered the master mineral
supplement because the FDA

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.472 align:middle line:90%
didn't like the word "miracle."

00:07:04.472 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now we're going to
get into the FDA part of this

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
story, too, and thank
you for clarifying.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate you guys
have had troubles.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.616 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes.

00:07:11.616 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So now it's referred to as
the master mineral supplement.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But, anyway, the whole point
is, once Jim explained to me,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:84%
this is an oxidant, just like
ozone and hydrogen peroxide,

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
now I got excited, because
I'd been using those already

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:84%
for, like, 15 years
with great success.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the advantage to MMS is
the fact that it discriminates.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
See, like antibiotics,
ozone, and hydrogen peroxide,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
they kill a lot of
the friendly flora

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
that we need to digest
our food, as well

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:90%
as the harmful pathogens.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of,
like antibiotics,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:84%
kill indiscriminately,
but they do a great job,

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and they've saved
a lot of lives.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
This is far superior
because it's

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:84%
able to discriminate and take
only the harmful pathogens.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.244 align:middle line:84%
And this is a long story
if we get into that.

00:08:03.244 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get into
the technical aspects of it

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
right now, because we could
blow two hours on that alone,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not that--

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into a bit
of it, but go ahead.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, it's turned
out that once I understood

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
how effective this
could be-- see,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I was about to
lose all my teeth.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Not long before I met these
guys, I had gone to a dentist

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.589 align:middle line:90%
to get my teeth cleaned.

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And the dentist says,
it's a waste of time.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:90%
He says, I just did the exam.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:84%
He said you don't have
a tooth in your mouth

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.247 align:middle line:84%
that's not loose and ready to
fall out because-- he said,

00:08:38.247 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:84%
in six months, you're
going to be toothless.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.964 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How many
years ago was this?

00:08:41.964 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: This was seven
years ago, maybe eight.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Seven or eight years ago.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.189 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, he
says, you're going

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:84%
to be toothless in
six months, so why

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:84%
waste the time and money
trying to clean them,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:84%
teeth that you're not
going to have anyways.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So he says, we need to pull
them all out right now and just

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:90%
fit you with dentures.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I had
periodontal disease,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
because every time I brushed,
my gums bled quite a bit.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, Jim got
me started on the MMS,

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
just mixing up a little bit
and brushing and flossing

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
every morning and every night.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Within four days, my gums quit
bleeding, and within a week

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I could see a huge difference in
how my teeth had tightened up.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, in the
last seven, eight years,

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.967 align:middle line:84%
I have not had my teeth cleaned
now in at least eight years.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's just shocking.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: But I
have zero plaque.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.472 align:middle line:90%
Zero plaque.

00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And thousands of
people have followed this

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.827 align:middle line:90%
protocol with the same results.

00:09:35.827 --> 00:09:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, and I'll bring up my little
piece of that story in a bit,

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:90%
because I tried it, too.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back now
to where Jim was

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.164 align:middle line:84%
in British Guiana and
that part of the story.

00:09:46.164 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Jim Humble is a mining engineer
with a background in chemistry.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's also
been into health.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
He likes to do things
the natural way.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So as a water
purification supplement,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:84%
he always carried a
stabilized oxygen.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, he didn't understand it.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
He just understood
it worked at the time

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
when he was going
back into the jungles

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:90%
doing mining operations.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's where he spent a lot
of his life is in the tropics

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and exploring for
gold and other things.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he has taken
this stabilized oxygen,

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and he had two of his men that
were packing his equipment back

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
into the jungle came
down with malaria.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And he had nothing
to treat it with.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So he sent two of
the runners back

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.055 align:middle line:84%
to Bartica, which is in British
Guiana, and the cool thing

00:10:44.055 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things that
really got my attention,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I had just been to this little
town and the back waters--

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.427 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a tough trip.

00:10:51.427 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is not a place
most people would end up.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.385 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: No.

00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But, anyway, I just happened
to have been there two

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
to three years previous, and it
was a memory I'll never forget.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But when I read that this is
where he made this discovery,

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I got really excited.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I read 24 hours straight
to read the entire book,

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:90%
cover to cover.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.201 align:middle line:84%
And it was at night time,
obviously, a lot of the time,

00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:15.575 align:middle line:84%
and I had very
poor light, so I'm

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:18.712 align:middle line:84%
holding the book up and
reading the best I could.

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So his runners--
he sends two runners back

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:90%
to the village.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.313 align:middle line:84%
And these guys, he's
thinking, they're

00:11:23.313 --> 00:11:25.225 align:middle line:84%
so sick, they might die
before they get back,

00:11:25.225 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
take them three or four

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
days to get back to Bartica
and get the stuff back to him.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it turns out that he
had offered these guys some

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.535 align:middle line:84%
of this stabilized oxygen
to see if that would help.

00:11:40.535 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know
if it will help or not,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
but, he said, I know it
kills harmful pathogens,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:90%
and so he said, why not try it?

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:90%
And so they said, yeah.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:90%
We'll try anything.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, within a few hours,
they were over malaria.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know malaria kills
more people every year

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
than any other
disease in the world.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, this is just
such a shocking story when I

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:90%
first learned of it.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: So he said, within
a few hours, they are up.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:90%
They're having their dinner.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
The next morning,
they're back to work.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.819 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Amazing.

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: So he said he
was so puzzled by that,

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.818 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't believe it.

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:18.319 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they didn't have
any kind of side effects or?

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:18.943 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: No.

00:12:18.943 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:90%
None at all.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, he sent
back to the States

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.822 align:middle line:84%
and had them ship him a bunch
more of the stabilized oxygen,

00:12:25.822 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
not even understanding
what's going

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:90%
on at that point in his life.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So he started
taking it with them,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and as he was going
from village to village,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
he was back in a
very primitive area

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:84%
where they had-- a lot
of the native Indians

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
live back there, even though
they are native to there,

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and they don't get malaria
as much as people not exposed

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:90%
to that environment.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
He said that, now and then, he
had run into some of them that

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:84%
had malaria, and he
said, in every case,

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
it worked and worked
really well and quickly.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So from that point, when
his job was finished

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and he went back to the
States, he went back,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and he spent months
researching stabilized oxygen.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:90%
How did it work?

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.050 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, finally, he
found stabilized oxygen

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.080 align:middle line:90%
is chlorine dioxide and that--

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sodium chlorite.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, sodium
chlorite mixed with citric acid

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.280 align:middle line:90%
makes chlorine dioxide.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, it
was in a 3% solution.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, he, through his
experimentation-- and he

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:90%
documents things well.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:90%
He used to work for NASA.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
He's been an inventor, a
research scientist, in addition

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:90%
to his background in mining.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So he knows how to
document his trials.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So he documented this and
found that the 28% sodium

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:90%
chlorite activated.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Now it made such
a huge difference

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and it reacted so much faster
than the 3% stabilized oxygen

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:90%
he was using.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that a $20
bottle of the sodium chlorite

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
will treat hundreds and hundreds
of patients with-- I mean,

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.865 align:middle line:84%
it's probably a
nickel or a dime.

00:14:17.865 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the same thing
that my colleague, friend

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
I told you about was doing
in Cambodia and in Thailand,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.687 align:middle line:90%
Just pennies.

00:14:26.687 --> 00:14:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And, too, I've had
quite a few missionaries

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
in different parts of the
world-- and the same areas

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about--
that I've shipped to,

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and they are finding
the same results.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I've had a number of them
come back to the States

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.690 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
they were dying.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.795 align:middle line:84%
They came back here and
found out about MMS,

00:14:47.795 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and within a couple of days,
they're ready to go back.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Now they feel like
they're armed with what

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.391 align:middle line:84%
they need to get the job done
so they can protect themselves.

00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Truly, it is like
a miracle to be able to take

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
a disease as dangerous as
malaria and many others

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:90%
and just reverse it on the spot.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Then there's nothing to fear
to go back into the jungle.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.035 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:15:07.035 --> 00:15:07.535 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I've known a
number of people personally

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that had malaria from years back
that continues to bother them.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they'll get a
relapse for no known reason.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
They'll just wake up
in the middle of night

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
or in the morning, and
it's coming back on 'em,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's a miserable,
miserable thing.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And the treatment
is so expensive,

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's not very good, anyway,
and it takes a long time

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
to overcome, whereas
this takes a few hours.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's tons of money,
millions of dollars,

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:84%
being spent trying to
find a cure for malaria,

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.919 align:middle line:84%
and Jim's had it
now for 15 years.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:49.960 align:middle line:90%
It might be 17 or 18 now.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And the FDA will
not acknowledge it.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.684 align:middle line:84%
They keep trying to
shut you guys down.

00:15:53.684 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:84%
But that's the second
part of the story.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about you
personally, because now you've

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:90%
gone to Mexico.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:84%
You started getting
a clue as to what's

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:84%
going on with stabilized
oxygen and such.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Your own health profile in
1991 was less than ideal.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.465 align:middle line:84%
You were retired by this
time, which was probably

00:16:10.465 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
a good thing, because you would
have keeled over anyway, right?

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:13.798 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yeah.

00:16:13.798 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
weighed 310 pounds?

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With a generous
52 inch waistline.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And you were telling me off
camera, in addition to that,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:90%
you could hardly think straight.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: I couldn't carry
on a conversation without

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:90%
forgetting my point.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
When I retired, my mother
and grandmother both had

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the one going
around like, what were we

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.090 align:middle line:90%
talking about?

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:90%
What was I trying to tell you?

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you were,
what, in your 50s, early 50s.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:90%
And so, in '91, I felt 90.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:90%
I felt my life was over.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.549 align:middle line:84%
I had no hope of making
a difference in my life

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:90%
because I couldn't think.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.892 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do any research.

00:16:50.892 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this was just
a matter of poor diet and poor

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle, just all
the typical suspects?

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Lack of knowledge
that we just don't understand.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I lived at McDonald's.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.210 align:middle line:90%
What more can I say?

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you had
a McDonald's body.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Anyway, now, health
has become so simple to me,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:90%
and that's a purpose in my book.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:84%
It took me 20 years to document
this book, because I documented

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
each health issue and what I
did to overcome each aspect.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
years ago, I was very

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.710 align:middle line:84%
fortunate to have an
incredible lady come

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
into my life as a
customer, initially.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:84%
She called me and tells
me her health issues.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
She said, do you
have any suggestions?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.210 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you know,
MMS is a place to start,

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:90%
because it's so inexpensive.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So why not start at
the least expensive

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and see where you go with it?

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, she had
ordered some from Canada

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.305 align:middle line:84%
before, which that was
the first distributor

00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
of the product in
the United States.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I went ahead-- now, I'd
become the second distributor

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
in the world and the first
in the United States.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.844 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that she lived
about 15 minutes from my house.

00:18:06.844 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, I
said, well, I've

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
got an appointment
in a few hours

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
within five minutes
of your house.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'll just
drop you some by.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So when I dropped it off to her,
she said, oh, please, please,

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.834 align:middle line:90%
don't go.

00:18:18.834 --> 00:18:20.000 align:middle line:90%
I've got a lot of questions.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm sorry.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time to talk.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.299 align:middle line:84%
I said, I do conference
calls every Tuesday night.

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So I said, you're welcome to
come on a conference call.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It lasts for two
hours, and I'll be

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.650 align:middle line:84%
able to answer your
questions, along with 50,

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:84%
60, 100 other people
at the same time.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:90%
And I always host a doctor.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I interview a doctor or
health care professional.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.362 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You've done all of
them, from Deepak Chopra on.

00:18:44.362 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yeah.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was with my radio
show, was 14 years ago.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And, anyway, it's exciting
to have access to people

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.165 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of
knowledge, because now I

00:18:56.165 --> 00:18:58.850 align:middle line:84%
know hundreds of doctors
that I can call on the phone.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I've got 4,000 contacts
in my cell phone,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and I've got 33,000
contacts of people

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that subscribe to my
weekly newsletter.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So I have a realm of influence
in the alternative world.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're
getting constant feedback.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So the information
is very current.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.082 align:middle line:84%
You're not living off of, like,
a dusty old study of some kind.

00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:90%
This is living and breathing.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.835 align:middle line:84%
Every day people are writing
in, telling of their experience.

00:19:22.835 --> 00:19:23.668 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:19:23.668 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Before noon today, we
had a two-hour breakfast,

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and I've taken at
least 30 other calls

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.370 align:middle line:90%
between 6:00 AM and noon today.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.849 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I got to
bed at 2:30 this morning.

00:19:35.849 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in bed
before that, but I

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
was working on my computer
until 2:30 this morning

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and woke up at 6:00
to a phone call.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've been on a phone
call or something since then.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So the only time I
get to do my emails,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's usually between
10:00 and midnight,

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.650 align:middle line:84%
or I might go to sleep at 10:00
and wake up at 1:00 or 2:00

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.222 align:middle line:84%
and do my emails,
then, in the morning.

00:19:55.222 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I mean,
you're proof positive,

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
because you only sleep
three to four hours a night.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.664 align:middle line:84%
And now you're in
your 70s, and you

00:20:02.664 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:90%
have an abundance of energy.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I've gone from feeling
90 to feeling better

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
than I've ever felt in my
entire life, even in my 20s.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone from a 52 inch
waist to a 36 inch waist.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm down to 200 pounds, which
is what I weighed when I was 20,

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember feeling
this good when I was 20.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:90%
You're a tall guy.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:90%
That's fabulous.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:20.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take this
story to when you first

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
started utilizing
the MMS yourself,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and what was happening?

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you had already
been using, as you said,

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:84%
the hydrogen peroxide therapy
and other stabilized oxygens,

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:90%
ozone.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
specifically with the MMS

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:84%
that you took it
on to this degree?

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.814 align:middle line:90%
May I regress a little bit?

00:20:43.814 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
My biggest issue when I retired
was my short term memory

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and not being able to
carry on a conversation

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:90%
without forgetting my point.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing that
I did to get my mind back

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:90%
was chelation therapy.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's a three hour IV
chelation, and in the States,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.516 align:middle line:90%
it run $120 per--

00:21:04.516 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Explain what
it is, because people

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:90%
don't understand.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They've heard the
terms in passing,

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
but most people haven't
studied chelation.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Chelation is a form of cleansing
the circulatory system.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Anything you can do to
remove the blockages

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:84%
from your circulatory system,
allow more blood flow,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:84%
increase the oxygen
to every cell,

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:84%
the healthier
you're going to be.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.509 align:middle line:90%
And so chelation does that.

00:21:28.509 --> 00:21:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What is in it?

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: The word to
chelate, it's Greek for a claw.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So as they put these minerals
in, these chelating minerals,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
like-- I'm trying
to think of the one

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:90%
specifically for mercury.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a number
of doctors, mostly MDs,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that do chelation therapy
in the United States.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To pull the mercury
out of the body or copper.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: And this group of
minerals that they use goes

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:84%
in, and it grabs onto these
harmful metals and other plaque

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and then takes it
out of the body.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I noticed
from my first few sessions--

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:90%
improved eyesight.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Huge improvement in my eyesight.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Also short term memory.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.937 align:middle line:84%
I was able to start thinking,
and my energy level was up.

00:22:20.937 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I was going from struggling
to walking 100 yards to where,

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
within three weeks taking
two sessions a week,

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I was walking two,
three miles a day.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I remember the most
expensive shoes I ever owned

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
was snake shoes that I
bought in Costa Rica.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I paid, like, $350 for
them, and that was in '91.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And I walked so
far, all the skin

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.472 align:middle line:90%
fell off those shoes that day.

00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:51.464 align:middle line:90%
I was brokenhearted.

00:22:51.464 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Your shoes were fine,
as long as you never

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:90%
needed to actually walk in them.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:90%
So much for snake skin.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Not functional.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.037 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: They
were beautiful shoes.

00:23:01.037 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.104 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all, you got
your physical energy back

00:23:05.104 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
after the chelation, and
your mind started clearing.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So you must have had
excessive toxic levels

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.082 align:middle line:84%
of metals in the body
or something that

00:23:14.082 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
had collected in
the brain tissues.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exaclty.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So you got that out.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Reason why I wanted
to go back to that before we

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
started on MMS is
because, 15 years later,

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:84%
when I ran into MMS, I realized,
after I took them for my gum

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and my teeth, primarily, was
how Jim got me started on it,

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:90%
and it worked so well for that.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
taking it orally, too.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:84%
In those days, we
were taking 15 drops

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and 15
drops in the evening,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:84%
because Jim was
under the impression

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
that it stayed in your
system for 24 hours.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.337 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:23:48.337 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:84%
It only lasts for an hour
and a half to two hours,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:90%
and it's gone.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So his new protocols
are every hour,

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:84%
taking three drops
every hour, opposed

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.002 align:middle line:84%
to taking a big
group at one time.

00:23:58.002 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is for a
chronic condition of some kind

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:90%
that you're trying to reverse.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:84%
But the added benefit
that I didn't expect

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and Jim didn't
tell me about was I

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:84%
got a-- once again,
15 years later,

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to get
brain fog again.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
My eyesight's diminishing
again, and my energy level

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:90%
is down again.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, I
was down to from 210

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
to about-- I range
between 260 and 270.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But I got a big boost
again in my energy level,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:84%
in my eyesight, in my short
term memory through the MMS.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Plus, in addition to that,
I got a big improvement

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.850 align:middle line:90%
in my spiritual awareness.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.445 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
you just don't buy a book

00:24:46.445 --> 00:24:47.070 align:middle line:90%
and read about.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
These are things you got
experience for yourself.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So could that have
been because, as you were

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
talking about with
the chelation,

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:84%
with the effects of getting rid
of or counteracting whatever

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
kind of toxins or viruses
and pathogens and such,

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
you might have been clearing
out aspects or portions

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that hadn't been
utilized or blocked or had

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.310 align:middle line:84%
crystallized so that those
little fine glands that do help

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
with our psychic and spiritual
awareness were starting

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:90%
to operate more freely again?

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So what I have
found that MMS now--

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I finally have accepted the
fact, after talking to about 50

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.160 align:middle line:84%
doctors and chemists
that understand

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
how oxidative therapies
work-- it does not chelate.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But I got the same benefit
as I did with chelation,

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.360 align:middle line:90%
but it works in a different way.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Instead of it chelating, it
oxidizes the harmful metals

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and the pathogens and
the plaque that-- and so

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
now it's able to flush
it out of the system.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:84%
It cleans the circulatory system
just like the chelation did,

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:90%
but it's a lot more affordable.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It just does it in
a different way.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So I was so excited about those
benefits, if for nothing else,

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for my first
$20 bottle of MMS,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I seen all these tremendous
benefits that cost me

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.745 align:middle line:84%
thousands of dollars to
take the IV chelation.

00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I've probably had
somewhere between 80 and 90

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:90%
IV chelations.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.965 align:middle line:84%
Each time cost me anywhere
from $60 to $120 in Costa Rica.

00:26:25.965 --> 00:26:28.215 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're getting
this out of a $20 bottle

00:26:28.215 --> 00:26:28.715 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:26:28.715 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.145 align:middle line:84%
In Costa Rica, I was
paying $60 opposed to $120

00:26:33.145 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:84%
here in the States for
the three hour session.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And I have tried some
30 minute sessions.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I would never suggest
wasting your time.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.419 align:middle line:84%
I've had doctors
say, oh, well, we're

00:26:44.419 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:84%
getting as good of results,
and it's only half as much.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
For $60, we'll give you
a 30 minute session.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I took 10 of those
sessions and seen zero benefit.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So I would encourage anybody,
if you're considering this,

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.340 align:middle line:90%
don't do that.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Go with the three hours or
with Dr. Dean Bonlie's protocol

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:90%
on chelation.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's more money up front, but
it's a lot cheaper long run.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:84%
When you stop and figure I
probably had, quite likely,

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:18.222 align:middle line:84%
90 sessions at an average
cost of probably 80 bucks.

00:27:18.222 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And with the sodium
chlorite, that $20 bottle,

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:84%
you probably had less than
a, like a half a cent,

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.544 align:middle line:90%
if that, a half a cent per dose.

00:27:25.544 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, there's so many
things out there, what I call

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
suppressed technology, that
the pharmaceutical industry has

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
been so good about keeping
suppressed and making people

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:84%
afraid of, things
like MMS, ozone.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right now, when
I started using ozone,

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I never once ever
heard on the news

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.865 align:middle line:84%
about the harmful
effects of ozone.

00:27:51.865 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, every time you
watch a weather report, there's

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.595 align:middle line:84%
a big warning there about
the harmful ozone effects.

00:27:57.595 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's
trashed by association.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.978 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Trying to
psychologically convince people

00:28:03.978 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that ozone is bad for you when
it's a necessity for health.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Every breath we take,
is we take oxygen

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
in which acts as an
oxidant that helps cleanse

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.640 align:middle line:84%
the body with-- get rid
of the harmful pathogens

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.990 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:84%
See, the underlying cause
of nearly all disease

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.090 align:middle line:84%
is some form of harmful
pathogen or environmental toxin.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:10%
And now, before that,
I should go back

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.550 align:middle line:10%
and say it's an imbalance
in internal environment,

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.200 align:middle line:10%
but once it gets to the
point that this breeding

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:10%
ground for these
harmful pathogens exist,

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:10%
now you're either going
to try antibiotics, which

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:10%
aren't going to work-- or
they might work temporarily,

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:10%
but they're creating a long term
issue that's quite likely worse

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:10%
than where you
were to start with.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the downside to
the MMS is so slight.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people now
and then get nauseated

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:90%
if they take too much, too fast.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Now and then, anymore,
people have gotten diarrhea,

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's, like,
maybe once a year.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.279 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we're taking
15 drops in the morning,

00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:90%
15 drops in the evening--

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was harsher.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Oh, yeah.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.543 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I have to say, I
tried it after I heard about--

00:29:15.543 --> 00:29:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I interviewed you few
years ago for CMN on my radio

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.820 align:middle line:84%
show, which really
piqued my curiosity.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, you
know, I think I

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
need to be a little more
serious about trying this.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.044 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- if a little's
good, more is better.

00:29:30.044 --> 00:29:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
made me do this,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:84%
but I put the activator in
and I had a solution in a cup.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And I doused my toothbrush
in it and then started

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.620 align:middle line:84%
brushing my teeth with a
very high percentage of that

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:90%
in my mouth.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like
I was coming down

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
with the flu within a few hours,
because my whole body started

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.620 align:middle line:90%
detoxing so rapidly.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And so that was the downside.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And so now your more
gentle protocols

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:84%
of using just three
drops at a time,

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I would think you
probably don't risk--

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
well, that was my
stupidity, first of all.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.935 align:middle line:84%
But you probably don't risk
those side effects so much now.

00:30:06.935 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: It's been over
a year since I've talked

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to anybody that's had
those kind of experiences.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's awesome to be able to
explain how simple this can be.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And you only have to
mix it once a day.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:84%
You just mix up a 32-ounce
bottle with a cap on it,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and you leave it sit, and
it will sit for a week.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can just screw the
top off, and you can take--

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Much more convenient.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so an area that I'm
really fascinated with,

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and I think most people
watching will be,

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.700 align:middle line:84%
is all the different conditions
that people have used this for.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, it was called
miracle mineral supplement.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some of
the cancers, for example.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.960 align:middle line:10%
And I know there's
this huge forum that

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:10%
exists where thousands of people
are sharing their experiences.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.120 align:middle line:10%
So let's just take a few
kind of dramatic examples,

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:10%
but go into some
depth on it so we

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:10%
can see ourselves in this story.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Now,
going off of what Dr.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.279 align:middle line:84%
Hitt taught me seven
or eight years ago--

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Dr. Who?

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.778 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Hitt.

00:31:12.778 --> 00:31:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: H-I-T?

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: H-I-T-T. And it was
a Hitt clinic out of Tijuana.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:90%
He's American of German descent.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:25.930 align:middle line:84%
He went to Germany, which
is the world's leading

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:90%
developer of ozone technology.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.295 align:middle line:84%
And so he studied in
Germany for a while,

00:31:31.295 --> 00:31:33.920 align:middle line:84%
came back to the United States,
found out they wouldn't let him

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.960 align:middle line:90%
practice in the United States.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.650 align:middle line:84%
The people that use ozone
therapy in the United States

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:90%
end up in jail.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So he went to Tijuana
where he had the freedom

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:84%
to practice as his
conscience dictates

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.150 align:middle line:90%
to the benefit of his patients.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:84%
He had an incredibly
high reversal

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.510 align:middle line:84%
of just about every
imaginable disease,

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and he's also had a
Ph.D. in microbiology.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.865 align:middle line:84%
What he taught me was that the
underlying cause of all disease

00:32:05.865 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:84%
is some form of harmful
pathogen or environmental toxin.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ozone
will address that.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
It addresses almost every
form of harmful pathogen

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and many forms of
environmental toxins.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:84%
It oxidizes them and takes
them from-- in a form,

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.320 align:middle line:84%
puts them in a form that
the body can eliminate them

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
through our normal
elimination process,

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.730 align:middle line:84%
through our urine and stools and
sweat and that sort of thing.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:41.237 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, this is a lot
to do with his protocols.

00:32:41.237 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't care whether
it's addictions--

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:48.670 align:middle line:84%
he had an 85% success
rate with addictions.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:84%
That blows everybody
else out of the water.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, he passed away two
years ago at the age of 84.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And it came from an
infection he picked up

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:84%
while getting a hip replacement
at a hospital in San Diego.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:08.579 align:middle line:90%
Now, he overdosed on oxidants.

00:33:08.579 --> 00:33:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
overdose on anything.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.760 align:middle line:84%
You can overdose on
antioxidants, and most of us

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.580 align:middle line:84%
do, because everybody in the
world is pushing antioxidants.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, antioxidants,
they've got their place.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
We need a balance in
everything, whether it's

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:84%
our body temperature,
our blood pH.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.040 align:middle line:84%
In every aspect of our
life, we need a balance

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.180 align:middle line:90%
in the internal environment.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you take too
many antioxidants,

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.930 align:middle line:84%
it will definitely
lead to health issues.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:84%
If you take too much
oxidation, it'll

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:84%
start breaking
down healthy cells.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what are
the effects of too many

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.080 align:middle line:90%
antioxidants?

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just getting the
body out of balance,

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and then harmful
pathogens starts

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:90%
to grow and get out of control.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.144 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see.

00:33:53.144 --> 00:33:54.853 align:middle line:84%
The opposite of what
you're trying to do.

00:33:54.853 --> 00:33:55.602 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:33:55.602 --> 00:33:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand that
the underlying cause of nearly

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.570 align:middle line:84%
all disease is this
issue, now it makes sense.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.575 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to get a balance
between our oxidants

00:34:06.575 --> 00:34:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and antioxidants.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:12.739 align:middle line:84%
And, see, to me,
health is so simple.

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:14.426 align:middle line:84%
It's made up of
thousands of pieces

00:34:14.426 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:84%
of very complicated pieces
of a puzzle of health.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:24.239 align:middle line:84%
Doctors all specialize
in some field.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:27.030 align:middle line:84%
They get so focused on
their field of expertise,

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.570 align:middle line:84%
they miss the fact that
this is their picture,

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.320 align:middle line:90%
and they think this is it.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.690 align:middle line:90%
This is the picture of health.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.230 align:middle line:84%
The picture of
health is like this.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see how
the pieces fit together,

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.600 align:middle line:84%
it's so simple because only
the body can heal itself.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Only we can give it the
opportunity to do it.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's pretty amazing
to me that they're

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:84%
missing this
simplicity of health

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.389 align:middle line:84%
because they're trying
to make it complicated,

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:84%
justifying the high prices
we're paying for health

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
when we could eliminate
the cost, I believe.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.220 align:middle line:90%
This is my assumption.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I believe we can eliminate
90% of the cost of our health

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:13.950 align:middle line:84%
care in the United States just
by understanding how oxidation

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:84%
can work complimentary
to everything else that's

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.400 align:middle line:90%
being done.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
stop this to do this.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.630 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is add it
until we find the balance.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:27.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no money
being spent on that.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the chlorine
dioxide or sodium chlorite is

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:84%
actually working in the
oxidant capacity in the body.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing that
we briefly discussed,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:84%
a company called ASEA, if I
may briefly touch on that.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, ASEA, I was so impressed
with when they first

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.840 align:middle line:84%
started, before they actually
became multi-level and hit

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.120 align:middle line:90%
the streets with it.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.626 align:middle line:84%
They flew me to Salt Lake to, I
thought, evaluate the company.

00:35:58.626 --> 00:36:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically, what
they were looking

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:84%
for is people to
multi-level market it.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think I was
the only person

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.870 align:middle line:84%
in the room that understood
their product, because they

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.830 align:middle line:90%
did, to me, a miracle.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
They found a way to stabilize
eight oxidants and eight

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
antioxidants and give it a
shelf life of a year and a half,

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.460 align:middle line:90%
which is unimaginable.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Every doctor and
chemist to this day

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.610 align:middle line:84%
have told me you can't mix
oxidants and antioxidants

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:29.920 align:middle line:84%
because one's electron donor,
and one extracts electrons.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So they're just going to negate
the benefit of one another.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:38.615 align:middle line:84%
Well, ASEA's research has proven
that you can stabilize oxidants

00:36:38.615 --> 00:36:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and antioxidants in
the same solution.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And for a year and a
half, that's amazing.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, my
understanding, too,

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.550 align:middle line:84%
is they have something
like 30 or 40 patents

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.300 align:middle line:84%
either active or pending
with this product.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.039 align:middle line:84%
And one thing they're talking
about-- the buzz word,

00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:84%
as I recall-- tell me
if I'm wrong on that.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I just jotted it
down from memory.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it redux
signalling molecules?

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.260 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean,
and how is that

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
differing from the sodium
chlorite or the chlorine

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.416 align:middle line:90%
dioxide?

00:37:07.416 --> 00:37:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, they spent
$28 or $29 million--

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.950 align:middle line:84%
a pharmaceutical
company did, creating

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:90%
a pharmaceutical product.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And once they completed all this
research over-- I don't know,

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:84%
seven, eight, nine years--
they went to try to get this

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:84%
patented so they could put
it on the market as a drug.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, they found out that
it has no downside at all,

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.310 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't
get it patented,

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:45.420 align:middle line:84%
because they won't allow anybody
a drug permit and license that

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.324 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have a
fatal side effect.

00:37:47.324 --> 00:37:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.731 align:middle line:90%
Say that again.

00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't get a
patent for something

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:84%
if there isn't a
contrasting fatal effect?

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: You can't get
approval by the FDA for a drug

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.531 align:middle line:84%
that you cannot show
the fatal side effects.

00:38:02.531 --> 00:38:04.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you've got to take--

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is this just to
establish dosage or something?

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.418 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yeah.

00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:08.040 align:middle line:84%
You've got to keep
pushing that dosage

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.250 align:middle line:84%
until you find-- I don't know
what the limitations are,

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:84%
whether they're using mice or
rabbits or whatever that is.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.940 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't kill
something, and they

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:26.360 align:middle line:84%
can establish a fatal toxic
dose, they won't license it.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's crazy.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.151 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: I know.

00:38:28.151 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this stuff doesn't
have the potential to kill you.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.024 align:middle line:84%
So ASEA was not able
to get the patent

00:38:34.024 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that they were seeking
for the purpose--

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.065 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: They
got the patents,

00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:39.020 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't get
approval as a drug.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So what they did,
they shelved it.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.920 align:middle line:84%
They thought, well, what
are we going to do with it?

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.290 align:middle line:90%
We can't sell it.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It had a lot of
scientific research behind it.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:47.538 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yeah.

00:38:47.538 --> 00:38:51.750 align:middle line:84%
They had, like, $28 million,
$29 million in the research.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the board of
directors on this company

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.520 align:middle line:84%
decided, hey, I'm
going to buy it,

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to put it out
there as a cellular nutrient.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.990 align:middle line:90%
And so he did.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:84%
He bought all the
research and everything

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and turned this into
multilevel company.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And ASEA worked for some,
but I had so many more

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.850 align:middle line:84%
that didn't see a
noticeable benefit.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But I had people
with fibromyalgia

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that actually--
one lady called me.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:22.630 align:middle line:84%
She says, in 36 hours,
I had my life back.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does that have
to do with the fancy term,

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.030 align:middle line:90%
the redux signaling molecule?

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, see, it does
many things as far as cellular

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.170 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Every cell is in
contact constantly

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:84%
with every other cell of
the body, with our brain,

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.010 align:middle line:90%
with everything.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.610 align:middle line:84%
We are energy beings
beyond a science ability

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:50.780 align:middle line:84%
to understand just who we
are and how we function.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.440 align:middle line:84%
There's so many forms
of energy we're not

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:90%
taught in this country.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.535 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people
aren't even aware--

00:40:00.535 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It seems to me
that you're talking about

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.402 align:middle line:84%
a distribution of information
between the cells, right?

00:40:06.402 --> 00:40:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Let me
go back to this.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:11.350 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, I was in the seventh
grade in Henderson, Nevada.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Our science teacher came in,
knocked on the wall, says,

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.467 align:middle line:90%
you think that's solid?

00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Knocked on the desk.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.040 align:middle line:90%
You think that's solid?

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And he went around and
pointing at different things.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said you believe
these are all solid items?

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we thought
yeah, well, of course.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.772 align:middle line:90%
He said they're not.

00:40:27.772 --> 00:40:30.920 align:middle line:90%
They're 99.999% space.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So he went on to
explain the difference

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:84%
between the electrons
and neutron,

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.010 align:middle line:90%
just like in our solar system.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.710 align:middle line:84%
This giant amount of
space between these areas

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.337 align:middle line:90%
leave us 99.999% space.

00:40:43.337 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is hard for
us to get our minds around.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.503 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:40:46.503 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:84%
We see each other because
we're not seeing the holes.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:55.080 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the electrical
energy produced by this.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.240 align:middle line:90%
So you see what I mean?

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.680 align:middle line:84%
We're not actually seeing
the hard physical you.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing the energy
put off by the color

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:84%
of your beautiful
shirt and your hair

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.390 align:middle line:90%
and your lips and all this.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.500 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
visualizing, because this

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is how we have evolved to where
our mind connects to our brain.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing this
in a energy form.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.001 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is how
we are rendering it.

00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Our brains, our perceptive
field is rendering it.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: I mean, there's a
lot of people that I know that

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.670 align:middle line:84%
can look at you
and see your aura.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
we can all learn to do,

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and I've done it a few times,
but I haven't taken the time

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.730 align:middle line:90%
to where I can do it at will.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:37.570 align:middle line:90%
It takes me a while.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I've got to look off to the
side of you and into the light.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And pretty quick,
I can start seeing

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:47.300 align:middle line:90%
the size and color of your aura.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The point is these
fields are simply information.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So this redux signaling
molecule is apparently

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.610 align:middle line:84%
distributing information in
a way that, like you said

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:84%
before, what needs to be
addressed is addressed,

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and the rest is left alone.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so why
is it, do you think,

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:09.650 align:middle line:84%
that ASEA is getting a
certain response, but maybe--

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.540 align:middle line:84%
would you say, in your
experience, that MMS,

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
just the straight protocol
MMS, people are getting more

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.710 align:middle line:84%
profound reactions from it
than they are from the ASEA,

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.270 align:middle line:90%
or is it different?

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Percentage wise,
people will see far more

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:84%
benefit from the MMS quicker
because it has its purpose,

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:90%
like an antibiotic, like I said.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.490 align:middle line:84%
It eliminates
harmful pathogens and

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.350 align:middle line:84%
many harmful
environmental toxins.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:43.792 align:middle line:84%
So the sicker you are, the
quicker you see those benefits.

00:42:43.792 --> 00:42:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Now, health issues
aren't the cause of one thing,

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a group of things
that all happen simultaneously.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you get the
environmental toxins

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and the pathogens has broken
down the immune system out

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.680 align:middle line:84%
of the equation, now
the immune system

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.210 align:middle line:84%
can better address whatever
your individual issue is.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so excited about
the hundreds of people

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.410 align:middle line:84%
that's been guests on my show
and that have been kind enough

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:84%
to take me into their home
like Stephen Daniel's in Maui.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I went over and
spent time with him.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.553 align:middle line:84%
He'd give me a car, let
me stay in his guest home,

00:43:23.553 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and he worked with me a
couple hours a day, teaching--

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.435 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
his name again?

00:43:27.435 --> 00:43:27.935 align:middle line:90%
Who?

00:43:27.935 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Stephen Daniel.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.277 align:middle line:10%
And his website is
quantumtechniques.com.

00:43:34.277 --> 00:43:34.860 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.431 align:middle line:10%
I'll look him up.

00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:37.930 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Now what I want
to do is get back

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.360 align:middle line:10%
to some of the specific
diseases and what you've

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.140 align:middle line:10%
seen and experienced through
these numbers of years, you

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:10%
and Jim both.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I know you have very similar
sites and information.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: I have
talked to, like I said,

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:middle line:84%
thousands and thousands
of people over the years.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Because on my call every
week, I may speak to anywhere

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:90%
from 50 to 200 people.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.020 align:middle line:90%
So that adds up quickly.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And then individually, I take
30 to 50 phone calls a day,

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and I've been doing that
for the last seven years.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.780 align:middle line:84%
There for a while,
I was getting calls

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.780 align:middle line:84%
at 2:00 or 3 o'clock in
the morning from Europe.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.446 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:15.446 --> 00:44:16.620 align:middle line:90%
You've heard it all.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
cancer for a sec.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: So I've talked to
dozens and dozens of people

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.720 align:middle line:84%
that have called
me and thanked me,

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's what motivates me is
the benefit I can be to others

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.957 align:middle line:84%
in helping overcome
issues like I had.

00:44:29.957 --> 00:44:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You had
prostate cancer yourself.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes, I did.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, I prayed for
years for the opportunity

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.405 align:middle line:84%
to give my life
meaning and purpose

00:44:41.405 --> 00:44:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and to where I could help
the world become a better

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.360 align:middle line:90%
place for us all.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And now, 30 years on
the fire department,

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I would have an opportunity
save somebody's life or property

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.670 align:middle line:84%
once or twice a
year, and now I'm

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.110 align:middle line:90%
getting that many times daily.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's really got me excited.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm determined to make
a difference in the world,

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and I think that my book has
got the progression of things

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.660 align:middle line:84%
that I've done that it may
not be your exact issue,

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
but it'll give you
hope and inspiration

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and give you the determination.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:19.145 align:middle line:84%
I'm no smarter than anybody
else, but I'm very determined,

00:45:19.145 --> 00:45:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and I go to extraordinary
lengths to get information.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:23.791 align:middle line:90%
I've gone to Bangkok.

00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:24.540 align:middle line:90%
I've been to Cuba.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been all over central
and South America and Mexico.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:84%
If I find somebody that
has something that's

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.560 align:middle line:84%
unique and willing to take
the time to teach me, give me

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.940 align:middle line:84%
a chance, I'll
move in with them.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about some of those cases.

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:39.641 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want to
get to here so people

00:45:39.641 --> 00:45:41.195 align:middle line:84%
can start seeing
what's possible.

00:45:41.195 --> 00:45:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
the health issue is.

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:45.270 align:middle line:90%
This should help.

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:49.095 align:middle line:84%
Because, like I said, if
you can reduce your-- see,

00:45:49.095 --> 00:45:53.820 align:middle line:84%
we all have viral
loads, fungal loads,

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and different
forms of pathogens.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:46:00.520 align:middle line:84%
There are six of major types of
pathogens, and each one of them

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.590 align:middle line:84%
are made up of many other
different subcategories.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But when you stop and figure
that they will eliminate

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the stress
on the immune system

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.640 align:middle line:84%
once they're gone, it
makes it simple and easy

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.940 align:middle line:84%
for the immune system
to address other issues.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.830 align:middle line:90%
And that makes total sense.

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking
about a systemic actual fix,

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
a clean up and
reboot, so to speak.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you a few things,
because I want to know myself.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.286 align:middle line:90%
Lyme disease, also.

00:46:32.286 --> 00:46:33.285 align:middle line:90%
What about Lyme disease?

00:46:33.285 --> 00:46:34.031 align:middle line:90%
That's so tricky.

00:46:34.031 --> 00:46:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: It is.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And Lyme disease is
probably the only one

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that MMS doesn't make a
huge difference by itself.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
a part of the answer,

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:48.350 align:middle line:84%
but there's many other things
that need to go with it.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
things is iodine.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.360 align:middle line:84%
We're living in
the United States.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Nearly everyone in this
country is deficient in iodine.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even realize till
a few years ago that iodine

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.820 align:middle line:90%
was a mineral.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was something
that, back in the old days,

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.770 align:middle line:90%
they put on wounds.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand what it was.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But now, as I progressed
in my knowledge

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:18.525 align:middle line:84%
and talking to different people,
I met a lady from Pennsylvania.

00:47:18.525 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the first one that I talked
to that had overcome Lymes.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And she did it with MMS,
the molecular silver,

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and iodine was
the primary thing.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, she used other things,
too, like very pure water

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that had energy
provided in it that

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.910 align:middle line:84%
helped it be more assumable
at the cellular level.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:51.160 align:middle line:84%
See, if you use distilled water,
there's no life left in it.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.640 align:middle line:84%
RO water, there's
very little left.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.970 align:middle line:84%
My tap water in Las
Vegas is 200 TDS.

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:00.690 align:middle line:90%
That's total dissolved solids.

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And the RO water
that I use is two,

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and in the distilled
water, it's zero.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're trying to put
this water back in your system,

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and there's no life
left in it, the cells

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.660 align:middle line:84%
don't grab it and absorb
it like they should,

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.280 align:middle line:84%
so you need to do
other treatments.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I use the RO water,
and I add minerals back

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that I know are
organic, and I add them

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and let that sit in the
sun for a couple hours.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.960 align:middle line:84%
The sun energy, combined
with the minerals,

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.500 align:middle line:90%
puts the life back in the water.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:46.535 align:middle line:84%
And then you can drink it,
and the cells can absorb it.

00:48:46.535 --> 00:48:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.200 align:middle line:90%
It can assimilate.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.945 align:middle line:84%
And there are other technologies
that are sophisticated,

00:48:50.945 --> 00:48:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that have movement and flow, and
that's another subject that I'd

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.850 align:middle line:84%
like to cover in
depth one day is all

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:59.290 align:middle line:84%
these technologies to
give life back to water.

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So Lyme disease, you
just told us about that,

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.200 align:middle line:90%
putting back some iodine.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.920 align:middle line:90%
What about heart disease?

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.807 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were talking
earlier about the chelation

00:49:08.807 --> 00:49:10.140 align:middle line:90%
taking the plaques out and such.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.035 align:middle line:90%
What does MMS do for the heart?

00:49:12.035 --> 00:49:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it does similar to
the chelation in the fact

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.560 align:middle line:84%
that it cleanses the circulatory
system, provides more oxygen,

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and usually the heart
issue is a lack of oxygen.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not getting
enough oxygen to feed

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.990 align:middle line:84%
the brain and the
heart, and those

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:32.140 align:middle line:84%
are the things where our bodies'
innate wisdom sends the oxygen

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.810 align:middle line:84%
first and the nutrients because
they want to protect your life,

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and your heart and your
brain is your life.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the system's
own innate intelligence takes

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and utilizes the MMS that way
that it needs to for the heart.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Right.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, see, the individual
aspects of all of these things

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.790 align:middle line:90%
starts getting complicated.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why these guys go
to school so many years,

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and it gets down to a
piece of the puzzle that

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.640 align:middle line:90%
becomes very complicated.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I try
to stay with simple.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.220 align:middle line:90%
You see the picture.

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:11.710 align:middle line:84%
You know this is going to
help, so you just do it,

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and you keep doing
things until you

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.974 align:middle line:84%
find the right combination
that works for you.

00:50:15.974 --> 00:50:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And every body is
a little different.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But just kind of sticking
with the overview of some

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.860 align:middle line:84%
of the different disease
classes and such that people

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.930 align:middle line:84%
have come to you
with the MMS, I'm

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:32.450 align:middle line:84%
just trying to get a feel
for the breadth of what

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.850 align:middle line:90%
can be affected by it.

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And sounds like-- you talked
about your periodontal disease

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:39.220 align:middle line:90%
and what happened there.

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.390 align:middle line:84%
That would put periodontists
out of business.

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be
embraced very easily.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.460 align:middle line:84%
What about degenerative nerve
diseases, things like MS

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.550 align:middle line:90%
and all that?

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: What I've found
is alpha lipoic acid has

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:58.130 align:middle line:84%
the ability to help
regenerate nerve damage.

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Essential oil
helichrysum does as well.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:06.330 align:middle line:84%
See, that's how I
got my hearing back.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I had lost half the hearing
in my left ear when I retired

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.070 align:middle line:90%
and about 30% in my right ear.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, through ear
candling, the use

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.040 align:middle line:84%
of essential oils,
magnetic energy,

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I was able to get
my hearing back.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So each one of
these issues, I've

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:28.460 align:middle line:84%
got a chapter on in my book
of the things that I've done.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But the two most
important things

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that people should consider
that, in order-- nearly

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:37.330 align:middle line:84%
everything I've done
in restoring my health

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:40.120 align:middle line:84%
has been through two
things, oxidative therapies

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.100 align:middle line:90%
and magnetic energy.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.930 align:middle line:84%
You know that in the United
States, when people start

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.900 align:middle line:84%
talking about energy, they're
all talking about fossil fuels.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, there's
dozens of forms of energy

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that, maybe we've
heard the name before,

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:57.180 align:middle line:84%
but we don't understand
how it relates

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.380 align:middle line:84%
or how it fits in the
piece of the puzzle.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.338 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, this
audience is pretty savvy,

00:52:00.338 --> 00:52:02.560 align:middle line:84%
so they know about
electromagnetic energy and all

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.940 align:middle line:90%
but don't necessarily apply it.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.940 align:middle line:84%
You're talking the applied
use of magnetic energies.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.290 align:middle line:84%
First, let's talk about
the planet itself,

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.767 align:middle line:84%
because this is
really important.

00:52:11.767 --> 00:52:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, thousands of years ago,
the Earth's magnetic field

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.950 align:middle line:90%
was 40 Gauss.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Today, it's down to 0.5.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.880 align:middle line:90%
So we are energy beings.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Anything we can do to
add cellular energy,

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:30.250 align:middle line:84%
it increases the
spin on electrons,

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:32.790 align:middle line:84%
making them work more
efficient and effectively.

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I've healed broken
bones on myself

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:42.530 align:middle line:84%
many times within two weeks as
opposed to six and my family.

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a beach house in
Mexico some years ago,

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.880 align:middle line:90%
and my daughter came down.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And so she used to drink like
I used to when I was young.

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So she slipped off a
curb and broke her foot,

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and she didn't even realize it.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:01.035 align:middle line:84%
She went into another bar and
got on one of these horse--

00:53:01.035 --> 00:53:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh,
yeah, those bulls?

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Mechanical bulls?

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.604 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Got thrown
off a few times.

00:53:04.604 --> 00:53:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Give me another beer, you know.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she got home at
4:00 AM, and at 6:00 AM,

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:middle line:90%
I hear her screaming in pain.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I got up to see
what on earth's happening?

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, her foot's all
swollen up and black and blue,

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:20.880 align:middle line:90%
and she's really crying.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.450 align:middle line:90%
She's in terrible pain.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I took some
big magnets, and I

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.860 align:middle line:84%
put the negative field around--
they're four by six magnets--

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and I put three of them
around her, and I wrapped it.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, now I packed it
in ice on top of that.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And she was back to
sleep in 15 minutes.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, it turns out--
this was over Cinco de Mayo

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.070 align:middle line:84%
about-- I don't know--
eight or nine years ago

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.930 align:middle line:90%
in San Felipe, Mexico.

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, this happened,
like, on Friday night,

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
way you're going

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:00.730 align:middle line:84%
to get into a doctor or
anything else till Monday.

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So Monday, I take her to
this doctor that I know,

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and he said, it's almost
a waste of time to x-ray

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.930 align:middle line:84%
it, because, he says,
there's so little swelling

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and no bruising,
he says, there's

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:middle line:90%
no way she's got a broken bone.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'd like you
to check it, just to make sure.

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:21.000 align:middle line:84%
He took the x-ray, and he
says, that's unbelievable.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a
broken bone where

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:28.660 align:middle line:84%
there's not massive swelling and
black and blue and everything.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.820 align:middle line:90%
So I told him what I did.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, well, he
said, let's put it in a cast.

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:36.110 align:middle line:90%
So we did.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We cast it up, and
then I put the magnets

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:42.340 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of the cast
and showed him how I did it.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, it turns out
that two weeks from the day

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of the injury, she took
the cast off herself,

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and she was walking on
that foot, two weeks

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:54.620 align:middle line:90%
to the day of the injury.

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
pretty impressive.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So the use of magnetic
energy-- I mean,

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.700 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of kind
of sophisticated ways

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate it
into daily life.

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:84%
You're connected with
somebody in Nevada who

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:09.900 align:middle line:84%
does the magnetic pads, and
we were talking off camera,

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and I had one that I'd
gotten in the '90s that's

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.040 align:middle line:84%
just kind of forgot
it was even there.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
there is a difference

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:18.841 align:middle line:90%
between magnetic pads.

00:55:18.841 --> 00:55:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go into
brand names or anything,

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.120 align:middle line:84%
but you're saying
what has to happen is

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.930 align:middle line:90%
you need to have the magnets--

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Pure negative field.

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Pure negative
field packed closely together.

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And the reason for that?

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.997 align:middle line:84%
If you have them
separated, see--

00:55:34.997 --> 00:55:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we only
have a couple minutes left,

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.194 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to have
to do this in a thimble.

00:55:39.194 --> 00:55:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: All right.

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:43.860 align:middle line:84%
You can use magnets for
acupuncture treatment.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And what happens, when you get
a separation between the magnets

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.340 align:middle line:84%
like this, or you have
alternating polarities,

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.280 align:middle line:90%
which some companies, they do.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.295 align:middle line:84%
They have a positive and a
negative and a positive and a

00:55:55.295 --> 00:55:56.836 align:middle line:84%
negative, and they
go back and forth.

00:55:56.836 --> 00:55:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think
that's the one I had.

00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:58.338 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yeah.

00:55:58.338 --> 00:56:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of them do
except Dr. Bonlie's.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.620 align:middle line:84%
He's got a patented
process to where

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.880 align:middle line:84%
he creates a pure
negative field that

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.340 align:middle line:84%
works with the Earth's
gravitational field.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So it takes it from
a 0.5 to 20 Gauss,

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:17.240 align:middle line:84%
which is 40 times the Earth's
magnetic field, giving us

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:21.820 align:middle line:84%
cellular energy that allows
the body to react and function

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.370 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, doesn't your
whole electrical field also

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:26.930 align:middle line:90%
need the magnetic interface?

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:28.480 align:middle line:90%
We're an electromagnetic being.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.840 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the
Gauss field of the Earth

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:31.956 align:middle line:90%
is down to 0.5?

00:56:31.956 --> 00:56:34.180 align:middle line:84%
How are we even
thinking and functioning

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and able to find our
way through space?

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: That's exactly
why we're having all these

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:43.290 align:middle line:84%
epidemics of disease, because
we can't fight them off.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:45.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the energy
at the cellular level

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.029 align:middle line:84%
to resist a lot
of these diseases

00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:49.320 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't even hear about.

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I was also
told that this has to do with

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:55.570 align:middle line:84%
the electrical signaling
aspects of the heart,

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and also seizure activity,
which has also been increasing

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.080 align:middle line:84%
greatly, that if you have
proper magnetic support,

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.780 align:middle line:84%
then these kinds of anomalous
seizures even a lot of young

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.794 align:middle line:84%
people are having now
essentially dissipated.

00:57:07.794 --> 00:57:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.086 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:57:09.086 --> 00:57:10.751 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
sleep on this, right?

00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yes.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:12.630 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: If I may, if
anyone's interested in buying

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.030 align:middle line:90%
my book--

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we'll take them
to your website to have them do

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:19.350 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:20.141 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:57:20.141 --> 00:57:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We have just a couple
of minutes left.

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.530 align:middle line:84%
About whatever else you want to
do to tie the story together.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: OK.

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I love feeling 20 years old,
and you can't fake that.

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, when
you go from 90 to 20,

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.120 align:middle line:90%
it just blows your mind.

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so excited
about what I've

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:39.470 align:middle line:84%
been able to learn that I want
to share that with everybody,

00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:41.860 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
within everyone's ability

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to reverse their health issues
and a lot of their aging

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:45.206 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:57:45.206 --> 00:57:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:48.394 align:middle line:84%
And although we didn't
talk about it specifically,

00:57:48.394 --> 00:57:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I brought it up a couple of
times as kind of a little bait

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:52.351 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
whole cancer issue,

00:57:52.351 --> 00:57:55.380 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is, they're
finding now that molds, fungus,

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and so forth are at the
base of most cancers.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, by
cleaning up the system,

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and through these
various techniques

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.750 align:middle line:84%
that you have chronicled in
this book, a lot of people

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:05.477 align:middle line:84%
have reversed
their cancers, too.

00:58:05.477 --> 00:58:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hulda Clark has got a
book out called A Cure for All

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Cancers, A Cure for All Disease.

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And I highly recommend it.

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I've done every one
of her cleanses.

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're right.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.802 align:middle line:90%
It's excellent.

00:58:16.802 --> 00:58:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Yeah.

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:18.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's a place to start.

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.860 align:middle line:84%
You got to get rid of the
things that break down

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.110 align:middle line:84%
the immune system in order to
allow the rest of it to work.

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you've got to
stop letting the doctors tell

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:26.080 align:middle line:84%
you there's only one
way to do this thing.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD: Exactly.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.476 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
really a big part of it.

00:58:28.476 --> 00:58:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, Dennis,
I want to thank you

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.240 align:middle line:90%
so much for your time.

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.730 align:middle line:90%
You're a walking encyclopedia.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:38.450 align:middle line:84%

As always, Dennis and most of my
other guests on Healing Matrix

00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:45.690 align:middle line:90%
control of their health.

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:48.750 align:middle line:84%

to decline in its effectiveness
