00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:12.818 align:middle line:90%
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:25.636 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE MORTER: We often
hear about the importance

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:90%
of loving yourself.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:10%
And yet, in today's
image-focused world, many of us

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:10%
are left with an idea
of our self-worth

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:10%
that is based on
others' standards.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
According to our
guest today, this

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
leads us away from
our true selves

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and can cause great
psychological suffering.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Margaret Paul is a
psychologist and bestselling

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:84%
author who developed her
inner-bonding program,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:90%
30 years ago.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Inner bonding, which teaches
people to love themselves,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
has helped countless people
identify and rapidly heal

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:84%
the root cause of their pain and
learn a path to joy and loving

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.422 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:04.089 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much for
being here, Margaret.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:90%
>>MARGARET PAUL: No, thank you.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wonderful.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.497 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell us just a
little bit about your background

00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and how did you
come to your work?

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: Well, like
so many people,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in a very
dysfunctional family.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:10%
When I was five,
my mother took me

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:10%
to a psychiatrist, who
did a terrible job.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can do
a better job than him.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: At five?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, that's when I
decided to be a therapist.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And I practiced
traditionally for 17 years,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't happy.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I started
to pray for a process,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I met my best
friend Dr. Erika Chopich.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:90%
She had half of it.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I had half of it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:10%
Spirit helped put it together.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:10%
And out came inner bonding.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I've been practicing
it ever since,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and it's been life changing
for me and millions of people

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Oh, wonderful.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Now you were unsatisfied with
your traditional psychological

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:90%
therapeutic approach.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you just say a little bit
about that, what that meant?

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: First of all, there
is no spiritual aspect,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and there is really no healing
without a spiritual connection.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to access
that love in order to heal.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And traditional
psychotherapy does not

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:84%
help you take responsibility
for your feelings.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I was in all kinds of
therapy for so many years.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Nobody told me I was
responsible for my feelings.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Nobody told me how to access
a higher source of love,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom, and truth.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very different.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:90%
And this works.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
This works fast, and deep,
and people can learn it,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have to always
keep going to a therapist

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:90%
in order to be OK.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fabulous.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So I know personal
responsibility

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:90%
is scary for some people.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what that means.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.837 align:middle line:84%
So we'll definitely
be getting into,

00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
how do I make a distinction
between me being

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:84%
responsible for my own
feelings versus being

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
responsible for an entire
thing that's happening.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.843 align:middle line:90%
So we'll dig into that.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But I know that a
lot of your work

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.702 align:middle line:90%
centers on self-abandonment.

00:02:59.702 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And can you just
speak a little bit

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.078 align:middle line:84%
about what that is
for people and how

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:90%
it shows up in our lives?

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, so I
have isolated four ways

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:90%
that people abandon themselves.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.608 align:middle line:84%
One is, most of us have
learned to stay up in our head.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Because when we were little, we
couldn't manage our feelings,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:90%
and they're in the body.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:90%
So we stay up in our head.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But, like, if a child comes
to you and they're upset

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and you're just on your
computer or you're reading,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
they're going to feel abandoned.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:90%
You're not attending to them.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.228 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, it's the same
thing on the inner level.

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:90%
We have a feeling.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're on our computer,
and we're ignoring it.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a form of
self-abandonment.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:90%
We judge ourselves harshly.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
We tell ourselves things
like, I'm not good enough.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter?

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Said the wrong thing,
nobody's going to like me.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
If we treated others that
way, they would feel awful.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.615 align:middle line:84%
If we treat a child that way,
they would feel abandoned.

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And Margaret
this is huge.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Because everybody does this.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: I know.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.955 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Everybody is constantly
doing this to themselves.

00:03:53.955 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.372 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you're
saying, this is it.

00:03:56.372 --> 00:03:58.573 align:middle line:84%
This is a sign that
we are automatically

00:03:58.573 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
in that state of
self-abandonment.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: We're already
rejecting ourselves

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.898 align:middle line:90%
when we judge ourselves.

00:04:04.898 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we're
afraid that other people are

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
going to do it to us, but we've
already done it to ourselves.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.785 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Right, the worst
has already happened.

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So the third way is, we
turn to various addictions,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
we numb out our feelings--
food, alcohol, drugs, sex,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
pornography, shopping,
spending, work--

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of things,
even meditation--

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
when we're using it to
avoid responsibility

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:90%
for our feelings.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.285 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of numbing out.

00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So are these what
you would call the symptoms

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:90%
of self-abandonment?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, these are the
forms of self-abandonment.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
One more is that we make
other people responsible.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:90%
We hand over to them--

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's your fault
I'm feeling this way.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.175 align:middle line:84%
That's a form of
self-abandonment.

00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, indeed.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And usually, people
are so busy doing

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.090 align:middle line:84%
their compensatory behaviors
that they can't even

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
notice these
feelings that you're

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
describing that would be the
sure sign that I'm probably

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.475 align:middle line:90%
headed for trouble here.

00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:02.197 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, but
then they feel them,

00:05:02.197 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and they say-- they go to
a psychiatrist who says,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
take this medication and
[? no mount ?] the feelings.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to feel
anxious or depressed,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
rather than recognize that
these feelings are information

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.795 align:middle line:90%
that we're abandoning ourselves.

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So you've certainly
had lots of experience.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
You've been in practice
for a long time.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes, a long time.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you've
seen it all, I'm sure.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Right.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And we so appreciate
your bringing your wisdom here.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what, in
your perspective,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
is it that causes people
to abandon themselves

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go back
to the beginning.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:90%
How does it start?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, first of all, it's
role modeled in our families.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I never saw
my parents say, gee,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I wonder why I'm
feeling this way.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I better go inside and
see what I'm doing.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: They just
abandon themselves.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned to
do the same thing.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But also, when
we're young, there's

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things that happen.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:90%
We get hurt.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:90%
We get rejected.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of what I
call the "core, painful feelings

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:84%
of life--" the heartbreak,
the grief, the helplessness,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:90%
the loneliness.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
We can't manage those
when we're young.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't learn to
do that from our parents

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
or they're not there
for us during that time,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.185 align:middle line:84%
we have to avoid our feelings,
and so we learn to do that.

00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:18.985 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: To survive?

00:06:18.985 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.095 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, this
is very similar

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to work that I talk
about as a splat.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:90%
We just splat when we arrive.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.137 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
to deal with life.

00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what's what.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And we just do our best.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.015 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And we create this
other version of ourselves

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that is this the
survivor way of being.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I believe that you reference
it as the ego-wounded self.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak about and
define this for our viewers,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:90%
the ego-wounded self in your--

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, this
is the part of us

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
that absorbed so many false
beliefs about ourselves, what's

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:84%
wrong with us, about being able
to have control over others,

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:84%
about spirit, about
so many things.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
These false beliefs get
lodged in the lower part

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:90%
of the brain, the amygdala.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:90%
And this was our survival.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.930 align:middle line:84%
But now what happens is that
that wounded self, that's

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.425 align:middle line:90%
like this chatter back there--

00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:84%
you better be
perfect, you better

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.383 align:middle line:84%
do it right, putting
all this pressure

00:07:13.383 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:84%
on us, that's what causes so
many of these wounded feelings.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this part of
us needs healing.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to operate
out of these false beliefs.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's all based in
survivorship and protectivism,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, this part of
us just wants to control--

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%
wants to control how
people feel about us,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:84%
wants to control our feelings,
wants to control outcomes--

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.035 align:middle line:84%
doesn't realize that that's
not a very good idea.

00:07:38.035 --> 00:07:39.365 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Trying to create safety.

00:07:39.365 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.227 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I mean, it's reasonable
that people are doing this,

00:07:43.227 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:90%
but it's just not going to work.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.102 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't work
in the long run.

00:07:46.102 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: No, it may have worked
a little bit as we were growing

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:90%
up, but now it's the opposite.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.613 align:middle line:90%
It makes us feel awful.

00:07:52.613 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then,
speaking of growing up,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:84%
you also speak about
this adult self, this

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
loving adult. Can you lay
that out for our viewers

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
so that we can start
to get this idea,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, I have this part of me
that's trying to control things

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and is worried and trying to
avoid the pain, et cetera,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.697 align:middle line:84%
and then there's, apparently,
this other part of me that's

00:08:10.697 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.072 align:middle line:84%
And can you just
define this for us?

00:08:14.072 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, so
the loving adult--

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
see, in inner bonding,
there's two intentions.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
One is the intention to
control, and the other

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
is the intention to learn about
loving ourselves and sharing

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:90%
our love.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:84%
The loving adult is who we are
when we're in that intention

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to learn about love,
and we're connected

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:90%
to a higher source of love.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
And so then, this
is the part of us

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:90%
that takes loving action for us.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Rather than wanting to get love
and avoid pain, this part of us

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:84%
learns to love ourselves and
share our love with others.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So does this
loving adult, then,

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.470 align:middle line:84%
observe these other
behaviors and just say,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not going
to bite into that?

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
something else instead.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to learn
something that I

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.855 align:middle line:84%
didn't know about myself, and
my self-worth, and my OKness.

00:09:00.855 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, the loving
adult is the part of us

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that learns to get
inside the body,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
becomes aware of these
wounded feelings like anxiety

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
or depression, and then does
the inner bonding process

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
to explore, well, how
am I treating myself?

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:90%
What am I telling myself?

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
That's causing this,
and then learning

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
to go to our higher
guidance for,

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.160 align:middle line:84%
what's the truth about these
beliefs, and what loving action

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:84%
can I take, and then
takes the action.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Boy, you're
singing my song.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely love this
conversation truly.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back
just a little bit

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to what are some of the
results of self-abandonment

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:90%
on one's self?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
What happens here within
once that is happening?

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, I mean,
obviously, we're stressed,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and stress causes
a lot of illness.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So illness can be
one of the results.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the anxiety,
the depression, unhappiness,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:90%
stress--

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:90%
we just feel bad.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:90%
We get stuck.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:90%
We can't manifest well.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
We're in a low frequency, what
I call "low frequency," when

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
we're abandoning ourselves,
and that's just not a fun way

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
to live.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And plus, it has a horrible
effect on relationships.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, that was going
to be my next question.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
What impact does that roll
out into the relationships

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
of our lives if we're not
home to ourselves, and feeling

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:84%
afraid, and
compensating for that?

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
How does that get projected onto
relationships and what happens?

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, the
problem is that we

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:84%
attracted our common level of
self-love or self abandonment.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we're
abandoning ourselves,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
we're going to attract somebody
who's abandoning themselves.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Then, we're getting into the
relationship to get love.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Rather than to learn,
to grow, and share love,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:90%
we want to get love.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, when two people get into
a relationship to get love,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:90%
it's a disaster.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
It never works.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Because you're always
blaming the other person

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
for not loving you in the
way that you want to be loved

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
rather than learning to
bring that into yourself

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and share that
with your partner.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So I've been working with
couples for over 50 years,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and this is the main
issue is self-abandonment.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And when people learn to love,
and see, and value themselves,

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:84%
define their own worth
instead of saying, well, you

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:84%
have to love me for me to be OK,
I mean, this is a huge issue--

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
that I need your approval
in order for me to be OK.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's like trying to
fill an unfillable hole.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.195 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:11:22.195 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a bottomless pit.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And it causes
a lot of conflict

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:90%
that never gets resolved.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So tell us a little
bit about your inner bonding

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:90%
program itself.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, like I said, I
was unhappy with the therapy,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and I just started to
pray for a process,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.788 align:middle line:84%
and spirit brought
it in, actually.

00:11:38.788 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, so then
shows up in your life,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
you guys start talking, you
put this program together?

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Right.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so step one is getting
present in your body

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
with your feelings and wanting
responsibility for them.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And step two is that
you move into your heart

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and you make a decision
to be open to learning

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:90%
rather than trying to control.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And you learn to
open to bringing

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:84%
in the love and compassion
of your higher guidance

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
generate compassion.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:90%
We open to it.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And then step three
is, we dialogue,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:90%
like with a child who's upset.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
We say, what's
the matter, honey?

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that I'm doing?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:90%
We do that with ourselves.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:90%
What am I telling you?

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:84%
How am I treating you that's
causing you to feel this way?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, we go deeper
into the ego-wounded self.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Why are you putting pressure?

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Why are you judging?

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Why are you avoiding
the feelings?

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:90%
What is your belief?

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
uncover the false beliefs.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Step four, we learn to go
to our higher guidance,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and I teach people how to do
this, and we ask two questions.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
What is the truth about any
of the beliefs that I've

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:90%
uncovered?

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:90%
And what is loving to me?

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:90%
What's the loving action?

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:90%
What's in my highest good?

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Step five is, we do
it, we take the action.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And step six, we tune
in, and we see how

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%
we feel as a result of that.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we indeed are
loving ourselves,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.060 align:middle line:90%
we will feel a lot of relief.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What are you
wanting to teach people

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.657 align:middle line:90%
by this whole process first?

00:13:07.657 --> 00:13:10.157 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to ask you some
questions about the process.

00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:84%
But what's the overarching
thing that you want them

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:90%
to glean from the inner body--

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: You know, what I
really want them to get

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.060 align:middle line:90%
is how incredible they are.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I want them to know who
they are in their soul.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.828 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: To learn
their magnificence.

00:13:22.828 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, I mean, we are
so incredible in our soul.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't been
mirrored by our parents.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And unless we learn to
access our higher guidance,

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to get
it from other people.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But as we learn to access the
truth from our higher guidance,

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
we learn to see who we are, and
we learn to act from that soul

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
instead of from
that wounded mind.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.566 align:middle line:84%
That makes all the
difference in the world.

00:13:50.566 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm-hm.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So can you take us
through the steps,

00:13:54.430 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:84%
again, just to allow this to
have real clarity for people.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Because we're living
at a time where there's

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of conversation
about, you need

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:84%
to find your limiting
beliefs, and get rid of them,

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and establish better
beliefs in their place.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And people are like, OK,
I have to go do that.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And many people do not
know how to do that.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:90%
And I love what you just shared.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.685 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love for you to walk us
through it step by step again.

00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: OK, so let's say
that you're feeling anxious,

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and you tune in,
oh, I feel tight

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
because lots of times feelings
show up physically in the body,

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
so the stomach is tighter
or the chest is tight.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:90%
There's a tightness in the body.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your neck or
your back is tight.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you might
say, OK, I'm anxious.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:90%
You breathe in in step one.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.265 align:middle line:84%
You use your breath to take
you inside and get present.

00:14:45.265 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like sitting with
a child who's hurting.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And so then, in step two,
we breathe into our heart.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:84%
We consciously open to learning
about loving ourselves.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:90%
It has to start with ourselves.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of
us are caretakers.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:84%
We focus on loving
the other person.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Totally.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.232 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: We get lost in here.

00:15:05.232 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we're doing
that, we're actually

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
trying to get love, rather
than love ourselves first.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
We have to fill ourselves
with love first.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Excellent.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.990 align:middle line:10%
So first step is--

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: First step is
get present in your body

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:10%
and with your feelings.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I'm feeling
this thing, frahhh,

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come in
here and breathe with it.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: And breathe with it.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Step two?

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Step two,
open to learning.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Oh, I gotta open to
learning instead of jumping

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:90%
to protecting myself.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I'm going to just open.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Proetcting,
avoiding, controlling.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: OK, I could knee-jerk
into it, but I'm not going to.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I'm going to breathe.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: I'm going
to open to learning.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I'm going to
be open to learning.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: --about loving myself.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.625 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And loving myself.

00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, and then we invite
spirit in simply by saying,

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I invite in love and compassion.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Is that part of step two?

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah, part of step two.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.863 align:middle line:84%
Open to learning, I invite
in love and compassion.

00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Inviting in higher power.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Right, so
then step three,

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking this part
of me that's anxious,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:90%
what am I telling you?

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:84%
How am I treating you
that's causing this?

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, I go inside and I let
the answer come from inside.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So we can call this the
inner child, the soul self,

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
the essence, the feeling
self, whatever you want.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The one who
got left behind.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:90%
We know that for sure.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.587 align:middle line:84%
So then that part
might say, well, you're

00:16:14.587 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:90%
putting all this pressure on me.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.503 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me I
got to be perfect.

00:16:17.503 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:90%
I have to do everything right.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:90%
I better not make a mistake.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got to
like me or I'm not OK.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds
of things we do.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: But we're listening
for what are we doing.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we're putting a
lot of pressure on ourselves

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and telling ourselves, we've
got to do everything right.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Then, we go a
little deeper and we

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
ask that wounded
part of ourselves,

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:90%
why are you doing this?

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Why are you putting
on this pressure?

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And the wounded self might
say, well, this is the only way

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that I can get approval,
and I need approval

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:90%
in order to be OK.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
This will give me control.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:84%
If I do everything
right, I can have

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
control over how other
people feel about me.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a very deep belief
for a lot of people.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.388 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: So then
once you understand

00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing,
then step four,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.560 align:middle line:84%
you open to learning with
your higher guidance.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
And opening to learning about
love raises the frequency.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you're eating
well and your body's

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
in a high enough
frequency, you can actually

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:84%
access that
information and spirit.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:90%
It's always here for us.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
But most people don't
know how to access it.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
And so they were asking,
well, what's the truth?

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Can I really control how
people feel about me?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
If I do everything
right, do I have control

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:90%
over how people feel about me?

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you're tuned
in, your guidance says,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
do people have control over
how you feel about them?

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Or do you decide
that all by yourself?

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.040 align:middle line:84%
No, actually, you don't
have that control.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
You're working really
hard for nothing.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, it can't be done.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Can't be done.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And so then we say, what
would be loving to me?

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.610 align:middle line:90%
And we access that.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And so what spirit might say
is, get yourself off the hook.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Tell yourself it's
OK to make a mistake.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to be human.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I tell myself all the
time, hey, make mistakes,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
fall on your face, fail, I'm
going to love you anyway.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: It's OK.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And that lets me
be relaxed about things.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, so we have
a video of you leading

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
a woman through the
steps of inner bonding

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:90%
at one of your workshops, yes?

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.352 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Let's take a look.

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: OK.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:10%
So what's really
happening here is

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:10%
that you learned so long
ago to try and take care

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:10%
of everybody else to get love.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:10%
But in doing that, you're
abandoning your little girl,

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:10%
and she's feeling
unloved by you.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.450 align:middle line:10%
And that's why she's hurting.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.968 align:middle line:10%
She's feeling unloved.

00:18:42.968 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And I don't know
how to lover her.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: Right.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.797 align:middle line:10%
You don't know how to love her.

00:18:46.797 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:10%
You know how to take
care of everybody else,

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:10%
but you don't know how
to love her, right?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.725 align:middle line:10%
>> No, because I don't
think she's good.

00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:53.600 align:middle line:10%
You know what I mean?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.895 align:middle line:10%
I tell myself all the
time, I'm not good enough.

00:18:55.895 --> 00:18:56.695 align:middle line:10%
I'm not--

00:18:56.695 --> 00:18:59.360 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: Oh, OK, so there's
one of the false beliefs.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm not good enough.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.820 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: I want you to ask
god if that's at all true,

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:10%
if there's any way that it
could be true, that who you are

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:10%
and your soul is
not good enough.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:10%


00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.780 align:middle line:10%
>> He thinks I'm good enough.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so who are you
going to believe?

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
You're going to believe your
four-year-old wounded self who

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.408 align:middle line:84%
decided you weren't good enough
or you're going to believe God?

00:19:29.408 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm going to believe God.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: OK, good.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Now ask God, what's
the first thing

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that I need to do for
my little girl for her

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:84%
to start to feel
my love for her?

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:10%
What's one thing?

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:10%
What would be one thing?

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.121 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.044 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: OK, if you
had a little girl--

00:19:58.044 --> 00:19:59.100 align:middle line:10%
do you have children?

00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: OK.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:10%
And do you have a little girl?

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.808 align:middle line:10%
Or did you have a girl?

00:20:03.808 --> 00:20:04.685 align:middle line:10%
>> She's 23.

00:20:04.685 --> 00:20:05.210 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: OK.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:10%
>> She's always going
to be my little girl.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: OK.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:10%
So when she was little and
she came to you hurting,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:10%
what would you do?

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.265 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd hug her, love her.

00:20:12.265 --> 00:20:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: That's right.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:90%
So the first thing--

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
to get yourself a doll or a
stuffed animal and hug her,

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.230 align:middle line:84%
the same thing you
would do with a child.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:31.162 align:middle line:84%
Just hug her and let her
know that she's not alone.

00:20:31.162 --> 00:20:32.745 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what you
do with your kids?

00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:33.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: You let them know
you were there, right?

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: So you know
how to do that, right?

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:10%
>> I hope I do.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah, well you did.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I can see that you did.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, I love her to death.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, I can
see that you did.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And you held them?

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I didn't want to
leave the same prints.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:51.975 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah, that's right.

00:20:51.975 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think you did.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But your child needs the same
thing as you gave your kids.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:84%
She needs you to
hug her and let her

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
know you're there, she's not
alone, and that she's good.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: [SIGH] Beautiful.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Thank you.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what are the
results for one's self going

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.512 align:middle line:90%
through inner body?

00:21:13.512 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: You know, the results
are absolutely amazing.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:10%
We have a sense of freedom.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:10%
We don't feel alone inside.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Our creativity soars.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer
afraid of intimacy.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, so many people
are afraid of rejection.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of
losing the other person.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of
losing themselves.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But when we develop
a loving adult,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
we don't give ourselves
up, so we're no longer

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:90%
afraid of losing ourselves.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't take
rejection personally

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
rejecting ourselves.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And so our relationships
improve so much.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
We're able to manifest our
dreams because we're operating

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:90%
from a much higher frequency.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
We're operating out of
love and out of truth

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:90%
rather than out of fear.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is what enables us to
be creative and manifest what

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:90%
we want in our lives.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.970 align:middle line:90%
My life has changed like--

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I can't even tell you how
much my life has changed

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:90%
from learning to love myself.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:90%
It's just absolutely amazing.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:90%
This is where joy is.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.555 align:middle line:90%
This is where peace is.

00:22:20.555 --> 00:22:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And sometimes
people who haven't

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:84%
been able to be self-loving,
they would feel they're

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:84%
being selfish if
they're not continuing

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
to be the caretaker,
or the do-gooder,

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
or they make-it-worker
kind of person.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
for people to realize

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:90%
that you're not being selfish.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:90%
You're being self-responsible.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
It's responsible stewardship
to reclaim our power,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
to choose our felt
sensations, our feelings,

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:90%
our dispositions in the world.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: Well, and to become
more loving human beings

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Selfishness is actually when
we're expecting other people

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:84%
to give themselves up
and take care of us,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
rather than taking
responsibility for ourselves.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And selfishness is when we
don't care about the effect

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
our behavior has
on other people,

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and that's never loving to us.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:84%
When we love
ourselves, we deeply

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.010 align:middle line:84%
care about the effect our
behavior has on others.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not a, well, I'm just
going to take care of me,

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.155 align:middle line:90%
and I don't care about you.

00:23:19.155 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not that at all.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:90%
That's not loving to ourselves.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, I think
that's important

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
when people are
trying to navigate

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:84%
a new distinction for
themselves, that it's not

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:90%
all or nothing.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's
not about you at all.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying, it needs
to be about me, too,

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and then managing
that effectively.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:84%
What are one of the
most empowering things

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
for relationships that comes
from inner bonding work?

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, what happens
with people when they're

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:84%
taking responsibility
for themselves

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.770 align:middle line:90%
is that they get to share love.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, their sex life improves.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with people who
haven't had sex for years.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And as they start
to love themselves,

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.650 align:middle line:84%
they start to be able to see
the beauty in the other person.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:84%
What happens in so
many relationships

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
is that they fall
in love with who

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.920 align:middle line:90%
they are in their core essence.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course, the
wounded self takes over,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and nobody likes
anybody's wounded self.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the relationship
goes downhill.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But as they learn
to see who they are,

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:84%
they also learn to see who
the other person is and learn

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:84%
to value the essence
in the other person

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and to share love
from that perspective.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:90%
They start to have fun.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:90%
They start to play.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:84%
They're able to learn
and grow together,

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.672 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the great
things about relationships.

00:24:37.672 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I've just worked
with people who've

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:84%
been married for
a very long time,

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and they thought
that it was over.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But if even just one person
decides to love themselves,

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:84%
the whole system shifts and
everything can get better.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.832 align:middle line:90%
Can't guarantee it.

00:24:53.832 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes when
you love yourself,

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
the other person says, oh, I
just want to be taken care of

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
or I just want to be in control,
and the relationship's over,

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be
willing to take that risk.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
it gets so much better.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, I think this is
comforting for our viewers

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to hear, that you might
think it's over, doesn't have

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:84%
to be over, and
if it is over, it

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:84%
will be OK because it's
what's meant to be.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.078 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
better sense of self

00:25:20.078 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to navigate
something like that.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah,
everything changes when

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:84%
you stop trying to
control the other person.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Control is a big thing
in relationships,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and nobody likes
to be controlled.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And people create this system--

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
one person is trying to control,
the other is giving themselves

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
up, and then angry about it
or resisting and withdrawing,

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and then the other
person feels rejected.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:90%
That just doesn't work.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It just goes
back and forth.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.258 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah, back and forth.

00:25:45.258 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And so when you stop
trying to control

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and you learn to
love yourself, you

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.533 align:middle line:84%
don't want to control once
you're loving yourself.

00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:90%
You just want to share love.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This is a
seven-day course, right?

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: It's a
seven-day course, right?

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can take it.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.888 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That's a
very comprehensive,

00:25:59.888 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:84%
complimentary program that
you're offering to the world.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: I want everybody
to be doing this.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:90%
I want the world to be happy.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I think I know the
answer to this question,

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.486 align:middle line:84%
but I have to ask
it for our viewers.

00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Who should take this course?

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Who would benefit
from inner bonding?

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah, everybody.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there isn't
anybody that doesn't

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:90%
have pain in their lives.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anybody that's
not abandoning themselves

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:90%
in some ways.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So everybody can benefit
from learning inner bonding.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:29.045 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now you have a
book about inner bonding.

00:26:29.045 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about this?

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.045 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Yeah, so "The
Inner Bonding Workbook"

00:26:32.045 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:90%
is the last book that I wrote.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.750 align:middle line:10%
If people work
through that, they're

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:10%
going to be amazed at what
happens in their lives.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.370 align:middle line:90%
This whole book was channeled.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:40.912 align:middle line:84%
I brought it through
from the spirit.

00:26:40.912 --> 00:26:41.795 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Oh, beautiful.

00:26:41.795 --> 00:26:42.996 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yeah.

00:26:42.996 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We have, joining
us on Skype, one of Dr.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.200 align:middle line:10%
Paul's long-term clients
and close friend--

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:10%
motivational speaker,
best-selling author,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:10%
and dear friend of mine
as well, Marci Schimoff.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.855 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, Marci.

00:26:54.855 --> 00:26:57.605 align:middle line:10%
>>MARCI SCHIMOFF: Hi, great
to be with both of you.

00:26:57.605 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: We're absolutely thrilled
to have you here with us today.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for taking the time

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to speak with us
about Margaret's

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.102 align:middle line:90%
program and your work.

00:27:08.102 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with
us how you first

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:90%
came to connect with Margaret?

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.768 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHIMOFF: Actually, it
was probably 40 years ago

00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:90%
that I heard of Margaret.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I was living in the same city in
California, and I went to her--

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.383 align:middle line:84%
I think Margaret was probably my
first therapist that I went to,

00:27:25.383 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
but I only lived there
for a short time,

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:90%
so that was short lived.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:90%
But I loved her work.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, more recently
in the last 10 years,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I've become very familiar
with the inner bonding work,

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and I actually invited her
to work with these groups

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that I work with,
these groups of women

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that I work with in
Living a Miraculous Life,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:90%
and Margaret has been fantastic.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Her program has just truly
impacted so many people

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.285 align:middle line:84%
that I actually said,
OK, I gotta do this.

00:27:52.285 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:84%
If they're getting that
much benefit from it,

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:90%
I better try this.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to see what
they're having.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've used this now in my own
life for probably five years.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:90%
It's been life-changing.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with
us a little bit

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
about your own personal
experience with inner bonding

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.136 align:middle line:90%
and what has unfolded for you?

00:28:12.136 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHIMOFF: Yes, absolutely.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So I have, historically,
throughout my life, been

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:90%
a great controller of life.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I thought that everything
that was going to happen,

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.025 align:middle line:84%
if it was going
to happen, it was

00:28:24.025 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:84%
gonna happen through my effort,
my control, my hanging on,

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
my pushing through,
and I like to say

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
that I used to feel like
I was the general manager

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was the only way that
things were going to work.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
actually, I've been

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:84%
able to manifest a
good amount of success.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But with that, there was always
a lot of anxiety and not as

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
much fulfillment as you
would expect from having

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:90%
that kind of success.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:90%
And there was this disconnect.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I started feeling like,
I want to see if I can--

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:90%
how life is a different way.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And Margaret really, the
inner bonding process

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
is, for me, the biggest
antidote to living

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.830 align:middle line:84%
a life of controlling because
it's really about bonding

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.820 align:middle line:90%
with my higher self.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I've learned to hear the
old patterns, the old voices,

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:84%
the voices of the wounded child,
and shift to listening more

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.070 align:middle line:84%
to my divine connection,
my sense of my higher self,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:90%
I actually let go more.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And miraculously, more
good stuff happens.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.270 align:middle line:84%
More magic happens in
that letting-go space.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Plus, I feel better.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.425 align:middle line:84%
So it's a much more
fulfilling kind of a flow.

00:29:50.425 --> 00:29:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, it's so
challenging, Marci,

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:57.220 align:middle line:84%
for people such as yourself
because you are very bright,

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and you do have a lot of
capacity to make things work.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we figure, if I can
make things work by operating

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.650 align:middle line:84%
this way, if I do
it more, they'll

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.400 align:middle line:84%
even work better or more
things will work in my favor.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's this point
where that's not the case.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And so how would you share that
your inner feeling has changed,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:84%
your relationship with
self has changed as you,

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
in those moments, decide to
take your foot off the gas

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:90%
and trust a higher power?

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:34.825 align:middle line:90%
What happens for you?

00:30:34.825 --> 00:30:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHIMOFF: Yeah, so
it's really interesting

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:41.470 align:middle line:84%
because I've actually always
had a fairly clear connection

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
to my higher self,
but I just haven't

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
been in a pattern, the
habit of going there.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like a well-worn groove.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the groove
of going to the fear,

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:90%
the anxiety, the pressure.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:90%
And now, I notice it.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.570 align:middle line:90%
That's the very first thing.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I notice, oh, that's
where I'm going.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And rather than going, uh, I'm
going there again and beating

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:10.870 align:middle line:84%
myself up, I just relax
and I go, OK, let me just--

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.980 align:middle line:84%
let me shift, and let
me go to my higher

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:90%
self, my divine connection.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And everything
inside just shifts.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm not perfect.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:84%
What it is it's a matter
of creating new habits.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And the inner bonding process
is such a brilliant way

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of helping create
those new habits.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you,
probably the person

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that's the happiest that I'm
doing this-- besides myself

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and my own experience--
is my partner, Sergio,

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:84%
who, in our relationship, I
have been very, very, very

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:90%
controlling.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that I don't
still go towards that pattern,

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.540 align:middle line:90%
but I'm very aware of it.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I am,
I take a breath,

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I check in with my
body, I do this process,

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I take responsibility
for how I'm feeling,

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and I connect in
to my higher self.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a difference
in how life happens.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a difference in
my inner experience.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a difference
in what manifests

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.950 align:middle line:84%
both in my relationship
and in my work.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
Sue, you are also

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary embodiment
of living this way.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.680 align:middle line:84%
As some people
will probably know,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Sue and I actually co-lead
a program together called

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.250 align:middle line:90%
"Your Year of Miracles."

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's about living
a miraculous life.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen this
process of inner bonding

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.980 align:middle line:84%
with myself, have such an
effect on how I show up

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
in that program and how
the decisions that I

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:84%
make, the choices, they come
from a much more connected

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm having many
more of these sort of downloads,

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.270 align:middle line:84%
rather than pushing
and pressuring.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I thank you, Margaret, so
much for the great blessing

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:90%
of your work.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you, Sue,
so much, for living

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:84%
in this way to
such a great degree

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:84%
yourself because you're both
such an inspiration to me.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Oh, well,
thank you, Marci.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a great, great joy.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to go back just
a second here and connect with,

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:84%
just to share with people,
how do you catch yourself

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:90%
in the moment?

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:32.670 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it something you say,
or something you do,

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:37.420 align:middle line:84%
or something you feel,
so that our viewers can

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:84%
have an idea of, hey,
I want what she's got.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to have what
Marci's been describing,

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:84%
what Margaret's been
teaching, and what

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.528 align:middle line:84%
you're sharing about
how we're operating,

00:33:48.528 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:90%
I want to have that, too.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:53.530 align:middle line:84%
How do I know how to
interrupt what I've been doing

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.456 align:middle line:90%
so that I can start doing this?

00:33:56.456 --> 00:33:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHIMOFF: Well, the very
first step is feeling your body.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know when my body
is tight that I'm probably

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:84%
telling myself something that
is not kind of loving to myself.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:90%
So I just, I listen to my body.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that,
[GASP],, anxiety,

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
or that shortness of breath, or
that holding starts to happen,

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I go, OK, what's going on here?

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:26.339 align:middle line:84%
And the body is the pathway
in to knowing when something's

00:34:26.339 --> 00:34:27.139 align:middle line:90%
a little bit off.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:27.939 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:34:27.939 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHIMOFF: And so I just
stop, and I feel that,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and I go, OK, what
am I telling myself?

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.929 align:middle line:90%
And then I shift to--

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I do the practice, the
process that Margaret teaches.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, wonderful.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Who would you recommend
take Margaret's work?

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Who would you refer to Margaret?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:84%
What do you
recommend for people?

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHIMOFF: Well, I
can't imagine that it

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't work for everybody.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.699 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an extremely
universal process,

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be somebody
who's actually wants

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.080 align:middle line:90%
to make a shift in their life.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So, obviously, you can't
force change upon anybody.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:90%
It has to come from within.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But anybody who's
struggling, I think,

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:84%
in any area of their
life, whether it's

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.570 align:middle line:84%
with their relationship,
or with their work,

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:84%
or with their own
sense of self-love.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:90%
I used to teach self esteem.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this
work on self-love

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:90%
is such a deeper place.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Self esteem is about
getting approval.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:90%
It's about liking yourself.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.840 align:middle line:84%
But self-love and this work is
such a deeper, deeper process.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.370 align:middle line:84%
It's also for anybody
who has challenges,

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I think, with their
help, with their body,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.070 align:middle line:90%
with their eating patterns.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed differences in
this with my own relationship

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:90%
with food.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen it work
with so many people

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.540 align:middle line:84%
that I've shared it with, so
I think it's quite universal.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.940 align:middle line:84%
What would you say is
the most profound piece

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of Margaret's work?

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:59.582 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.582 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHIMOFF: I mean, the
whole process, I think,

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.410 align:middle line:84%
works together, but ultimately,
for me, the most profound piece

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is connecting to our
connecting to our higher self.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:12.140 align:middle line:90%
That's where all the juices.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.390 align:middle line:90%
That's where the miracles are.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.040 align:middle line:90%
That's where the magic is.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And this process
allows that to happen.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every
year, as you know,

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Sue, I pick a
theme for the year.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It's part of your Year
of Miracles program.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And my theme this year
is divine connection.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it's all about
connection to my higher self.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:35.090 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:37.825 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
juice really is in life.

00:36:37.825 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Marci, for your thoughts,

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:46.750 align:middle line:84%
your sharing, your deep
sharing with us today.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It means so much to
all of our viewers

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hear
that even people

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.280 align:middle line:84%
with tremendous successes
have the same issues

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that everyone else has,
that everyone on the planet

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle line:84%
is really here to
learn how to self-love.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for your
time in sharing with us--

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Can I say
one thing here?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Marci, I so honor
you for your courage.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Because you're one of those
people who have been very, very

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.700 align:middle line:84%
successful through the pushing,
through the controlling.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think it takes so much
courage to actually let go.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know that for so
many people, it's hard.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, I've succeeded this way.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Why should I let go?

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But you decided you didn't
want to feel the anxiety,

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and you've taken the risk,
and you're letting go.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just so
honor you for that.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHIMOFF: Thank you, Margaret.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
helping guide that because,

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:84%
truly, being the general
manager of the universe

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.910 align:middle line:90%
is not that much fun.

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.582 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:45.582 --> 00:37:47.576 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You can
take some time off.

00:37:47.576 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHIMOFF: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You can take a vacation.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being with us, Marci.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.510 align:middle line:90%
We're blessed to have you.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHIMOFF: Thank you.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.125 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is phenomenal, and
such a testament to your work,

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and certainly
something that I know

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.050 align:middle line:84%
will help our viewers
around the world.

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.502 align:middle line:84%
So a beautiful, beautiful
connection that you have there.

00:38:10.502 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes, thank you.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And Marci has been
a dear friend in my life.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.122 align:middle line:10%
And I hear your work
come through her

00:38:17.122 --> 00:38:19.080 align:middle line:10%
when she's working with
the thousands of people

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:10%
around the world that we're
speaking with every month

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.830 align:middle line:10%
and asking them, what's the
most loving thing that you could

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.350 align:middle line:10%
do for yourself in this moment?

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
beautiful reflection

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.822 align:middle line:90%
of what you're passing down.

00:38:29.822 --> 00:38:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long time
you've been putting

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:33.570 align:middle line:84%
this work together,
and it's going out

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:84%
into the world in
all kinds of ways.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.230 align:middle line:90%
So wonderful.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So you speak about
energy frequency

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:84%
as well, which is another topic
very near and dear to my heart.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:84%
What can you share with us about
how you came to explore that?

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, there came a
period of time in my life where

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I knew--

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.580 align:middle line:84%
see, I was raised
by atheist parents.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I was a spiritual kid,
but they didn't help that.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, I knew
there was something there,

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
how to access it.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:90%
When I was in my early '20s--

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I had been a sickly kid.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And so in my early '20s, I
started reading about health,

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and I changed everything,
threw everything out,

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.520 align:middle line:84%
started eating just
organic everything.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.730 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to
tapes, how to connect,

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't get there.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Then, inner bonding came in.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And I understood
about the intention

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.140 align:middle line:90%
to learn about loving myself.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I had
that connection.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it was
about the intention

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.160 align:middle line:90%
to learn about loving myself.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So I started to teach
my clients about that.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Didn't work.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, I realized it's
both the energy in your body,

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that you have to be eating
clean you can't be putting junk

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.840 align:middle line:84%
food in and have
a high frequency,

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be open to
learning about loving yourself.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's the magic.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And when people are doing
both, their frequency

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:84%
is high enough to access
their higher guidance.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.195 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:40:01.195 --> 00:40:01.995 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected.

00:40:01.995 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: It's all connected.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interconnected.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.647 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Right, that's right.

00:40:04.647 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: So tell us about
this book as well,

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.900 align:middle line:10%
your "Diet for
Divine Connection,"

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:10%
which is yet another
one of your works

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:10%
that are serving people
around the world.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.600 align:middle line:10%
What can you tell us about it?

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.058 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: Yeah, so the subtitle
is "Beyond Junk Food and Junk

00:40:20.058 --> 00:40:22.433 align:middle line:10%
Thoughts To At-Will
Divine Connection."

00:40:22.433 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what it's about.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.330 align:middle line:84%
The first part is about food,
and I teach people a lot.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend
a particular diet

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.510 align:middle line:84%
because everybody's got
their own philosophy.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:35.790 align:middle line:84%
But I do teach people how to
find out what's right for them

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:90%
and to eat clean, organic food.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:39.863 align:middle line:90%
That's so essential.

00:40:39.863 --> 00:40:41.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
part of the book.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The second part
teaches inner bonding.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So we can't be putting
junk foods in our body,

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and we can't be putting the junk
thoughts from our wounded self

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and expect to be able to
connect to our guidance.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Our frequency is too low.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And frequency
is like if you

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:84%
walk into a room of angry
people, that's a low frequency.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.210 align:middle line:84%
You walk into a room of
loving people, that's

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:90%
a high frequency.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.620 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the energy of that.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I just turned 80 this year.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.630 align:middle line:90%
So I know that all this works.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.660 align:middle line:84%
It works when you're eating
really well, all organic.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:84%
It works when you
get enough exercise.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And it works when you're
staying tuned into your feelings

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and taking
responsibility for them

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.915 align:middle line:84%
so that you're peaceful,
not anxious and depressed.

00:41:25.915 --> 00:41:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I just have
to back up here.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.788 align:middle line:84%
80 years old, and you are
vital, you are flourishing,

00:41:31.788 --> 00:41:33.455 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you're
just getting started.

00:41:33.455 --> 00:41:34.455 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: [LAUGHS] I know.

00:41:34.455 --> 00:41:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're an amazing
little skyrocket here.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I would think
that people would

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.010 align:middle line:84%
want to listen to what
you have to say about--

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Well, I hope so.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
tell people my age

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:84%
because I want them
to be inspired.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to get decrepit.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
lose your energy

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.040 align:middle line:84%
if you are willing to take
responsibility physically,

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.495 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:41:54.495 --> 00:41:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So where does the idea of
self-worth fit into your work?

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: Well, that's exactly
what I was just referring to.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It's basic.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:05.220 align:middle line:90%
It's basic.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to go
to our higher guidance

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.856 align:middle line:84%
and we learn to define our
own worth intrinsically--

00:42:10.856 --> 00:42:13.560 align:middle line:84%
see, unfortunately, so many
people define their worth

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.440 align:middle line:84%
by how they look and
by their performance,

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:84%
by their achievements, by
externals and by other people's

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:20.730 align:middle line:90%
approval.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But when you learn to tap
into your higher guidance,

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:84%
you learn to define yourself
intrinsically, who you are--

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.560 align:middle line:84%
your kindness, your caring, your
compassion, your creativity,

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.710 align:middle line:84%
your particular form
of intelligence,

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:84%
your honesty, your
loyalty, there's

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.930 align:middle line:90%
so many intrinsic qualities.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And we each have our own gifts.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.720 align:middle line:10%
And there's another issue
here that's dear to my heart,

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:10%
and that is the whole issue of
what's happening to our climate

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:49.530 align:middle line:10%
change.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.680 align:middle line:90%


00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.880 align:middle line:84%
We treat our planet the
way we treat ourselves.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.270 align:middle line:90%
We're junking up ourselves.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.437 align:middle line:90%
We're junking up our planet.

00:42:59.437 --> 00:43:00.237 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:43:00.237 --> 00:43:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: We're going to treat
the outer terrain the way

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we're treating
the inner terrain.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's so important,
if we want this planet

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:90%
to heal, to heal ourselves.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.905 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's all one thing.

00:43:10.905 --> 00:43:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: It's all one thing.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:middle line:84%
If we're to have that
spiritual guidance,

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.800 align:middle line:84%
we're connecting
to the universe,

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.730 align:middle line:84%
we have to recognize that we
are a presence of the universe.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And as such, we then are
able to care about things

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:26.550 align:middle line:84%
other than our
own survival, then

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:84%
can care about the
planet and others.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Yes.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.985 align:middle line:84%
How can people learn more
about you and your work?

00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:35.990 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL: Well, they can go to
the website at innerbonding.com.

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.960 align:middle line:10%
That's where they can
get the free course.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's many other
courses that I teach.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I work with people.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I have facilitators.

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.080 align:middle line:84%
We have a fabulous
facilitior training program,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.190 align:middle line:90%
so there's many facilitators.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I teach workshops and
five-day intensives,

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.350 align:middle line:90%
three-day intensives.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I have many books
that people can read.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.890 align:middle line:90%
There's many, many ways.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But if they go on
the website, there's

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:84%
thousands of articles
they can read.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.100 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
ways to get help.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.753 align:middle line:84%
A wealth of information and a
lifetime of flourishing work.

00:44:07.753 --> 00:44:08.670 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL: And we have a fantastic
program called "Self Quest,"

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.460 align:middle line:84%
which, if people like
to work on the computer,

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.940 align:middle line:84%
it will teach them this process
in a very, very in-depth way.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Oh, beautiful.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Margaret,
for being with us today.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: You're so welcome.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.508 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's been a wonderful,
wonderful of connection

00:44:26.508 --> 00:44:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and hearing your great
understanding of what

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.900 align:middle line:84%
it takes to live a
life uncommon, truly,

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.490 align:middle line:90%
connected, inner bonding.

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.245 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL: Thank you so much.

00:44:37.245 --> 00:44:39.900 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Dr. Margaret
Paul's work is a testament

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:10%
to just how essential
it is for each of us

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.240 align:middle line:10%
to create profound
connections with ourselves,

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.350 align:middle line:10%
with spirit, and with others
by tuning into our true worth

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.290 align:middle line:10%
and living from a place of
self-love, a place where

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:55.050 align:middle line:10%
real healing can occur.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:90%
