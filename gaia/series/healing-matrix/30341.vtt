00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Dr. Gerald Cohen

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:84%
has been on a lifelong quest
to find the most leading edge

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
modalities for assisting in the
healing process of his clients.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.660 align:middle line:84%
He's recently
discovered what he feels

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
is a breakthrough technology
for the world of science

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It's called intranasal
light therapy.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:84%
As the name might suggest, this
involves putting a red light

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:84%
into the nasal passage,
which then travels

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:90%
throughout the bloodstream.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The results have
been remarkable.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have Gerald
with us here today.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Gerald.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GERALD COHEN:
Thanks for happening.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so
excited about this.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I love it when there's
technology that, A, works, B,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:84%
is simple, is fundamental on
some level, and even affordable

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's not supposed
to sound like an infomercial.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:10%
It's just that it appears
something really interesting

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:10%
has happened here.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:10%
Before we get into
this particular device,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:10%
I would like to have
a larger conversation

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:10%
about the subject of light and
its impact on the human body,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:10%
mind, emotions, and
even spirit going back

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:10%
into historical times.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll take the
story forward from there.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.328 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: What a
lot of people don't

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:10%
realize is that the energy
portion of our cells,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:10%
the mitochondria, have receptor
sites for photoreceptors

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:10%
for light and that it's exactly
the same ones that plants have.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:10%
So we're designed for light.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.102 align:middle line:10%
And it's been known
since ancient times

00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:10%
that a lot of people
would go into a depression

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:10%
if they didn't have
enough sunlight

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:10%
or if they were living in
darkness and for a prolonged

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:10%
period of time.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And it would affect not only
their emotions, their ability

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:84%
to handle stress, but
also their vibrancy.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:90%
And so we are light beings.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And from a spiritual
standpoint, light

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.048 align:middle line:84%
has to descend in order
for us to become human.

00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you
say descend, are you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:90%
speaking of it cosmologically?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Or how are you speaking of it?

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: From the
spiritual realm--

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --that
light comes down.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:84%
In the last segment, we
talked about, in the Kabbalah,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
that the light has to
descend and become into form.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
If the light comes down
too fast, it shatters.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
If it comes down too slow,
it becomes too concretized.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:90%
And we become too fixed.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So also, in living
in this planet,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
we're light dependent just
like every other living thing.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
deprived of light,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.283 align:middle line:90%
it has profound effects on us.

00:02:52.283 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And of course, ancient
civilizations, ancient healers,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
always understood the
impact of the sun,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:84%
the absolute
necessity of the sun--

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for keeping
a person intact and whole

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
on every level, cellular
through spiritually.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And right now,
our genetic expression

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:90%
is controlled much by light.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:84%
It's being studied at
Stanford and other places.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It's called optogenetics.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
The impact of
controlling genes that's

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
being studied by inducing
certain light inside the cells

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
is being experimented
now with animals.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it's becoming
better known and much more

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.738 align:middle line:90%
available than it was before.

00:03:34.738 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
most people get this.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, certainly you get it.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:90%
You're out.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
You have a little walk in
the sunshine in the morning.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Something feels more
vibrant, and you feel better.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the reality
is that a huge percentage

00:03:45.535 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:84%
of the population
in the modern world

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
spends little to no time
in sunlight anymore.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, we've
been made to fear sunlight

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:90%
through the medical industry.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Correct.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That, to me--

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.208 align:middle line:90%
I have a bug about that.

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, you should
have a bug about that--

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.123 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --that we're
light dependent.

00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
In Israel, in the
Dead Sea, people

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
go to get treatment for all
kinds of skin conditions

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:90%
and health conditions.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
There's different
medical clinics and spas.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
They actually control
individually how much sunlight

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
you should get to
recalibrate those pathways,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:90%
those biochemical pathways.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
chronic diseases

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:90%
improve by their program.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.493 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of really
excellent science behind that.

00:04:27.493 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, the Romans

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
had their share
of knowledge that

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:84%
had been passed down from the
Greeks, from the Egyptians

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.515 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:34.315 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the solariums
were famous in ancient times

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
for healing the
returning soldiers who

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.540 align:middle line:84%
were depleted or
seriously wounded

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:90%
and healing others as well.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you go further back
into more esoteric doctrines

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and memories and
such, healing chambers

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
that were oriented toward
light coming through

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.825 align:middle line:84%
at the times of the
day through apertures

00:04:54.825 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
in these beautiful
rooms and so forth--

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Correct.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --was one of probably
the first lines of attack

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
if there was any
kind of imbalance.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:90%
They went to light, right?

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
sometimes they

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:84%
would throw color in with that,
tint the light through colors

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and thus was born, more or
less, the idea of color therapy.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: There's many effective
therapeutic modalities

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
for many different things
based on these color therapy

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:90%
with lights.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it has been
studied and computerized.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's extremely effective for
a lot of the chronic diseases.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But the intranasal light
therapy is very different.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.225 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to the
story of the Russians.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a progression
of how this came to be.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.837 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
the progression?

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the
Russians discovered

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that a certain red light
frequency, when it was induced

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
into the bloodstream, would have
profound effects on people that

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
were chronically ill or had
autoimmune disease or cancers

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:90%
or other chronic diseases.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And they found a system that
would inject the light directly

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:90%
So it was invasive.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have to go
to a medical office.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
The equipment was
extremely expensive.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And the treatments used
to-- what I remember,

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
it was between $160,
$240 per treatment.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:90%
And you'd have to go every day.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did they do?

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did they
literally intravenously?

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Through a needle, yeah.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they put
light in through--

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: That was the only way
you can get it into the blood.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.348 align:middle line:84%
All light therapy is not
directly into the blood.

00:06:28.348 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It has to go through the
lungs and go through the skin.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.203 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
distributed around the body.

00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
What the Russians discovered--
that if you get it directly

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in the blood, your
oxygen component

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:84%
increases as much as
40%, 45% of the time.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The World Health
Organization said

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that the number one nutrient
deficiency in the world

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:84%
today, over 50% of the
world's population,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
is suffering from
oxygen deprivation.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I think
what we have lost sight of

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:84%
is that that is our
primary nutrient

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
above and beyond
any other nutrient.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.707 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That is life.

00:07:02.707 --> 00:07:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
life, oxygen. And we're

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.450 align:middle line:84%
now on essentially an
oxygen deprived environment.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can look
to a lot of that

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.492 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
environmental factors,

00:07:11.492 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
certainly, the wholesale
clearing of major forests

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that were the lungs
of the planet.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: South America, the
whole save the rain forest

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
thing, people think, I've seen
that bumper sticker forever.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired of hearing it.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: We're suffering from
oxygen deprivation today.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.565 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is at the
bottom of essentially

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:90%
all chronic illness, isn't it?

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's a big
component, yeah.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And so what today
with everything

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.600 align:middle line:84%
going on, with all the poisons,
with all the pollutants,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.665 align:middle line:84%
with all the solvents,
with all the chemicals,

00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every one
of those things

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
deprives our body of oxygen.
And in the planet itself,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:90%
it's being deprived of oxygen.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: We have dead
zones in the oceans.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
We have dead zones
now in our body.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Our body is not designed
to have necrotic tissue.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Our body is
designed for healthy tissues,

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:84%
for controlled death
and rejuvenation.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
populations of people

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that are sicker and
tireder and fatigued

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and not having lives that
are expressing who they are.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I notice this a lot.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of time in
airports flying in and out

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:90%
a couple of times a week.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm noticing that
the queue of wheelchairs

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.231 align:middle line:84%
on each ramp to each
flight is getting

00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:36.439 align:middle line:90%
longer and longer and longer.

00:08:36.439 --> 00:08:36.499 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly, right.

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It used to
be you'd have none.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one or two people
would be in a wheelchair.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
fleet of wheelchairs

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:84%
waiting for people
to get off the plane

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and then ushering
them on as well.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.825 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my thought
initially was, well,

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:90%
maybe more elderly are flying.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:90%
That could be.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But there have
always been people

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.462 align:middle line:90%
of all age groups flying.

00:08:54.462 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the
statistics from there at MIT

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is that there's been an
epidemic of chronic disease

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:90%
and disability.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's increasing
year by year.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
people are not

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:90%
getting the right nutrients.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.205 align:middle line:90%
They're under stress.

00:09:08.205 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:84%
They're not breathing correctly
when you're under stress.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting
enough oxygen.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's causing the
body to break down.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's hard.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when people
hear that, they think,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, maybe I could go get
some more aerobic exercise.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.548 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reality
is, I mean, there

00:09:22.548 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
is a component of that to
start working the lungs.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, if you're
talking about an essentially

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.492 align:middle line:84%
oxygen deprived
environment, you can

00:09:30.492 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:90%
go suck all the air you want.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get
more oxygen, per se.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Or you can
get a little bit--

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A little bit.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.425 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: --from exercise.

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, I
mean, that's not

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
going to take care
of the real issue.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.577 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yeah, it has
to go through the lungs.

00:09:40.577 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
absorbed by the tissues.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
The key thing that
we found, it has

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:90%
to go directly into the blood.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not feasible,
at least in my practice--

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't get a lot of
people that could afford

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
to go to a hospital setting
and spend a part of their day

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
having a needle
put into their body

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and having red light
flow through their blood,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
which will increase the
oxygenation of their tissues.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:90%
They can't afford it.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.668 align:middle line:90%
So what--

00:10:09.668 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
goes to Dr. Lim,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and the Chinese
involvement in this.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, Dr.
Lim was curious.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:90%
How does that red light work?

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:90%
He read the Russian research.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:90%
He saw the profound changes.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:90%
But why the red light?

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I knew from studying of Kabbalah
that the physical universe is

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:90%
made from a red light spectrum.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:10%
So that's the
mystical component.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But from the scientific
component, why the red light?

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So he spent 15 years
reverse engineering

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:90%
why the red light works.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And he found certain
frequencies had

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:90%
profound effects on the body.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The next problem is
the delivery system.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
There are only two
places in the body

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
where you can deliver
directly into the blood

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:90%
without a needle.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: And that's under the
tongue and inside the nose.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:10%
So what Dr. Lim
designed and engineered

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:10%
was a small machine, very
tiny, no bells and whistles.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.260 align:middle line:10%
What he said was the frequency
is the most important thing,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:10%
not the components that
give the frequency, not

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:10%
the actual machine.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:10%
You don't need a large
gigantic machine.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:90%
You just need the frequency.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
The more complex the
machine is, the more likely

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:90%
it's going to break down.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
that makes sense.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So we don't have
any digital displays.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been doing,
I've had at least 50 people

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:90%
on this already.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing people's
neurodegenerative diseases

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:90%
reverse.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing people
have much more vibrancy.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing skin conditions.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing disability
people going back to work.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Because you need this every day.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you do do
it every day, it

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:84%
fills up those photoreceptors
on the mitochondria.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:11.918 align:middle line:84%
And that releases more
energy called ATP.

00:12:11.918 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially,
you're going back

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.055 align:middle line:90%
to this is the prime nutrient.

00:12:15.055 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's the
prime nutrient.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, I want to
ask you something before we

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:84%
go further into the healing
effects and the technology

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
As I'm listening to this, I,
years ago, spend a lot of time

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:90%
studying color therapy.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're saying they're
using the red frequencies,

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
now let's differentiate
this light filler frequency

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:84%
from what would be considered
a light generated color therapy

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.170 align:middle line:90%
using the color of red.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the body,
in different parts

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and different
organs of the body,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.240 align:middle line:84%
each require
different frequencies.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So there you'd be using the
whole spectrum of color.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.877 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
what you're saying.

00:12:51.877 --> 00:12:52.677 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No.

00:12:52.677 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is different.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: This is a
precise frequency.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
There's actually three
that we're working with.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they also cover
a broad array of conditions

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
all red, essentially.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: They're all red.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
If you work with
a blue frequency,

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.933 align:middle line:84%
that's actually very
effective with skin diseases.

00:13:11.933 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, I remember
that from color therapy.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:90%
But these aren't blue.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No, this is red.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: This is a 633.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a 655 and
a 810 frequencies.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're all working
with the 10 Hertz.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So with the 10 Hertz
with those frequencies,

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:84%
they affect the body
in different ways.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Most people need the most
simple kind, which is the LED.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's at
what frequency again?

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: 633.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what does
that assist in the body?

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:90%
How does that--

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, first of all,
one of the problems people have

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:84%
when they're not getting enough
oxygen is that your red blood

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:54.317 align:middle line:84%
cells produced in the spleen
tend to aggregate stick

00:13:54.317 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
together literally--

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Actually--

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: --in clumps.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we have
some video of that.

00:13:57.935 --> 00:13:59.647 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
from Dr. Lim's--

00:13:59.647 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's Dr. Lim's video.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --Dr. Lim's video.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So in a little bit here,
we'll show some of it.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Great.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll queue it up
and show some of the video,

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:90%
so we can see.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And it'll stay on it, as you're
talking, befores and afters

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and show the stickiness and
clumpiness of the cells.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see they
start breaking away and flowing

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:90%
more freely.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So we can take a look
at that in a bit.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: And so when
they break away,

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:10%
the receptor sites
can carry more oxygen.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:10%
And what we've found in testing,
that the oxygen actually

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:10%
goes up 40% to 45%.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That is
really truly shocking.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And now,
that's on average,

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:10%
or that is the high
end of the spectrum?

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: That's on average.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: On average-- 45%.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.377 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: 40%, 45%.

00:14:42.377 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:10%
The question, which is
going to be research,

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:10%
is how long people retain it.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:10%
So when doing the red light
therapy, the only problem,

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:10%
the only negative-- there's
no dangerous side effects--

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:10%
is doing it too much.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:10%
Once you have your
receptor sites filled,

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.168 align:middle line:10%
it's like having what
I use in teaching.

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:10%
It's like you can't put
another car in the garage

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:10%
when all the parking
spaces are full.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.910 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: Once the
receptor sites are full,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:10%
there's no reason to
keep bombarding it.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:10%
So the safe zone is
around 30 minutes.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:10%
So our device shuts off
automatically at 25 minutes,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:10%
so there's no danger.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you say
our, how does that work?

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
You and Dr. Lim began
working together on this?

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: No, Dr. Lim
did the research.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.415 align:middle line:90%
What I'm doing is the clinical.

00:15:28.415 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He did the research.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.097 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the
clinical portion.

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:90%
So you're working as a team now.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.815 align:middle line:84%
And so he's doing the
scientific engineering.

00:15:35.815 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, when I looked
around online on this,

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I saw there were other
kind of nasal lights

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:90%
that were out there.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.125 align:middle line:84%
Are they all
qualitatively the same?

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:45.925 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No.

00:15:45.925 --> 00:15:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so what's
the difference in them?

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.343 align:middle line:84%
Because people will
start looking for these.

00:15:49.343 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: There's different
companies doing it,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.405 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have
the right frequency.

00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have the
right delivery thing.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.040 align:middle line:84%
The very difficult thing
is to get the component

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
in through the nose
that's small enough

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that it's not going to
damage the membranes

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.060 align:middle line:90%
and still deliver the light.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
have one with you.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.863 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There it is.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's see what this is
and how this thing works.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: OK.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:20.748 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to do, instead
of going every day to get a big

00:16:20.748 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:84%
needle put into your arm--
if you're sick enough,

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:90%
you'll do that--

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
is you can buy one for
about the same cost

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.550 align:middle line:90%
it was to do one treatment.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.080 align:middle line:90%
And then you own it.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
do it every day.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you have to
do is change the battery.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But now you're
saying that before when

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.835 align:middle line:84%
these were being utilized, they
were in hospitals or whatnot?

00:16:38.835 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Hospitals
and medical offices,

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
you need a nurse or a doctor,
because it was invasive.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were large units?

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They were
large units, yeah--

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --to get
the same frequency.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So now, you have it down
to the size of a pager.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And then you just--

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, here we go.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Here's the live demo.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:84%
You have it clicked
onto your nostril.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: And here it is.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:59.040 align:middle line:90%
You turn on the Start button.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can see-- if
you turn around toward me

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:84%
a little bit-- yeah, you
can see the red light.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And the red light is
going directly into the blood.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, I can see it.

00:17:07.775 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Our camera's not
close up enough.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
You can see the red
light coming out

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:11.547 align:middle line:90%
of the bottom of the nostril.

00:17:11.547 --> 00:17:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But I can also see
it through the skin.

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If the
room were darkened,

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.832 align:middle line:84%
you'd see that you
look like Rudolph.

00:17:16.832 --> 00:17:17.915 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So you can just stick it--
it clips into your pocket--

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:90%
and go about your business.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.165 align:middle line:84%
And it'll shut
off automatically.

00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:84%
You can get a
little more benefit

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
by doing it twice a day,
but most of the benefit,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
probably 96% of
the benefit, will

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:90%
be from doing it once a day.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So now, as attractive
as it is, thank you

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:90%
for the demonstration.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And then you can turn
it off, or it just shuts off.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It's very simple.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Excellent, thank you
for sharing that.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.232 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I do it at
least once a day.

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I do twice a day.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what have
you noticed personally?

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to talk
about some of the cases

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that you've been involved
with and where it's best use,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
where it's not, the different
frequencies and so forth.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You know, at my age,
I'm going the same as I always

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:90%
have or probably even more so.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.717 align:middle line:90%
So I have 14, 15 hour days.

00:18:08.717 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
When I'm not treating patients--
and I'm treating patients all

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:90%
day--

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm studying and
going to conferences

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.628 align:middle line:90%
and working with scientists--

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:16.753 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Giving workshops.

00:18:16.753 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: --giving workshops.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't afford
not to have energy.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.685 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can't
afford not to be sick.

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is
that the basic one?

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's the laser one.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
the number two one.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: OK.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:90%
And there's the LED one.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The LED, for most
people-- it's more diffuse--

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:90%
is the right one.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:90%
So that one is the cheapest.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And that goes retail for $299.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The laser one is more
for the central nervous system.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:84%
That will affect things
like Parkinson's disease.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:84%
That will affect the
substantia nigra.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a more precise frequency.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So anybody that
has insomnia or any

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:84%
of those central
nervous components,

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:84%
they would benefit maybe
anecdotally from the laser.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The third one is the infrared,
which is an 810 frequency.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:90%
It's also an LED frequency.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not a laser.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's diffuse.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:84%
That one will penetrate the
brain for brain lesions,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:90%
go deep into the brain.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So for almost everybody that's
listening to this, probably

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
the LED would be sufficient.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just the
basic one, and so it's

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.212 align:middle line:90%
going to oxygenate the cells.

00:19:24.212 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Also, the
brain, because--

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the brain, OK.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It recalibrates
the ability of the neurons

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to rejuvenate and help
with the synapses.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
what's happening normally.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
As we kind of go into our
habitual kinds of lifestyles

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
where we're just maybe
not engaged fully in life

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:84%
or we have oxygen
deprivation and such,

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:90%
what is happening to our brains?

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Atrophy and fixation--

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
we talked about it
in the last show.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're
developing every day,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
your brain is going
to lose its capacity

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.182 align:middle line:84%
to rejuvenate and
to cope with stress.

00:20:07.182 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:90%
And you're seeing that today.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.655 align:middle line:84%
We have an epidemic of
neurodegenerative diseases,

00:20:10.655 --> 00:20:11.455 align:middle line:90%
breakdowns--

00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:12.255 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Such as?

00:20:12.255 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Like
Parkinson's disease,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:84%
you have a lot of dementia
diseases, the body

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:90%
just not rejuvenating.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We're not designed to
fall apart as we age.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:84%
We're designed to live
a long, healthy life

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and be vibrant to a
very ripe old age.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's only because of
actions by the human race

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that we suffer from
these diseases of aging,

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.180 align:middle line:90%
so-called diseases of aging.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we
take the easy way

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
out on almost everything
given the opportunity.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.875 align:middle line:84%
We eat foods that
are easy to procure.

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:46.875 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Are they foods?

00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, not really.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We eat substances that
are easy to procure.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We sit ourselves down
in front of television sets,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
where we can be
passively involved.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all
of this is really

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:84%
creating a lack
of the development

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:84%
of new neural synapses
in the brain, right?

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
I see a lot of people

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:90%
that are chronically ill.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And they said, I just
don't feel like myself.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't think.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:84%
My get up and go
is got up and gone.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.830 align:middle line:84%
My relationships, I'm
not making friends.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm irritable.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're suffering from
lack of oxygen and lack

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.785 align:middle line:90%
of nutrients.

00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.617 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And they're starting to
think that that's the new norm.

00:21:32.617 --> 00:21:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
think, oh, once you

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
hit a certain age, once you
hit 40, or 50, or 60, or 70,

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that we should see
this steep decline,

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:90%
this incremental decline.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.210 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And what
really excites me--

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, every day I'm excited--

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:90%
is seeing that that's not true.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Never give up.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Never give up hope
that all we have to do

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:84%
is work harder to find
individual solutions.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Sometimes it's harder.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have
to cast a big net

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
to find out what's
causing these declines,

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:90%
but we'll find out why.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have tools
that are affordable.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:84%
The idea that we can increase
oxygen in people's bodies

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and in their brains at such a
tremendous increase at a price

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.997 align:middle line:90%
that's affordable is--

00:22:18.997 --> 00:22:20.422 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's amazing.

00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: And they can own it.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have to come
to my office or anybody else's

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:90%
office to do it.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we can use the
resources on other things

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
in changing their diet,
changing their attitude,

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
teaching them how to
be calm and focused,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and also have them regain that
passion that they had once.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Because why end your
life feeling that your life is

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:90%
with somebody else's?

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which a
lot of people do--

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's the biggest

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.088 align:middle line:84%
regret is people
didn't go for it

00:22:52.088 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and do what they wanted to do,
because there were compromises

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
made one after the other until
it felt like a shell of a life.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.362 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it does have
to do with a lack of energy.

00:23:00.362 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And a lot of times
with that lack of energy people

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:90%
become addictive.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Half of my
addictive patients

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:84%
are suffering from
nutritional deficiencies.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many people
that were addicts

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that stopped being
addicts once we

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
corrected the hormonal
nutritional deficiencies.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And now, with the oxygen
being able to do the red light

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
therapy, that's just
going to accelerate

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:90%
the process of recovery.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
really exciting.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk about there's
been some neuro testing done

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
some of the tests

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.075 align:middle line:90%
that have been done on it?

00:23:33.075 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: There's
been a lot of tests.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:84%
The literature,
this is mainstream.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:90%
This is not new age technology.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's
mainstream, used in--

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's out there.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's out
there for cancer.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It's out there.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, number one
problem with cancer

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:90%
is hypoxia in the mitochondria.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't getting the oxygen
directly into the mitochondria.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:84%
There are biochemical pathways
called the nitric oxide

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:90%
peroxynitrite pathway.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:10%
That's the same pathway
in the limbic system,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:10%
the emotional part of the brain,
that we activate for learning.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:90%
So it's just hijacking.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The body hijacks that
biological pathway

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.233 align:middle line:84%
that we use for learning to
perpetuate chronic disease.

00:24:18.233 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see
different components

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.062 align:middle line:90%
based on the genetics.

00:24:21.062 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:84%
They'll call it chronic
fatigue syndrome.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:90%
They'll call it fibromyalgia.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.810 align:middle line:84%
They'll call it multiple
chemical sensitivities.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is it's a
breakdown in the body's ability

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:84%
to produce energy
from the mitochondria,

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:90%
that we're starving our bodies.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're not having the right
nutrients to produce energy.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.080 align:middle line:10%
So we break our own body
down to produce the energy.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.548 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, we can't function.

00:24:44.548 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:90%
And we're starving from oxygen.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's scavenging.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.465 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:24:49.465 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Super oxidation is a major
component of those pathways.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that when that happens

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:84%
is that certain receptor sites
called NMDA receptor sites get

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:90%
activated.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And we produce
more nitric oxide.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And so those pathways
start to try to compensate,

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:90%
and we get chronic disease.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And what it'll raise is
a brain neurotransmitter

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:84%
called glutamate, which
basically causes the body

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:90%
to heat up.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:90%
The brain gets hot.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
to the proteins that

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:90%
are necessary for rejuvenation?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They become denatured
and unusable.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And people--

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No longer
involved in repair?

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:10%
They actually will get
into the bloodstream

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:10%
and produce specific
tissue antibodies

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:10%
and start attacking our organs.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you have proteins
that don't belong

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and they get in the bloodstream,
they will literally attack us.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get diseases.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that
in people's thinking.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:90%
You'll see that on MRI scans.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that SPECT
scans and PET scans.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:84%
You'll see actually
the calcification,

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.975 align:middle line:84%
because it actually increases
calcium inside the cell as a--

00:26:06.975 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
implications of that?

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The implication is
that people lose their lives.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:90%
They become something else.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:90%
And they become somebody else.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And they become people
that they don't recognize.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And they blame it on aging,
or they blame it on stress.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.773 align:middle line:84%
Or they blame it on bad luck,
and they usually blame it on--

00:26:24.773 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Genetics, they
blame it on genetics.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Genetics is a big one.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.995 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But it's always
something outside them.

00:26:29.995 --> 00:26:30.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:30.795 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And the healing
has to come from within.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing to do is make

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.040 align:middle line:84%
sure you have enough nutrients
and enough oxygen to heal.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now,
also there was a study

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
that came out by
the World Health

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Organization that spoke
to the levels of oxygen

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:84%
We have just a minute or
so before we take a break.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.030 align:middle line:90%
What was the finding?

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The finding is
that in the atmosphere

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that we have more carbon
in the atmosphere.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.500 align:middle line:84%
We're increasing it
to dangerous levels.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're having
less and less oxygen

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.575 align:middle line:90%
as we cut down the trees.

00:27:01.575 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
saying this is now

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
a health threat to the
entire species essentially?

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yes, not
only our species--

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All living--

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: --all millions species.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.093 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All millions,
and that would

00:27:11.093 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:84%
have to be the plant
kingdom as well?

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the plant
kingdom works on the opposite.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.868 align:middle line:90%
It takes carbon dioxide.

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it
takes the carbon in.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It takes the carbon in.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:90%
So actually, if we disappear--

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's to
the advantage of--

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If we disappear,
the plant kingdom will--

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Would flourish.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --would
flourish, exactly.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: And also, the World
Health Organization this year

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:10%
said that we're entering
the post-antibiotic age.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:90%
They will increasingly not work.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, hold that thought.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
little bit of a break.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.248 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll come
right back, and we'll

00:27:41.248 --> 00:27:43.078 align:middle line:84%
talk about this
post-antibiotic era.

00:27:43.078 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:90%
This is really important.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:10%
We'll be right back.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We are back, and
we're going to talk

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:84%
about the post-antibiotic era,
which now some people would

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:84%
hear that and say, no, you
can't take our antibiotics away.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.290 align:middle line:84%
How many lives have been
saved with antibiotics?

00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.037 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also,
how many lives

00:28:00.037 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:84%
are now being compromised by
the overuse of antibiotics?

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.600 align:middle line:90%
It's both.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
this whole concept.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the
misuse of antibiotics--

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:84%
myself, my life was
saved by antibiotics

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.995 align:middle line:84%
when I had a fungal infection
in my toe of all places.

00:28:11.995 --> 00:28:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, definitely.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And it started
spreading really rapidly.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.008 align:middle line:84%
And I got the
antibiotics in time.

00:28:18.008 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not against antibiotics.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no, I've been
saved by them before, too.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.375 align:middle line:84%
And probably most
people listening

00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:84%
have certainly needed
them from time to time.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have a bias against
pharmaceutical medicines.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:84%
They certainly save
people's lives.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But the problem we're heading
towards, according to the World

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Health Organization--

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
she's a female physician
that is now the head of it--

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.868 align:middle line:84%
is that we're entering
the post-antibiotic age.

00:28:42.868 --> 00:28:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what have our
bodies done with this stuff?

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Why is it?

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.228 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It's not our bodies.

00:28:47.228 --> 00:28:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the bacteria, collectively,
are smarter than we are.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.833 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A-ha,
they're adapting.

00:28:51.833 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They're
adapting so fast.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting--
some scientists like Rupert

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Sheldrake called it
morphic resonance--

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.220 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
learning non-locally.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So as one part of the world,
let's say in the United States,

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.480 align:middle line:84%
learns how to adapt
to these drugs,

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:84%
somehow bacteria in Asia
and other places also adapt.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like the information
becomes non-local.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And it's so expensive
now to develop new antibiotics

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that there's really no
funding and no motivation

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:84%
from the pharmaceutical
industry to try to even keep up,

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's
changing so rapidly.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're heading
towards is that people that

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.520 align:middle line:84%
were routine conditions,
a scrape on the knee,

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:90%
strep throat--

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:40.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sure,
strep throat, yeah.

00:29:40.285 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: There won't
be medications.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And so therapies will be more
expensive and less effective.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And so how do you--

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the WHO,
World Health Organization,

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:90%
is saying this is a reality.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:90%
We are now approaching that.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: We're already in it.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.107 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're in it.

00:29:55.107 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And are you finding when
you hear from clients--

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:90%
you get an array of clients.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they come to
you as a last resort.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Are you finding that
there is this resistance

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to antibiotics now
that's increasing just

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.793 align:middle line:90%
from your own observation?

00:30:07.793 --> 00:30:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, we've known
about it since the 1970s.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Stanford predicted
this, physicians.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But are you seeing it
in the streets more and more?

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, people
now are not responding.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.903 align:middle line:84%
They're coming to
me after they didn't

00:30:17.903 --> 00:30:20.285 align:middle line:84%
get well from the
antibiotics a lot of times.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And I've had physicians
that were students of mine.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:84%
When I've taught
retreats and workshops,

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.013 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of medical
doctors come to them.

00:30:28.013 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were
telling me that they

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.570 align:middle line:84%
were under pressure by their
patients, like their time,

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:90%
4 to 6 minutes or 8 minutes.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have time
to explain that antibiotics

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.780 align:middle line:84%
are not effective, because most
of the infections are viral.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
you want to do

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:84%
is take antibiotics when
you have a viral infection.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But people
don't know anything else.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So they just-- give
me an antibiotic.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get rid of
this chest infection.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.558 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
people feel better.

00:30:52.558 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it was
because of the antibiotics.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.017 align:middle line:84%
But all what
happened was the body

00:30:56.017 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:84%
recruited its reserve energy
in response to the antibiotics.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:10%
And so you get a
burst of energy,

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:10%
and your symptoms go away.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:10%
But the ongoing
chronic infection

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:10%
that produces the
irritation and inflammation

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:10%
for chronic disease still is
inside the cells of the body.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:90%
It's just not on the surface.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so how can
your body without antibiotics

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.562 align:middle line:84%
mimic or create this burst of
energy you just talked about?

00:31:19.562 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It's the same thing.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.312 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
biggest frustrations.

00:31:22.312 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know one of
my frustrations in practice

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.610 align:middle line:84%
is people take
synthetic vitamins

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.470 align:middle line:90%
at high doses, macro doses.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Or they take hormone replacement
therapy, and they feel better.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's a big--

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's hard
for you to argue with that.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're feel better.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.732 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No, I argue with that.

00:31:38.732 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:10%
I tell them exactly
what's going on,

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:10%
that your body's designed,
has a regulatory system,

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:10%
to keep your hormones
at a very low level.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Artificially giving
them out like a nutrient

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.310 align:middle line:90%
is a big mistake.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:84%
The way I explained it
when I was teaching this

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:58.200 align:middle line:84%
is that a hormone
to a nutrient is

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:90%
like a bullet to an atomic bomb.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So the whole body is designed,
your whole hypothalamic

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
pituitary, adrenal, and
if you're female, ovary,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and a man, testes,
axis of communication

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:90%
is designed to regulate.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have this
signal at high degrees.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:22.800 align:middle line:10%
And so the same thing with
a post-antibiotic age.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:84%
When you take antibiotics, when
you take synthetic vitamins,

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.340 align:middle line:90%
it's incomplete.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Biochemically, it's
going to complete itself.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Where is it going
to complete it?

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take your
own body to complete it.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
take your reserve.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a bank
account and going to Las Vegas

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and having the time of your life
and then coming home and having

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.935 align:middle line:90%
the account--

00:32:44.935 --> 00:32:45.735 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Empty.

00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:48.318 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --the account emptied,
and you have to pay the bills.

00:32:48.318 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens is
that you need more hormones.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.350 align:middle line:90%
You need more antibiotics.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.003 align:middle line:84%
You need more vitamins to
maintain that energy level.

00:32:57.003 --> 00:32:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And then after a
while, you crash,

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.430 align:middle line:84%
because your bank
account is depleted.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And your body's
reserves are depleted.

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can't go by
initial response

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:90%
of suppression of symptoms.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Symptoms are actually
the way your body

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.137 align:middle line:90%
copes with an internal stress.

00:33:12.137 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
going on when you're

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:84%
doing that is you're increasing
this chronic inflammatory

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:84%
process and the irritation
and, eventually, the cell

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:84%
membrane, which has all the
information and the components.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the photoreceptors

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.910 align:middle line:84%
plus all the other receptors
are, begins to degrade,

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and you get leakage.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And that leakage, once
it gets into the blood,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:90%
will produce antibodies.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And those antibodies will
start attacking the organs

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.070 align:middle line:84%
by hijacking our own
regulatory system which

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:84%
is designed to keep a kidney
cell from growing in your heart

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.870 align:middle line:84%
or a liver cell
growing in your brain.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:90%
It hijacks the same system.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it
starts attacking the tissues.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you attack the
tissues, you get necrosis.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So the key is to neutralize that
before it gets to the tissue.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the major
problem in chronic disease.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So taking synthetic
vitamins, taking antibiotics

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
when you don't need them,
I'm all for it when--

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.267 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Synthetic
hormones, yup.

00:34:13.267 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I'm all for if it saves
your life and buys your time,

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.460 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not for it as a way of--

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As a way of life.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: --as a lifestyle.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you know, I
want to just throw this in,

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.915 align:middle line:84%
because we talked about
it in the last show.

00:34:22.915 --> 00:34:24.310 align:middle line:10%
And you just
touched on it again.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:27.159 align:middle line:10%
And that's the overconsumption
of synthetic vitamins.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:29.380 align:middle line:10%
And just to kind of
cut to the chase, so we

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:10%
can get on to some case
studies with the light,

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:10%
you were telling me
that there really

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.451 align:middle line:10%
is only one that you know of.

00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:84%
There may be others,
but you're not

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.190 align:middle line:90%
dealing with them personally--

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.190 align:middle line:90%
company that is producing.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's standard
process, right?

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.469 align:middle line:90%
That's a big part--

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:45.639 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
whole food vitamin.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not synthetic and
whole food thrown together.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: No, it's only
made out of foods at levels

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.917 align:middle line:84%
that your body's designed if
you were eating those foods.

00:34:53.917 --> 00:34:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can we buy them?

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Can you go online and buy
them from a standard process?

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to go through a
practitioner of some kind?

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.432 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They have to go
through a health practitioner.

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:03.650 align:middle line:84%
What we found, I had
people buying them,

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.040 align:middle line:90%
because the web sites show up.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Standard process is illegal.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.390 align:middle line:84%
If anybody gets caught
selling them online,

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:90%
they are banned for life.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:90%
And we found a lot of forgeries.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so that's
what I was going to ask.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Knockoffs?

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: A tremendous
amount, I had one patient

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't track.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a lot of help.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And he had a amoeba
histolytica chronically

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.742 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't responding
to my therapy, which

00:35:32.742 --> 00:35:33.700 align:middle line:90%
is a hard one to treat.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a parasite he got in
Chile a number of years ago.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm putting them on herbal
therapies from Australia.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using Standard
Process, and nothing changed.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked him,
are you actually taking?

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And he says, well, yeah.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm buying them
from Amazon from the Standard

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Process website.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, Standard Process doesn't
have a website on Amazon.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:84%
That's good to know,
because people would

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:90%
have gone their first probably.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So I said,
I'll spend the money.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll send it to consumer labs.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't Standard Process.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a
knockoff that was not--

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Basically,
it was nothing.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nothing.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've all been
warned on that one.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Don't go to Amazon.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Nothing wrong with
Amazon, love Amazon.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But don't go there
for Standard Process,

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.327 align:middle line:84%
because it's a fraudulent
site, you're saying.

00:36:19.327 --> 00:36:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Standard Process
is a very difficult--

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:84%
it took me decades to
really learn how to use it.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.562 align:middle line:90%
It's very complex.

00:36:26.562 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
know how to use it.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.008 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to go to
somebody that's trained

00:36:31.008 --> 00:36:32.300 align:middle line:90%
in how to use Standard Process.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not like supplements.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: This is recalibrating
biochemical pathways

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:42.757 align:middle line:84%
using nutrients the way we
evolved over millions of years.

00:36:42.757 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some of the people I
respect the most in the healing

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.105 align:middle line:84%
arts and one practitioner I've
gone to for over 20 years who

00:36:49.105 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:84%
is was very, very proficient
in the world of kinesiology,

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Standard Process is a mainstay.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.543 align:middle line:84%
But he's very specific in
how it's given to people.

00:36:58.543 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's right.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.640 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's just say that.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Because you're
dealing with micro doses.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So we can't just go through a
Standard Process pill at it,

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:06.940 align:middle line:90%
you're saying.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.850 align:middle line:84%
All right, just wanted to
see if that was on the table.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Though there
is one Standard Process

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.390 align:middle line:84%
that I'd say everybody
can benefit [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it a multi?

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, it's
no multi, because they

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.385 align:middle line:90%
don't use synthetic.

00:37:17.385 --> 00:37:18.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:18.185 --> 00:37:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, in terms of
lots of different foods,

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.640 align:middle line:90%
what is the one?

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's a
basic full nutrition,

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:90%
which was the first one.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.480 align:middle line:84%
It was designed for
cancer patients.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's it called?

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Catalyn.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Catalyn,
how do you spell that?

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.967 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That would be safe.

00:37:27.967 --> 00:37:30.993 align:middle line:90%
C-A-T-A-L-Y-N.

00:37:30.993 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Catalyn, so it's
safe for our consumption.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's the foundation.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I want to
get back into--

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.150 align:middle line:84%
because the question
I had asked you is you

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:84%
were talking about you
can throw hormones,

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.630 align:middle line:84%
you can throw
antibiotics at things.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.140 align:middle line:90%
You get a burst of energy.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll start feeling
better, but it's false.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, how can we get that
same inspired energy

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.190 align:middle line:84%
without going to
these harmful means?

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well,
the first thing is

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.807 align:middle line:84%
to eat a diet that's
consistent with your own DNA.

00:37:59.807 --> 00:38:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're talking
blood type stuff, too, here?

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.165 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Blood type
is one component.

00:38:03.165 --> 00:38:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: I don't
only use blood type.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:05.583 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: Blood
type is a database.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:10%
That's all it is.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.180 align:middle line:10%
And it's taking one gene.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.430 align:middle line:10%
It's a very, very
valuable database,

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.883 align:middle line:10%
but there's exceptions.

00:38:13.883 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so it's not a
one size fits all thing.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: No, it's very
much individualized.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I would
say people need

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.433 align:middle line:84%
to listen to our other show,
because you go into this

00:38:24.433 --> 00:38:25.350 align:middle line:90%
at great length there.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:25.393 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:38:25.393 --> 00:38:27.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I do want
to get back to the light.

00:38:27.435 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So heads up, we have
another show coming out.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And we go into this quite
a bit, into the nutrients

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and the other elements of
healing in a natural way.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:35.770 align:middle line:90%
So that will be coming up.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get
back to the light now.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.558 align:middle line:84%
As you were saying earlier, this
therapy is not anything new.

00:38:42.558 --> 00:38:43.975 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has
been miniaturized

00:38:43.975 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and made affordable to
the average person--

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's right.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and household.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is there
have been a lot of studies

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.430 align:middle line:90%
on this therapy for a long time.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
some of the studies, some

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.490 align:middle line:90%
of the conditions.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about what
happens with brain trauma.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
Massachusetts General, Harvard,

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.720 align:middle line:84%
some of the major studies,
mainstream studies

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:90%
on this technology.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, most of the
studies are mainstream.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:10.000 align:middle line:84%
The world's expert
is out of China who's

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:90%
written most of the books.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.367 align:middle line:90%
I have his books.

00:39:12.367 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's his name?

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: I don't remember.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:14.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a Chinese name.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, can't say it?

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: I'm sorry.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK, go ahead.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So that's
going out of China.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.600 align:middle line:84%
He's in contact with Lewis in
the development of the process.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.480 align:middle line:84%
He took his original
idea from the Russians

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.280 align:middle line:90%
and developed it further.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a neurologist out
of Massachusetts General

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and Harvard that's researching
neurological conditions.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
profound changes

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.270 align:middle line:84%
in people that are chronically
neurologically ill.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
brain will respond

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:52.300 align:middle line:84%
when given enough oxygen
and enough nutrients.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through the
blood brain barrier.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.260 align:middle line:90%
There's no negative.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:01.230 align:middle line:84%
If it has the right information,
the brain can also rejuvenate.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, that's big.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Very big.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you talking
about chronic illnesses such

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.550 align:middle line:90%
as Parkinson's?

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Parkinson's, and
now for Parkinson's, probably

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.465 align:middle line:84%
the best would be
the laser in that--

00:40:11.465 --> 00:40:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The laser,
the mid-range one?

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The
mid-range one, yeah.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.777 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
Parkinson's, what else?

00:40:15.777 --> 00:40:18.280 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the other
neurological chronic illnesses

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.690 align:middle line:90%
that we're suffering from?

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, let me
go back to my practice.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.647 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:23.647 --> 00:40:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Typically,
when I'm seeing somebody

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that's really chronically ill
and you have to rebuild them,

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you won't see results
for three months, six months.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.240 align:middle line:10%
And the best results
might take a year or two.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:42.130 align:middle line:10%
For example, in people that
are longtime gluten sensitive.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.600 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It takes a long time.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.368 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: To repair the brain
it's about a year to two years.

00:40:46.368 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about this part.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people know about

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.680 align:middle line:84%
the physiological and
digestive effects of gluten,

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.550 align:middle line:84%
but they don't understand
the long-term consequences

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:57.250 align:middle line:84%
to the brain if you're
truly allergic to

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:90%
or intolerant to gluten.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's like ingesting
toxin for your brain.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:07.910 align:middle line:84%
It will kill-- neuronal
and glial cells,

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:90%
it will make them hypoxic.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And it'll make them necrotic.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
oxygen deprived.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And they'll die.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And when they die,
they literally explode.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.550 align:middle line:84%
When cells have a normal
death, they're recycled.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.200 align:middle line:90%
They become smaller.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And the components are
used to make energy.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And the rest are used to
rebuild other new cells.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trees in
the forest, but what

00:41:29.685 --> 00:41:30.890 align:middle line:90%
happens when they explode?

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Then the proteins
will beget allergies,

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.355 align:middle line:90%
reactions to foreign proteins.

00:41:35.355 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:84%
They're dangerous if they
get into the bloodstream.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.022 align:middle line:84%
They don't belong
in the bloodstream.

00:41:39.022 --> 00:41:41.120 align:middle line:90%
The blood should be pure.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Normally
in a healthy body,

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:84%
the proteins would be
blocked in our immune system

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.670 align:middle line:84%
in the intestines,
which is 60%, 70%, 80%,

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.780 align:middle line:90%
90% of our immune system.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So what will happen is that
you'll produce foreign tissue

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.780 align:middle line:90%
antibodies.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is let's
get the cells enough oxygen.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So what normally would
take me over many years--

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this
for 30, 40 years--

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing quicker
recoveries, because I'm

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.750 align:middle line:84%
getting enough oxygen. I don't
have to worry about the oxygen

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:14.890 align:middle line:90%
into the cells.

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I can deliver it
right into the brain,

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.900 align:middle line:84%
into the nervous
system, or the tissues.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the blood circulates
around the whole body.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And so that accelerates healing.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.850 align:middle line:90%
We can get quicker results.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And then if you feed
the body correctly,

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.112 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these diseases
just happen to go away.

00:42:33.112 --> 00:42:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about heart disease?

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Same thing
with heart disease.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Heart disease--

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is really
clinically impacting heart

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:90%
disease?

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: What muscle--

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:90%
It needs oxygen. Yeah.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: What muscle has
the most mitochondria?

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:45.608 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly

00:42:45.608 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Which muscle cells
have the most mitochondria?

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:90%
The heart.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.922 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is responsible
for oxygenating the body--

00:42:50.922 --> 00:42:53.360 align:middle line:84%
so this is helping
with people who

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:90%
have had chronic heart disease.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But you have to also
feed the heart correctly.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So you have to do
the autoantibody therapy

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.800 align:middle line:90%
to neutralize those antibodies.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And that's specific
nutritional component

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:11.600 align:middle line:90%
to doing that.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to get enough
oxygen to the tissues,

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.880 align:middle line:84%
so they can
rejuvenate and repair.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to get enough
nutrients, particularly

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:24.660 align:middle line:84%
the B vitamins, not the B
vitamins that are synthetic.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:84%
The B vitamins that
are synthetic, where

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.490 align:middle line:90%
do you think they're made from?

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Coal tar.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Coal tar?

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Coal tar.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Ascorbic acid, which is
only 2% of vitamin C,

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:41.030 align:middle line:84%
is made out of table
sugar and sulfuric acid.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
look like each other

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:90%
when you do a spectrograph.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Szent-Gyorgyi,
who got the Nobel Prize

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:53.260 align:middle line:84%
for finding vitamin C, you
know, in the literature

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.672 align:middle line:84%
it said he was so upset when
they called it ascorbic acid.

00:43:56.672 --> 00:43:58.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, that was
just like calling

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.360 align:middle line:90%
the shell of an egg an egg.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It was the
antioxidant component,

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:10.070 align:middle line:84%
which is 2% of vitamin C. If you
have scurvy, what will happen

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.508 align:middle line:84%
is, if you take ascorbic acid,
you'll still have scurvy.

00:44:12.508 --> 00:44:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
need the bioflavinoids.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.160 align:middle line:84%
You need all of the
complex components of it.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: All the
components of it,

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.790 align:middle line:84%
there's many, many components,
including tyrosinase enzymes.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so a lot of
people call heart disease

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.790 align:middle line:90%
the pallagra of the heart.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:31.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a deficiency of
all the vitamin Bs.

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And many of the vitamin
Bs you can't synthesize.

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have to get
vitamin Bs mostly from food

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:39.770 align:middle line:90%
sources, natural food sources.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of that is--

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And that's
what we're designed for.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:42.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:42.665 --> 00:44:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, I know
it can be an issue with vegans

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.790 align:middle line:84%
It can be an issue getting
enough vitamin B6 and vitamin

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:90%
B12 in particular.

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:52.688 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It's a big one.

00:44:52.688 --> 00:44:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a big one.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they're looking, without
eating any animal proteins,

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:90%
how do you get the B12s in you?

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.980 align:middle line:90%
How do you?

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: That's a very
interesting insight.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I have to commend
you on that one,

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.880 align:middle line:84%
because the vitamin B12,
certain forms of vitamin B12,

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.200 align:middle line:90%
lower nitric oxide.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And when we talked about
when people become hypoxic,

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.810 align:middle line:90%
nitric oxide goes up.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And that instigates
a whole pathway

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.950 align:middle line:84%
that leads to these
chronic disease,

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:84%
degeneration diseases that
are exploding as we speak,

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:31.737 align:middle line:90%
literally exploding.

00:45:31.737 --> 00:45:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, I was
a vegetarian for 20 years.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was chronically
B12 deficient.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what is
the answer without going

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.660 align:middle line:90%
into the animal kingdom?

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, a healthy
vegan diet, you can get it.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
get enough of it?

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If you're using
the right chlorophyll,

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.850 align:middle line:84%
the green products,
and stuff like that.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If you're taking what
I use with intranasal therapy--

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is my own development,
so I'll take credit for it--

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --is using fat
soluble chlorophyll,

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.170 align:middle line:90%
which is the blood of a plant.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, fat
soluble chlorophyll.

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.070 align:middle line:90%
What is it called?

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Does it have a name yet?

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Fat soluble--

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Besides fat
soluble chlorophyll?

00:46:07.785 --> 00:46:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah, chlorophyll.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:13.130 align:middle line:10%
We're using it along
with a spleen tissue

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:10%
antibodies, antigens for
the antibodies, along

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.830 align:middle line:10%
with intranasal therapy.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.450 align:middle line:10%
Because the chlorophyll is
the closest to our blood.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.730 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: The only difference is
we have a magnesium molecule,

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:30.825 align:middle line:10%
and 70% of people are
magnesium deficient--

00:46:30.825 --> 00:46:31.625 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:31.625 --> 00:46:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's a big one.

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --instead
of an iron molecule.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're circulating the oxygen
better with the chlorophyll.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
seeing accelerated here.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that
makes perfect sense.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is this
something that's

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.693 align:middle line:90%
readily available for people?

00:46:47.693 --> 00:46:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, can people buy this?

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Or again, do you have
to go to a practitioner?

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You can go through my
website and just say that you--

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You found
someone that's

00:46:56.428 --> 00:46:57.720 align:middle line:90%
making this and providing this?

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.682 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Standard Process
is the one that makes it.

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
Standard Process, OK.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yeah, it's
an expensive one

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.310 align:middle line:84%
that-- they're the
only ones that make it.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:06.490 align:middle line:84%
They're the only ones
who have the technology.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Royal Lee
was an engineer.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.828 align:middle line:90%
He engineered the bombing rocks.

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain who Royal
Lee is and his relationship

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and what Standard Process is
just so people understand.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Royal Lee was an
engineer and a scientist.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:22.520 align:middle line:10%
And he made a lot of money in
his engineering on jet engines.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.670 align:middle line:10%
In World War II, he
designed the bombing racks

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:28.040 align:middle line:10%
for the naval saturated
bombing of Germany

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.900 align:middle line:10%
and ended World War II.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.400 align:middle line:90%
But his love was nutrition.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And he founded Standard
Process and used the science,

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.310 align:middle line:84%
applied it to nutrition
as a way for extending

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:43.800 align:middle line:84%
the life of our species
and extending health

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and made specific
formulas using science

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to replace what
our bodies weren't

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.440 align:middle line:84%
getting as we altered
the environment

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.720 align:middle line:90%
and altered our diets.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is it about
Standard Process and the work

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that he was doing that
still holds up decades later

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:03.070 align:middle line:90%
where others are falling down?

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:03.580 align:middle line:90%
And who else?

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Are there some other
competitors in this market

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.310 align:middle line:90%
that we could access?

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: He never
shared the technology.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So a lot of the
things that they've done,

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.373 align:middle line:90%
they're the only ones doing.

00:48:12.373 --> 00:48:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to
go into the political,

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:84%
but there was a lot
of threats on him.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, sure.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Like Royal Raymond Rife and
many others who were doing--

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They were
friends of his.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And in the
Freedom of Information Act,

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.182 align:middle line:84%
there were a release
of FBI information

00:48:28.182 --> 00:48:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that said everything he said
of what they were doing to him

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.770 align:middle line:90%
was true.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so I mean,
that's a whole different --

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.442 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
most of our viewers

00:48:36.442 --> 00:48:39.340 align:middle line:84%
understand that it's a
very dangerous business

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to offer something that is
genuinely useful and accessible

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:46.000 align:middle line:84%
to the human species
with a no good deed goes

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.380 align:middle line:90%
unpunished in that field.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, they wanted
to buy him out and make it

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:49.860 align:middle line:90%
into drugs.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And make it
prescription only-- that

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:52.770 align:middle line:90%
was their plan.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:53.593 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:53.593 --> 00:48:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: And he resisted it.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.010 align:middle line:90%
He never did it for the money.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.810 align:middle line:84%
He made plenty of money on
his engineering company.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And he also had a
research library,

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:04.150 align:middle line:84%
where he had professional
people to translate

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:08.702 align:middle line:84%
scientific articles from
all over the world which

00:49:08.702 --> 00:49:09.910 align:middle line:90%
nobody was doing at the time.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Most American science was
based on American science.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They weren't reading
Russian and German.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.730 align:middle line:90%
He was reading it.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was a member of the
National Academy of Sciences.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So this was very
advanced science.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And some of the work he's doing,
especially with brain injuries,

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:24.730 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to
ask you about that, brain

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.580 align:middle line:84%
trauma and injuries
with the light

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.900 align:middle line:90%
and the chlorophyll and such.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into it.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: OK.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.490 align:middle line:84%
We have hope for
this, especially

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:38.440 align:middle line:84%
these degenerative diseases
from repetitive traumas.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.460 align:middle line:84%
We're using a particular
nutritional component coming

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.310 align:middle line:90%
from Royal Lee's formulas.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:51.700 align:middle line:84%
We're neutralizing the attacks
on the brain with the antigen

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:59.520 align:middle line:84%
antibody formulas
that literally explode

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.583 align:middle line:84%
the antibodies before
they can get to the brain.

00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.792 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: So the brain can heal.

00:50:04.792 --> 00:50:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
giving it the oxygen,

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.790 align:middle line:90%
so the cells can rejuvenate.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we're teaching
people what kind of lifestyle

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:17.612 align:middle line:84%
changes, which we talked
about in the last interview--

00:50:17.612 --> 00:50:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The interviewer
yet to be aired, yes.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --yet to be aired,
which we talked about it there,

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.290 align:middle line:90%
that actually grow synapses.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Certain activities will
grow 150,000 to 200,000.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So you can replace what you're
losing from degeneration

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.310 align:middle line:90%
as the brain heals.

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we're noticing
that people, especially

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.740 align:middle line:84%
in the wasting
conditions, they're

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:43.390 align:middle line:90%
starting to put back weight.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Their energy starts
to come back.

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:48.350 align:middle line:90%
And their thinking comes back.

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And so you can actually
now heal these type

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.150 align:middle line:84%
of injuries and especially
these closed-in head injuries.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, severe
brain trauma, for example.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Severe
brain trauma, yeah,

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.510 align:middle line:84%
like you're seeing with
the football players.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:01.677 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, repetitive.

00:51:01.677 --> 00:51:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You know, if you
have a series of concussions,

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:08.050 align:middle line:84%
your chances of getting a
neurodegenerative disease

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:09.382 align:middle line:90%
goes way, way up.

00:51:09.382 --> 00:51:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
percentage of people

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.720 align:middle line:84%
would you say from
your practice actually

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:19.540 align:middle line:84%
have undiagnosed brain lesions
and conditions from trauma

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:84%
where maybe you just fell down
the stairs when you were a kid

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.650 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.817 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is this pretty common?

00:51:25.817 --> 00:51:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Especially with kids
that are misdiagnosed with

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:29.450 align:middle line:90%
autism--

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.058 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:51:31.058 --> 00:51:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --a lot of it is
traumatic brain injury.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.180 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that a lot.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying-- we're
in an epidemic of autism,

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.145 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want to
be misunderstood.

00:51:37.145 --> 00:51:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I understand.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But autism
comes from a dysfunction

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:44.330 align:middle line:84%
in the mitochondria, from
the mitochondrial DNA

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:45.550 align:middle line:90%
that breaks down.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And it affects
the mirror neurons

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:50.080 align:middle line:90%
in the pre-orbital frontal lobe.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the ability to empathize
or to connect, what the mirror

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:59.110 align:middle line:84%
neurons do is that
your brain, as we talk,

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.890 align:middle line:90%
is firing the same as mine.

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm doing something,
I'm saying something,

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:04.810 align:middle line:84%
your brain is firing
as if you're firing.

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:06.352 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
entrain to each other.

00:52:06.352 --> 00:52:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But when that is broken
down, that doesn't happen.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.470 align:middle line:90%
So literally, you have no model.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're saying
some of the cases of autism

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.480 align:middle line:84%
are misdiagnosed and are
actually trauma to the brain?

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I ask everybody,
especially kids' parents.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.687 align:middle line:90%
Did he ever have a brain trauma?

00:52:21.687 --> 00:52:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Most of time, they're in denial.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody in the family
will say, oh, no, don't you

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.030 align:middle line:84%
remember when he
fell and smashed

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:32.530 align:middle line:84%
his head against on the
floor when he was one?

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this actually
affects a fairly large part

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:35.680 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.722 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of us have
been knocked on the head

00:52:37.722 --> 00:52:38.522 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: All of us have
been at some time or other.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And that produces
brain tissue autoantibodies.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.980 align:middle line:84%
They are foreign
proteins that don't

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.950 align:middle line:84%
belong in our blood that
are drawn to the tissues

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:52.480 align:middle line:90%
that they come from.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.950 align:middle line:90%
And they alter the tissues.

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:56.595 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.595 --> 00:52:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you're getting
traumatized over and over

00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.690 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at it on
this kind of garden variety

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:06.670 align:middle line:84%
level that many, many
people have been through

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:08.230 align:middle line:84%
in their lives,
what does this do

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:10.990 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the speed of our
processing and our intelligence

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:12.180 align:middle line:90%
levels even?

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It alters the--

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.730 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it can
accelerate the speed.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:17.563 align:middle line:84%
That's where you get a
lot of the people who

00:53:17.563 --> 00:53:21.280 align:middle line:84%
seem to be hyperactive,
where a lot of the damage

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.990 align:middle line:84%
is in the limbic system in the
basal ganglia and the thalamus.

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.300 align:middle line:90%
And so you lose impulse control.

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.395 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:29.395 --> 00:53:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And then that registers
in the hippocampus, which

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:34.520 align:middle line:90%
is very cortisol dependent.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we make the
decisions of what's important

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and what's not important.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, everything
becomes important.

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
hyperstimulated.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.853 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: You're hyperstimulated.

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:46.360 align:middle line:90%
And you can't inhibit.

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It happens actually--

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.983 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it can
happen either way.

00:53:49.983 --> 00:53:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And the globus
internes gives us our ability

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:56.350 align:middle line:84%
to inhibit the inhibition, which
means that we're constantly

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:57.430 align:middle line:90%
excited.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And you see this
over and over again,

00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.890 align:middle line:90%
especially in young people.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And what they
do is self-medicate.

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:02.860 align:middle line:90%
They're smoking cigarettes.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:03.260 align:middle line:90%
They're smoking--

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they're
given Ritalin or something

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:05.500 align:middle line:90%
if they're young enough.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:05.860 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But that's a
different part of the brain.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The Ritalin will
affect the amygdala.

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
talking light.

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:12.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean light.

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a
hyperactive child, what's

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:17.757 align:middle line:84%
called a hyperactive child, one
that might be up for drugging.

00:54:17.757 --> 00:54:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that can
help with this as well?

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If you can
keep it in his nose.

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you can
keep it in it for--

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's the problem.

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:24.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For 25 minutes, keep
it clipped on long enough.

00:54:24.455 --> 00:54:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.557 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if you
could, this actually

00:54:26.557 --> 00:54:27.765 align:middle line:90%
is beneficial, too, for that.

00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.650 align:middle line:84%
It would be
amazingly beneficial.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hugely beneficial,
this is fascinating

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:34.240 align:middle line:90%
just the effect on the brain.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.385 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: And the nutrition.

00:54:35.385 --> 00:54:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
and the nutrition,

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.380 align:middle line:84%
which we can't get
into in detail.

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.342 align:middle line:84%
But again, our other
conversation coming up,

00:54:40.342 --> 00:54:41.300 align:middle line:90%
you want to watch that.

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: No, but
specific nutrition

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.710 align:middle line:90%
for that part of the brain.

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, which is?

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well--

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We can't go into that.

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.610 align:middle line:84%
We need hours and hours
to talk about all this.

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Let me just say
that that does exist.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does exist, OK.

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.375 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: We can target
different areas of the brain

00:54:53.375 --> 00:54:54.760 align:middle line:90%
with specific nutrients.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about--

00:54:56.070 --> 00:55:00.370 align:middle line:84%
you touched on it earlier in the
hypoxia situation with cancer.

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:03.720 align:middle line:84%
What kind of cancers are
responding also to light?

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I say cancers, we're
talking about rebuilding

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:07.690 align:middle line:90%
the immune system at large.

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:08.800 align:middle line:90%
But what have you noticed?

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I've noticed
that people are still alive when

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.960 align:middle line:90%
they gave them three months.

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I mean, with the
light therapy and his papers--

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Lew just sent me a paper on
cancer saying the same thing

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:21.430 align:middle line:90%
that I've noticed.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:22.930 align:middle line:90%
I have cancer patients.

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not treating
their cancer, but I'm

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.980 align:middle line:90%
treating them with nutrition.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To boost their immune
system and their well-being?

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, also to
change the physiology.

00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I mean, we're
using a lot of things.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of patients
that have breast cancers that

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:44.690 align:middle line:84%
are being treated at Stanford
with different chemotoxic

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:45.490 align:middle line:90%
agents.

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And their immune
system is staying

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.572 align:middle line:84%
alive every time they're taking
the nutrition I give them.

00:55:51.572 --> 00:55:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And the nurses and
doctors are noticing--

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you using the
light with this as well?

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So you're using
light and nutrition.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And so it's staving off the--

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oxygen is a nutrient.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --side effects
of chemo, you know.

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:01.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's not the
side effects of chemo.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:07.090 align:middle line:84%
What happens with chemo is that
it destroys the immune system,

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:08.815 align:middle line:84%
so you get opportunistic
infections.

00:56:08.815 --> 00:56:09.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:09.653 --> 00:56:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And also the
problem with chemo

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.580 align:middle line:84%
is that it's going to
create other cancers,

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.200 align:middle line:90%
because the cells will alter.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.250 align:middle line:90%
This is not my opinion.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:19.490 align:middle line:90%
This is in the literature.

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right.

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:21.208 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Oncologists
talk about it.

00:56:21.208 --> 00:56:24.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why they talk about
a five year survival rate.

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the key things
of why it will alter

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:29.560 align:middle line:84%
is that, with the
cancer, the cancer cells

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.870 align:middle line:90%
need eight times the sugar.

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And they need way more
oxygen than healthy cells.

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can't go into that,
because we're just about

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:39.190 align:middle line:90%
out of time.

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh my gosh.

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
only have about a--

00:56:41.108 --> 00:56:41.980 align:middle line:90%
I know, it flew.

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm glued to it.

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.710 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
minute or so left.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Just any final thoughts?

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Anything you'd like to say
that we haven't swept up yet

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:51.978 align:middle line:90%
regarding this light therapy?

00:56:51.978 --> 00:56:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Regarding
the light therapy?

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: To me, it's
the one major technology

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.085 align:middle line:90%
that I endorse.

00:57:00.085 --> 00:57:01.960 align:middle line:84%
There are many technologies
that help people.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You've used a lot.

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I know you've used
a lot of them.

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:04.973 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And a lot
of them I explored.

00:57:04.973 --> 00:57:07.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a proponent of them.

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But what I found is that they
will work for one person.

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:14.230 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough science
to know long-term results.

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, one of the dangers,
if you're inexperienced,

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:21.140 align:middle line:84%
is making judgments
on short-term effects.

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:23.300 align:middle line:90%
And we did discuss that.

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.373 align:middle line:84%
So this is relatively
safe across the board

00:57:25.373 --> 00:57:26.290 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying?

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: This is totally safe.

00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:28.618 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:28.618 --> 00:57:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The only
thing it's not safe

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.400 align:middle line:90%
if you think more is better.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So if we do decide
to buy into this,

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:38.030 align:middle line:84%
make sure that we do not keep
that up our nose all day.

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:39.380 align:middle line:90%
25 minutes once a day is fine.

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Or twice a day.

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or twice a day.

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Gerald, thank you so much.

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It was a pleasure.

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We should
have another hour.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, this has been
music to my ears.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's given you some
food for thought as well.

00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:51.400 align:middle line:10%
