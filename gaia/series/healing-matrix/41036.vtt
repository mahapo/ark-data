00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
After being exposed

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to massive amounts of
radiation near Chernobyl,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Katrine Volynsky
discovered that she

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:84%
had radiation in
her bone marrow.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
By 17 years of age, she bled out
internally and officially died.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:84%
This event prompted
her to become

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
dogged researchers

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
into the field of health
that I have ever encountered.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
She's a virtual fountain
of useful information

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:84%
on how to both detox the
body and also revitalize it.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:84%
What intrigues me most about
the research for her book,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
"Staying Alive in a
Toxic World" is the focus

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:84%
on the frequency of
the things we ingest.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
If we can raise the
frequency of our foods,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
we raise the condition
of our health.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I loved our last
interview on radiation

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and helping to basically
chelate it out of the body.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
But this is a much
broader conversation

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:90%
about health in general.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you're the picture
of vibrant health after going

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
through some really horrendous
things in your youth

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:84%
as a result of growing
up near Chernobyl

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:90%
at a very vulnerable age.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back, first of all.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And then give a tiny
little description

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
of what happened to your family
at Chernobyl, just as a recap.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I know we talked about
it in our last show.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KATRINE VOLYNSKY: And thanks
so much for having me back.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So,
yes, my family got

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
exposed to radiation
in Chernobyl.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:84%
We were right in the
area when that happened.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.367 align:middle line:84%
And for the next
seven years, we were

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
living in the area
in Belarus that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
were getting 40% of the
fallout for the seven years

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:90%
that we were living there.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And most of my family got
affected by radiation.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
cancers in my family.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has some sort of issue.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Luckily, everyone is alive.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm very fortunate.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:90%
I, myself, did not get cancer.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I was afflicted with a little
bit of a different issue, which

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is extreme anemia and a lot
of hormonal disturbances.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And growing up, I was
seeing a lot of people

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
around me, as well, getting
affected by radiation.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I was 17, I had
gotten into a health situation

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
where I had lost a lot
of blood and died--

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
clinically dead--
I had come back.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't my time.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was prompted by the
love for my grandmother

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and just wanted to
be there for her.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And since then
it's been research

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
into how to get myself back
into health and vitality.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to just
be moderately healthy.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Once I knew what health
really feels like,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I want to be extremely
vital and radiant.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.417 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you are.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Oh, thank you.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I actually had people
joking, you know,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.656 align:middle line:84%
if this is what radiation looks
like, I want to have some.

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
turned it around.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.576 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: It took a while.

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, It took a
while to get there.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's a big point.

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
People have to understand
once you've fallen out

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
of a vital condition,
it does take time.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:90%
There's no magic bullet.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes down to it,
you have to educate yourself.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to use
some discipline, you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
have to be wise in what
you choose to buy into

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:90%
to restore your health.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I love your book.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.768 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, there's
definitely no magic bullet.

00:03:36.768 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:84%
There's like no one pill, and
there's definitely no secret.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.185 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:40.768 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: You know?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.490 align:middle line:84%
It just takes time and just your
commitment to being healthy,

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:84%
to your lifestyle, and
to certain practices

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.487 align:middle line:84%
that you do daily that
are health building.

00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And vitality
building, and that

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
can also spread very
easily around you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's so easy to teach
others to do it as well.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I found that a lot of people
in my family and my friends

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
have been able to take it up
quite easily once they saw

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
how much change it made in
me because it was so radical

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:90%
when I did get healthy.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So it is inspiring,
not just for yourself,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.415 align:middle line:90%
but those others around you.

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.166 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
a quick question.

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is just an aside, but
because your endocrine system

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
was impacted and that of
probably hundreds of thousands,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
if not millions of
other people, were there

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.515 align:middle line:90%
fertility issues following that?

00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Oh, definitely.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:32.161 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the birth rates
after the exposure in Chernobyl

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
over the years?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well, there has
been a decline in birth rate.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And some of it was
people actually fearing

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
of even having children
and having birth defects.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So there was some
psychological factors in that.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Definitely a lot of children
born with birth defects.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, all sorts of-- you
can see a lot of documentation

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And also couples not being
able to have children,

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
but that had taken
a while is actually

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
couples my age that were
exposed to this low level

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:90%
radiation for a long time.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.250 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just--

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now it's
expressing itself.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.845 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It wasn't that
massive radiation exposure

00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:90%
in one time in Chernobyl.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It was like over time, all these
radioactive particles and heavy

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
metals, and everything
that we were exposed to,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
it just built up to a
place where a lot of people

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:90%
my age can't have children.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
in Russia, you can

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.807 align:middle line:84%
see that same thing
happening here.

00:05:22.807 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And it's like
a lot of people not able

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:90%
to have kids.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
we forget, infertility

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.141 align:middle line:84%
is representative of many other
things going on in the body.

00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KATRINE VOLYNSKY:
Absolutely, yes.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just infertility,
but massive changes

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.137 align:middle line:84%
in a female
endocrine system too.

00:05:39.137 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
women that are having

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:90%
issues in that department.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I don't
know too many that don't.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And it is partly from
radioactive exposure,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
we've been exposed to over time
and all the other chemicals

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:90%
that we're exposed to as well.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one thing.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It's the cumulative effect.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.354 align:middle line:84%
We've just literally
been experimenting

00:05:58.354 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
on ourselves for
the last 100 years

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
while we've been
evolving industrially.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like, but how David Suzuki
says that our environment is

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
changing so rapidly that our
body has no time to catch up.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
having so many issues

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:90%
in our society with health.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
we're being introduced

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.257 align:middle line:90%
to so many man-made toxins.

00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And we are also forgetting
what is nature giving us.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:84%
We have been living in
very unnatural conditions.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
We sit in front of a
computer, we're looking at TV,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
we don't have connection to
earth, we don't work barefeet,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
our children don't know where
the food is coming from.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Like I had a client
that was my age

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.915 align:middle line:84%
and I was saying how my
cat brought a mouse over

00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and she looked at me and
she had this puzzled look,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.994 align:middle line:84%
she goes, oh, that's why Tom
was always running after Jerry.

00:06:45.994 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:90%
She had no idea.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the cartoons?

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KATRINE VOLYNSKY:
Yeah, she had no idea.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She didn't
know chase mice.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: How crazy is that?

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's how disconnected.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just living in this
completely mental digital space

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.455 align:middle line:84%
that has disconnected us with
our own innate intelligence

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and innate intelligence
of the nature.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.172 align:middle line:84%
Like it's simple things, all
the things that I teach people.

00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:90%
They are simple things.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And they take a little
bit of rewiring back

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.829 align:middle line:90%
to what is natural anyway.

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.293 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the book,
"Staying Alive in a Toxic World"

00:07:15.293 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is very practical,
very approachable.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in there that
one can't do if you choose to.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you have to go
out to an expensive clinic

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:90%
to reboot.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely not.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
start one day at a time,

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
changing one little
thing at a time.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
One other thing you talked
about is the explosion

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
of certain chronic conditions
such as obesity and, moreso

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
even, inflammatory
diseases which

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
seems to be at
the base of almost

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:90%
every single chronic disease.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And medicine isolates one
thing, one factor, one nutrient,

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and focuses on one
inflammatory disease,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.260 align:middle line:90%
but in fact, it's all connected.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It's
absolutely all connected.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And we have also diabetes,
that's a huge one.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
undiagnosed diabetes.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the doctors I
really admire, Mark Hyman

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:90%
talks about it--

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mark Hyman yes.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: --yeah
that how there's so

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
many people in
pre-diabetic conditions

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.837 align:middle line:84%
and they have no idea
because they're seemingly OK.

00:08:06.837 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Huge percentage
of the population.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.628 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely.

00:08:09.628 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's all a combination,
again, of all those factors

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:90%
is food devoid of nutrients.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And not having enough
hydration, not moving enough,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:84%
having a lot of toxic
substances in our diet.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is consciously
or unconsciously.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Some recreation drugs,
sometimes chemtrails,

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:90%
you can't control that.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
If you think they're not
there, they're there.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
I do hair analysis and every
day I see the aluminum levels,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:90%
there's no way.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of living here.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've done a couple
shows and it's definitely

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:84%
worth people looking into,
if you haven't already.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Watch the shows we did on
chemtrails because this

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.224 align:middle line:90%
a new fact of life.

00:08:52.224 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really matter
where in the world you are.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It used to be only
certain countries,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
but now there is seldom you
can go to a country, maybe

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.195 align:middle line:84%
a small island with
certain breezes, where

00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:90%
you don't find chemtrails.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Which we're talking aluminum,
barium, and strontium which

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.160 align:middle line:84%
is raining down upon us
in the form of clouds,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.937 align:middle line:84%
hydration rain, and
such all the time.

00:09:11.937 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:90%
And I don't get into deals why.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:84%
The point is it's
here and we have

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to deal with it.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Same with pesticides,
same with fertilizers.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.051 align:middle line:84%
We've been using them.
they're still in the soil,

00:09:24.051 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
commercial products

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:90%
that people are still using.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Organics have come a long way.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:84%
You can see just how many Whole
Foods are around nowadays,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
You see how much have
grown the whole movement

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.042 align:middle line:84%
and purchasing your products
at a farmer's market, that's

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:40.375 align:middle line:90%
a really good way to control it.

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:42.779 align:middle line:84%
But still, you still
get a lot of residues

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:90%
even through your waters.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.111 align:middle line:84%
Through your water that you're
bathing in because there

00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:51.555 align:middle line:84%
is residues of those fertilizers
and parts of medical drugs

00:09:51.555 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:84%
that are in the
water that you're

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:90%
absorbing through your skin.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.857 align:middle line:84%
So you can't control
all of those toxins.

00:09:56.857 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: You can't.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:90%
You can do the best you can.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:84%
You can eat organically, if
you can, if you can afford it.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:84%
you can get a good
filter on your tap,

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:84%
you can put an air
filter, but you still

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:84%
can't control what you're going
to get exposed to out there.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I talk about
it, there is no need

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:90%
to get angry about it.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is unfair
that it's happening,

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:90%
but it's part of evolution.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.584 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yes, it's
not good that we've

00:10:20.584 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
been kind of experimenting
on ourselves,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
but we also have come a
long way in our technology

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.169 align:middle line:90%
and our ability.

00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To clean it up.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah,
to clean it up, too.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.819 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one thing about
you that I find so interesting

00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is we were talking off
camera about you had bought

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
some organic produce
from the farmer's market

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and then when you washed
it that way you do,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
it had this kind of oily,
yellowish, little fat globules

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.190 align:middle line:90%
floating to the surface.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.995 align:middle line:84%
So most people would say, oh,
there's something on there.

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So you don't-- you skim
it, you take it to the lab,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:84%
you take everything
to the laboratory,

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.913 align:middle line:84%
and find out what's on
there, and then go and talk

00:10:53.913 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:90%
to the farmer.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.655 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
said this is organic.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So you take everything
to the extreme

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
to find out the truth
of what's going.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.091 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah,
I'm a truth seeker.

00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what's happening
so I can help people better

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:84%
understand the
situation and how they

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.104 align:middle line:84%
can help their bodies
to deal with anything.

00:11:09.104 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about the choice

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:90%
that we all have to make.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is one that most of
us essentially default in.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't really choose.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Most people instead of
choosing vibrant health

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.420 align:middle line:90%
are choosing to stay alive.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.235 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about
this in your book.

00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:25.901 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes.

00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have a huge population
that are living in this haze,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A haze?

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.341 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, it is a haze.

00:11:33.341 --> 00:11:34.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a brain fog.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And we think, like,
I did not know

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
what healthy was
until I got healthy.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my twenties, and
I had all these hormonal issues

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.409 align:middle line:84%
and all those things, I
thought that was normal.

00:11:44.409 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Because, like, I thought that
not going to the bathroom

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.702 align:middle line:90%
was normal.

00:11:47.702 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Like silly stuff like
that because everyone else

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:90%
thinks that that is normal.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But once you get really
vibrant, really healthy,

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:90%
you know the difference.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And you see those people.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:90%
They are sparking up.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Like the room is
electrical around them.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:84%
There's this spark in their
eyes and there's vibration,

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
you can feel it and they have
all this energy and ability

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to be in a state
of hyperactivity

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and just be very
aware and conscious.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Part of it comes from choosing
to be in that vibrant state.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is not most of
the population we see.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
We dumb ourselves down with
a lot of different things.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:21.890 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:23.875 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, your writing partner
in this, Wade Lightheart,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
how did you come
together and what

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
was his specialty in
terms of expertise

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:84%
he brought to the table,
and how did you create this?

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well, Wade has
been my partner in crime

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.969 align:middle line:84%
how I call it, he's
been my researcher body.

00:12:39.969 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I actually met him
for the first time

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:84%
when I was looking for
solutions for my health

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and I knew I needed
some physical activity.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying all
the different trainers

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.584 align:middle line:90%
around my city.

00:12:49.584 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up meeting him
and he was very different

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:84%
because he had that
vibrancy around him.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's a very
positive, amazing person.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So while I was going
through my health crisis

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and trying to figure
out how to heal myself,

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
he was going through
his own health crisis.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.535 align:middle line:90%
He was a vegan bodybuilder--

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's difficult.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: That's
very difficult.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That presents
some challenges.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah and
he's also a champion.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:90%
He's a national champion.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while to
get to that level.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:84%
He's also very
interested in health

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:84%
because his own sister
had died from cancer

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:90%
when she was very young.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And so he saw what
going the medical route

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.345 align:middle line:90%
can do to a person.

00:13:25.345 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
He really didn't
want to be there

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.161 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted others not to have
that situation basically forced

00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.284 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:13:32.284 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So while I
was trying to get better,

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
he was also trying to heal
his body from crazy amounts

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
of dieting and getting ready
for body-building shows.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And basically going on
massive acidic state

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and completely
crashing his system.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So we've been friends for
almost 10 years and a lot

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.924 align:middle line:84%
of the research we
have done together.

00:13:51.924 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of experimentation on
ourselves we've done together,

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:84%
so it was kind of natural
for us to come together

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
to write this book and also
to teach because we both bring

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.755 align:middle line:90%
different parts to the equation.

00:14:02.755 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
the one thing you just

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.496 align:middle line:84%
talked about there
is a lot of movement.

00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
He was into his body, he
was into body-building,

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.554 align:middle line:84%
you're really big
into movement as well.

00:14:09.554 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be a
big point of resistance

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.304 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:13.886 align:middle line:84%
Because we're kind
of running so fast,

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:84%
we're running right
past our own lives

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and forgetting
that we have a body

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
because our world has become
extraordinarily mental.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to take
place on the mental plane.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.334 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some
of the simple things

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about
in the book, I love,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
which is combining breath
work with simply walking,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:84%
but also what happens
biochemically when we move.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.816 align:middle line:84%
Why we have to move to
have vibrant health.

00:14:38.816 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.205 align:middle line:84%
So one of the most important
things you can do for health

00:14:42.205 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:90%
is simply breathe.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And not breathe shallow
like we usually do.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Because most of us don't
get enough breath out

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.315 align:middle line:90%
of our diaphragm.

00:14:50.315 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
barely breathing.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.743 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:14:51.743 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But our number one
nutrient is oxygen, right?

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
You can go without
food for a long time,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:84%
you can go without
water for a long time.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.534 align:middle line:84%
How long can you
go without breath?

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.866 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Not so
long, but a lot of us

00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:84%
don't understand how important
it is to breathe deeply

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
detoxify your system.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
To move the toxins out and
to bring the nutrients in.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine those
deep breathing practices

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:84%
with exercise, you know,
like simply walking and doing

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
what I call the
10/10/10 breathing.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:90%
So for 10, you're inhaling for--

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 10 counts.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: 10 counts.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're inhaling
while you're walking.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.248 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes,
10 you're holding,

00:15:28.248 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:90%
and 10 you're breathing out.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So that whole thing is
energizing your body.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You're getting oxygen,
you're getting movement.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
The cells get this
pumping action

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
of being able to
move the toxins out.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
interesting thing.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:84%
In our society, we
focus a lot what

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:90%
we're putting into our body.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Like even the
nutritional industry

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is all about this super
food, and that super food

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:90%
and this and that.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And not focusing enough
of moving things out.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of becoming a little
bit more prominent to cleanse.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a big fan
of it, but there's

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:90%
lots of cleanses in the boxes.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.929 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of people it
just becomes a real quick fix

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
of, I'm just going to do
whatever I want and then I'm--

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for
some people it's

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.976 align:middle line:84%
actually harsh and
even dangerous.

00:16:10.976 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly and
then they just go and water

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.071 align:middle line:84%
and these herbs and just
basically, you know--

00:16:15.071 --> 00:16:17.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Strip their system
of everything, good and bad.

00:16:17.445 --> 00:16:18.403 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely.

00:16:18.403 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the way to do it.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Simply doing for a couple
minutes that's walking

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and breathing will move more
toxins out of your system,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.301 align:middle line:84%
than you would be able to get
with those supplements and --

00:16:33.301 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes yes, yes.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.389 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And not
drinking and actually you're

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:84%
doing damage to your
metabolic system.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:90%
So air is the most important.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.880 align:middle line:84%
We have this awesome formula,
how we call it, air water.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Next thing is exercise and
I kind of skipped water,

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:84%
but water is also
very important.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's,
before we leave exercise,

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.365 align:middle line:84%
you're really big and so
are others on rebounding.

00:16:55.365 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Oh, absolutely.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Rebounding.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Things have to be easy for
us to be able to do it.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So we weren't even
talking about it,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.496 align:middle line:84%
what do you do
when you're so busy

00:17:04.496 --> 00:17:06.329 align:middle line:84%
and you have so many
things, and you wake up

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.919 align:middle line:84%
and you have your brain
already focused on your day

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:11.079 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
enough time to move?

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So rebounding is one of
the most amazing quick ways

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to get your whole
system charged up,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
moving, and moving
the lymphatic system.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Lymphatic system is bigger
than your blood system,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like
your sewage basically.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And we just simply
don't move it.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now we have this
clogged up lymphatic system.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
it's been discovered by NASA

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that rebounding-- they were
using it for their astronauts

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
when they were coming
back from space,

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:84%
they were actually
using rebounding action

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:84%
to get their motion
back into their body

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:90%
to recondition their system.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Rebounding has two forces.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And rebounding is
jumping on a trampoline,

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:52.701 align:middle line:90%
for those who don't understand.

00:17:52.701 --> 00:17:54.695 align:middle line:90%
That's a mini trampoline.

00:17:54.695 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So jumping on a trampoline and
you have two forces working.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
You have acceleration and
you also have gravity.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally like
a pump in every cell.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.915 align:middle line:84%
So you're not just
exercising one muscle,

00:18:06.915 --> 00:18:09.750 align:middle line:84%
you're exercising
every cell in your body

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
by moving the liquids out
and moving the toxins out

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and bringing the oxygen and
nutrients and the good water

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So in 15 minutes, you can do
more than most other people can

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:84%
do in half an hour
walking on the rebounder.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got those
two opposing forces

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.485 align:middle line:84%
basically moving every
cell in your body.

00:18:28.485 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty easy to do.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.534 align:middle line:84%
It's at your home, it can
only take 10 to 15 minutes,

00:18:33.534 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that's the maximum
you want to do.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.408 align:middle line:84%
You can go as hard
as you want, you

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.270 align:middle line:84%
can really go crazy
and do running,

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of different--

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or you
can just bounce.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: --tricks.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Bounce, yeah.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mentioned
water and I backed you

00:18:42.713 --> 00:18:43.740 align:middle line:90%
up into rebounding.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the quality of water.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
For anyone that might still
be drinking out of the tap.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, tap.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
For anyone who is
drinking out of the tap,

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend
that you don't do that.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Our water supply is
really contaminated.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of the supply, and
unless you have artesian well,

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
you've got fluoride,
you've got bromine,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:84%
you have all sorts of
what's called halogens which

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.247 align:middle line:84%
is blocking your body's
ability to absorb iodine,

00:19:10.247 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:90%
which we've talked about before.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's very detrimental
on your health

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.547 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
a lot of it when

00:19:17.547 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:90%
you're drinking it in the water.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they have to
put it in the water,

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:90%
that's the regulations.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And also water is a very
interesting subject.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.749 align:middle line:84%
We could do like probably
hours and hours on it.

00:19:28.749 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
There's all this
new research talking

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:84%
about the structure
of the water, too.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It picks up
in the energy, right?

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's kind of
where Patrick Flanagan's work

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.222 align:middle line:84%
comes in with Mega H
and I know that's been--

00:19:37.222 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a lot of science
has been done on Mega H.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So we got the
one point is chemically,

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:84%
how chemically
clean the water is.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't want all those
contaminants in there.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So you want it to be clean, free
of contaminants, number one.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Then you have second,
what is your water,

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:90%
how is it structured?

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.927 align:middle line:84%
You know like how
absorbable it is.

00:19:56.927 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the water
that's coming through the tap

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:84%
or it's been sitting
in water bottles,

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
your body can't absorb really
well because your body has

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:84%
this little protein
that's called aquaporins.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:90%
That are kind of like gates.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:90%
They let the water in and out.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:90%
And they're small.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.147 align:middle line:84%
So when you have water
that's come in your body,

00:20:14.147 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:84%
that's been sitting for a
long time in the bottle,

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:84%
or travelled through right
angles in our plumbing system,

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.720 align:middle line:84%
it's bunched up in
these big clusters.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Because of hydrogen bonding.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.566 align:middle line:90%
Because water is never just H2O.

00:20:28.566 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's water and a whole
bunch of other things.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It's a
liquid with stuff in it.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has a clustering
structure that's changing.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, it's changing.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.281 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when it's
stagnant like that,

00:20:37.281 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting because I don't
drink bottled water very often.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But when I do, my stomach
doesn't feel right

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.915 align:middle line:90%
and I don't feel right.

00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel good.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.781 align:middle line:84%
It gives me an acidic
kind of stomach for one.

00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well,
one of the reasons

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
is because it's not as
bioavailable because it's

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
in those big clusters that your
body can't absorb very well.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why if you drink a whole
bunch of water on a hot day,

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel it sloshing
in your stomach.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Water that has been
microclustered,

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
Patrick Flanagan talks

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
about, he was the first one to
deal with the microclustering

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:90%
research--

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.318 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:21:08.318 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: --is the water
that's separated into small

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.436 align:middle line:84%
clusters, small enough for your
aquaporins, those proteins,

00:21:14.436 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:90%
to be able to bring it in--

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And making
hydrogen available to you.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah to
bring it into the cell

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.317 align:middle line:90%
and move the toxins out.

00:21:21.317 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So for a long
time, there was this thought

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that water just kind of
goes in and out of the cell,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and his product,
that's been available,

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:84%
gosh, he created that what,
15, 20 years ago, anyway.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's is
called Mega H, Megahydrin,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:90%
you can go online.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well,
he's got two products.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:84%
One's called Crystal
Energy, that's the one--

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In a liquid form.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.395 align:middle line:84%
That makes the surface
of water tensions

00:21:42.395 --> 00:21:45.080 align:middle line:90%
lower and small clusters.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And he also has another
one called Mega Hydrate.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is a product that makes
hydrogen available in water

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
in a form that's
called active hydrogen.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It's hydrogen with
an extra electron.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.419 align:middle line:84%
And it's a primordial
antioxidant.

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:90%
It's in everything.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.668 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
his inspiration was

00:22:03.668 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:84%
off the Hunza water and some of
the other waters of Vilcabamba.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
What was it that was making
these waters so incredibly

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
charged and active
that it was creating

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
almost a reversal of aging
effect in the populations.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Or a lack of degeneration.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.164 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, if anyone
wants to look,

00:22:19.164 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:90%
you can look that up online.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.622 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of science on it.

00:22:21.622 --> 00:22:23.038 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And
it was a huge part

00:22:23.038 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:90%
of my own protocol for recovery.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I was actually using his
Mega Hydrate to get better.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Because part of the recovery
to get your DNA back,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, basically,
and help yourself

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:84%
of this free radical
damage is to get those

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
electrons for your body
to be able to repair.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And Mega Hydrate provided it
for me in massive quantities.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Like my body wasn't able
to get this much electrons

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:90%
from food from antioxidants.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But because Mega Hydrate
is readily available.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Another way of
doing this, there's

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:84%
actually a lot of
ionizers on the market.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And they create
charged, ionized water.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Also has a whole bunch
of electrons in it

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that your body can
use very easily.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: For
the same process.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people can
look up these ionizers.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kangen and Alkalife,
there are a lot of them.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: There's a
lot of different ones.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.619 align:middle line:90%
It's just like choose one.

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:90%
And so water.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of-- you
drink a ton of water.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:90%
You drink--

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: I do.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You drink quarts
and quarts in the morning.

00:23:23.715 --> 00:23:23.925 align:middle line:90%
the morning.

00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.656 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons why I'm
able to drink so much water

00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
is because my water
is micro-clustered.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.126 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: I can actually
drink a quart of water and jump

00:23:31.126 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:84%
on my rebounder
and don't feel it.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The water quantity is-- a
lot of people are dehydrated.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Most of the times when
we experience hunger it's

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.850 align:middle line:90%
actually dehydration.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So we recommend for people
to drink half an ounce

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.614 align:middle line:90%
for every pound of body fat.

00:23:48.614 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So depending
on your weight, obviously,

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.464 align:middle line:90%
the water will vary.

00:23:53.464 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:84%
But, again, the quality of
the water is what matters.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.625 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: The quality of
water is very important.

00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So best if it's
structured properly.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.395 align:middle line:84%
You know like add
something to it.

00:24:02.395 --> 00:24:03.884 align:middle line:90%
Put a crystal in your water.

00:24:03.884 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:90%
That can help too.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
restructuring devices

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that are coming out from
Germany and from Russia.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.924 align:middle line:84%
There's some from
United States, as well.

00:24:14.924 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Just do some research.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:90%
They all work to an extent.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:90%
They all do different things.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these are all
water structuring devices?

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, all
water structuring devices.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: They
have different bases,

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.919 align:middle line:84%
but they pretty much
all work the same way.

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some are super
low tech and some are not.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Some are expensive.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:29.332 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Very high tech.

00:24:29.332 --> 00:24:30.123 align:middle line:90%
Some are expensive.

00:24:30.123 --> 00:24:31.363 align:middle line:90%
It depends on your budget.

00:24:31.363 --> 00:24:31.806 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:31.806 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: But I
highly recommend it.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So make it clean,
make it absorbable,

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and if possible, maybe
at add minerals to it.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: That's kind
of my top three things.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.164 align:middle line:90%
You remineralize the body.

00:24:42.164 --> 00:24:42.871 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:24:42.871 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
the best thing ever

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is clean spring water
if you can get that.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
You get earth energies,
you get the natural water,

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.077 align:middle line:84%
and you get things that you
can't get out of a machine.

00:24:53.077 --> 00:24:53.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:55.118 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel the difference.

00:24:55.118 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful if
you have access.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%
The next thing is sun.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk to
you about sunlight.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.646 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course,
it's been demonized.

00:25:01.646 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
The medical industry, cancer,
run, run from the sun!

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
this has always been

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
a critical part of not
just feeling healing,

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
but our absolute source
of life on this planet.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:84%
We can't live without
the effects of sunshine.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about sun.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:16.336 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Sun.

00:25:16.336 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And the sunlight is
part of our formula.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about
sun, we don't just

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:90%
talk about exposure to sunlight.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:84%
We also explain that
all living being

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:90%
is a concentration of light.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:90%
This is what we basically are.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Like space and light.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.026 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:34.026 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you go down to
like completely basic things.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, at
an atomic level,

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:90%
it is all space and light.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.536 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: 99% space.

00:25:39.536 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.448 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So we've got fruits,
and vegetables, and plants

00:25:43.448 --> 00:25:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that are basically this
charged sunlight pieces.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
They absorb the sun and they
materialize it and they make it

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:90%
into matter.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:90%
How amazing is that?

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So part of the sunlight
story is eating

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:84%
things that are
grown in sunshine.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.220 align:middle line:84%
That had been able
to get that light,

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:90%
and that energy in that form.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And you can take it in.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And the second part is getting
regular exposure on your skin.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Because we are light beings.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.421 align:middle line:84%
And we are meant to
have that in our system.

00:26:11.421 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.086 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And you know, if
you start really researching,

00:26:15.086 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that the
rise in skin cancer

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.846 align:middle line:84%
was also proportionate to the
sales of all the different skin

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:22.345 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:26:22.345 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the sunscreens.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.178 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:26:24.178 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's also not
just, I'm not saying

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
that it's a direct
effect of that.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
It's combination of stuff
that we've been doing.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.119 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to isolate
things, as always.

00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Also a refined diet.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Refined sugars--

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.433 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in particular.

00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
a book ages ago,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:84%
a couple decades ago about sugar
and taking in refined sugars.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And the effect on the skin.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of skin problems
resulted from that.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes
and heavy metals.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.415 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Like
all those things

00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:84%
are playing a part in
rising of the skin cancer.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So
sunlight is actually

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
if you don't
over-expose yourself,

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:84%
but expose your whole
body to it can literally

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.036 align:middle line:90%
recharge the body.

00:27:02.036 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:90%
The body is like a battery.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:90%
The cells are like the battery.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And you get those
biophotons from the sun.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.227 align:middle line:84%
They go straight into
the cells and recharge.

00:27:11.227 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: That's why
they go on vacations.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we get recharged.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And we come back all tanned
and happy and people usually--

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then sit
indoors for the next 50 weeks.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.279 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: I know.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:90%
How crazy is that?

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:90%
We do stuff like that.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But even if you're not
somewhere in a tropical climate,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
you can still if
it's sunny outside,

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.866 align:middle line:90%
come outside and enjoy.

00:27:29.866 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even
for a few minutes.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Even a few minutes.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just bathe your face
in the sun for a few minutes.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
It changes your whole
hormonal cascade.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:84%
You get serotonin, endorphins,
just being in the sunshine.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that brings
me to a couple of things.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
we're going to talk

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:90%
about the frequency of food.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I love this topic
because really it

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.580 align:middle line:84%
comes down to just
frequency and energy.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.830 align:middle line:90%
That's all any of this is.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.620 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.670 align:middle line:90%
That's all we are.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.120 align:middle line:84%
But also when you're
talking about the foods,

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.734 align:middle line:84%
you actually charge some of
your foods in the sun, as well.

00:28:00.734 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that they
were grown in the sun.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.524 align:middle line:84%
Before consuming, you
charge them in the sun.

00:28:04.524 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well that's actually
a very old tradition that

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
came out from what's supposed
to be an Essene culture.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Essene.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Essene, yes.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Essene-- there's been a lot
of research lately talking

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.931 align:middle line:84%
how Jesus Christ was
part of an Essene tribe.

00:28:19.931 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were given for
generations specific

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
instructions and this was in
the Essene Gospel of Peace that

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:84%
was found in I guess it
was in Israel somewhere

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:90%
they found this.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The nagamadi.

00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:33.453 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:28:33.453 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they were
given specific instructions

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
on how to be, how to
live, what to consume

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:84%
to be able to conceive a being
of such light as Jesus Christ.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So you had to be a pure
vehicle to be able to do that.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So part of their way of
living is living foods.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And foods that are
charged in light.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.757 align:middle line:84%
The Essene bread is
actually a lot of bread

00:28:56.757 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that's being sold
nowadays as Essene bread--

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.141 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: --is basically
sprouted wheat berries

00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that are cooked in the sun
in a very specific way.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And they will also
have this whole history

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.880 align:middle line:84%
of charging your
fruits and vegetables,

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:84%
putting outside to get
those biophotons in the food

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:14.269 align:middle line:84%
and that energy and to be
able to consume that later on.

00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
where it came from.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And you could
actually see it also

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.125 align:middle line:90%
in GDV, Dr. Korotkov's device.

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Konstantin
Korotkov's device.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, so if you
expose something in sunlight,

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.780 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see
the biophoton emission

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:90%
is completely different.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: You know,
it's massively different.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.383 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Massively.

00:29:31.383 --> 00:29:34.114 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this even with
Kirlian photography with foods.

00:29:34.114 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, with foods.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting
into the stuff I love.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:38.928 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:29:38.928 --> 00:29:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk
about what certain foods look

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.160 align:middle line:84%
like when you're looking
at their light spectrum

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:84%
versus what other
foods look like.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And the frequency range
we should ideally stay in.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So there has
been a lot of research.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, with Kirlian photography
and with frequencies,

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of course, Rife
machines and Royal Rife.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.109 align:middle line:84%
His research goes
back into '50s where

00:30:01.109 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:84%
he was trying to figure
out different frequencies

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:90%
and how it affects the body.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So this particular technology
from Brian Taychi-- I

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:84%
can have never pronounce
his name right.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But the technology
is called BT3.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a device that is
measuring a megahertz

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
output in human body,
in food, in anything

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:90%
that's basically alive.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, has enzymes in it.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So he had found that
on average, people

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that are healthy range
between 62 to 68 megahertz.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the frequency
they vibrate at.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he also separated like
the brain, and the descending

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
colon, they all vibrate
at different rates.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Like the brain, for
example, is usually highest.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:84%
It's between like
it's in high 70s.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like 75 to 80.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.110 align:middle line:84%
That's how the brain
is vibrating at.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And then he was
also looking at what

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.400 align:middle line:90%
diseased state looked like.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:84%
When body would be getting
close to 20 megahertz,

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that's usually the start of
the disease condition of death.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:84%
You know that
death would follow.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:84%
People at 45 megahertz
were getting Candida.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So he was actually
getting really

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:84%
specific in all those
different things.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And he goes like, OK, well,
if we have these frequencies,

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:84%
let's see what can help
us and look at the foods.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Foods, and how prayer changes
how our thoughts and beliefs,

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and how things
like essential oils

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:84%
can change our body
as well, if there's

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:90%
a frequency embedded into it.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:34.012 align:middle line:84%
And it would make sense that
if you are at a low frequency,

00:31:34.012 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:84%
if you do something that's
a little bit higher,

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
it will bring you
back into balance.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So he found that most
of fresh tree fruits

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.996 align:middle line:84%
were vibrating at
about 80 megahertz.

00:31:45.996 --> 00:31:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Most tree fruits?

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.828 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:31:47.828 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Most tree fruits were
vibrating around 80 megahertz.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And all the fresh fruits were
vibrating at a very high state.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.864 align:middle line:90%
Like anywhere from 30 to 80.

00:31:55.864 --> 00:31:58.280 align:middle line:84%
There's like-- there's vibrates,
obviously different ones.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let me
ask you while we're on it,

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:90%
root vegetables.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.837 align:middle line:84%
Things that are growing in the
earth, what frequency range

00:32:04.837 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:90%
they do they tend to vibrate at?

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: They will
go between the 40 to 75.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So there's
different ones.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: You know, like
and they're all helpful.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.125 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing too, even

00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
the animal products that are say
between the 45 to 50 megahertz,

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.320 align:middle line:84%
but then he was looking,
OK, let's look at the colon.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.254 align:middle line:84%
The colon is between
actually 50 to 55.

00:32:24.254 --> 00:32:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So there's
certain things,

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
you can see how you can use
certain things for healing

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:84%
certain parts depending
on the frequency of them.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Like how they work together.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
things that they

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.760 align:middle line:84%
were doing that was
very interesting.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.670 align:middle line:84%
They would have one
subject drink coffee

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and he would be at
75 megahertz and then

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:47.970 align:middle line:84%
his frequency would drop
down to 66 megahertz.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Then he would inhale
an essential oil

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and his frequency in within
30 seconds will go back up.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.006 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Essential oils are
very, very high in frequency.

00:33:01.006 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Extremely high.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And then
they did another control

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.384 align:middle line:90%
subject did the same thing.

00:33:05.384 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Drank the same coffee,
but didn't inhale.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
His frequency did come back
to where it was before,

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:90%
but it took three days.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:12.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting

00:33:12.925 --> 00:33:13.925 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Interesting.

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:16.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like all this kind of
like little minute things.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.730 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.610 align:middle line:90%
So same with prayer.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.640 align:middle line:84%
They found that just by
praying and by focusing

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.310 align:middle line:84%
on positive things,
you would go up

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.837 align:middle line:90%
50 megahertz in your vibration.

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.315 align:middle line:84%
And you actually have
some illustrations

00:33:28.315 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:90%
of this in your book.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.840 align:middle line:84%
One in particular,
side by side, sprouted

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.970 align:middle line:90%
lentils and their light output.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
hamburger next to it

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
which you can't really
see a lot of light

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.390 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the hamburger.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.139 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah,
commercial foods are all

00:33:41.139 --> 00:33:46.090 align:middle line:84%
coming like almost close to like
one, two, three, like very low.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Very dense.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Just there's not much
health and light.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it too.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is really the basis.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Even though it may not
be explained that way,

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that is the basis of
the raw food movement.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you said the
key word earlier.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's living
has active enzymes in it.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.219 align:middle line:84%
And so enzymes are
another really big part

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:09.080 align:middle line:90%
of the protocol.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And also the lifting
of the frequencies.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk-- that's
your favorite subject.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Enzymes
and probiotics.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.898 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about.

00:34:14.898 --> 00:34:17.185 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well,
the enzymes were

00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:90%
a huge part of my own recovery.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Before I found
enzymatic therapy,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I was basically making
one step forward,

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.639 align:middle line:84%
two steps back with all
of my detox and practices.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I found a gentleman
by the name of Dr. Michael

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:35.005 align:middle line:84%
O'Brien who had done a lot
of research on this enzymes

00:34:35.005 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and he's just one of
the most amazing beings.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
Katrine, your enzymes

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:41.409 align:middle line:84%
are all wiped out
because of radiation.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Because your body's
been trying so hard

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.469 align:middle line:84%
to remediate what's happened
to you and to rebuild.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.310 align:middle line:84%
There is no workers
left in your body.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So you have to put
the workers back in.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.980 align:middle line:90%
So enzymes are like the workers.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.659 align:middle line:90%
They do everything in the body.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:59.124 align:middle line:84%
If you have minerals like
calcium or vitamins, vitamin D,

00:34:59.124 --> 00:35:00.540 align:middle line:84%
they are like the
building blocks.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Amino acid's the building
blocks of the body.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The enzymes are the workers
that put everything into places.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy is
if you have a house

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.634 align:middle line:84%
and you brought all
the materials down

00:35:09.634 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and come back in a week
later, nothing is happening.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Why is nothing happening?

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:13.630 align:middle line:90%
No workers.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No workers.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So are you talking
about systemic enzymes

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.309 align:middle line:84%
at this point or
digestive enzymes?

00:35:18.309 --> 00:35:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: It's actually both.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Both?

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:21.868 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Systemic
and digestive.

00:35:21.868 --> 00:35:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So your body can actually
make two types of enzymes.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Digestive enzymes or
metabolic enzymes.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So it can either choose to use
its reserves to digest things.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.731 align:middle line:90%
Or it can fix things.

00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:38.340 align:middle line:84%
The more we spend our own
enzymatic potential on foods

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:42.339 align:middle line:84%
to digest, the less is left
for metabolic functions.

00:35:42.339 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about someone

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.167 align:middle line:84%
who goes to
McDonald's for lunch.

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And say, if you have
a lifestyle where

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
you have coffee and a
bagel in the morning

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.375 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe have
a hamburger or even

00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:90%
a low quality salad for lunch.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.588 align:middle line:84%
What is the body struggling
with there enzymatically?

00:35:58.588 --> 00:35:59.546 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Oh my gosh!

00:35:59.546 --> 00:36:00.045 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:00.045 --> 00:36:01.965 align:middle line:84%
There's like a whole
load of stuff in there.

00:36:01.965 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the point is
you're stressed and challenged

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.200 align:middle line:90%
from the get-go.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.810 align:middle line:84%
You really can't catch up during
the day then, I wouldn't--

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: No, you can't.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.900 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you have
to digest all that.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, you don't
know what's in there.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.410 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of contaminants
and where it's going to go.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, the body does
not have time to deal with it

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and will put it in a
nice, little fat cell.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And say, I'll deal with
it later and guess what?

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.240 align:middle line:90%
That's how we get obesity.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's how we get the
pudge around the middle too.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Exactly.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And we just continue
building it and building it.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And all the time, you just
get all this toxic material

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.120 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So with those hamburgers,
again, your body

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.360 align:middle line:84%
has to spend its own
enzymes to digest it.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.667 align:middle line:84%
Then there's also toxic
load on the system.

00:36:45.667 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.416 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Right And it
also depends on the person.

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Some people always say, well, my
grandfather was 100 years old,

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and he ate this and that,
and smoked, and drank,

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and-- well, he probably had a
different enzymatic potential.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.897 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't grow up
enzymatically deficient foods.

00:37:00.897 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.021 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Like my generation
is the generation that grew up

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.500 align:middle line:90%
on enzymatically deficient food.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Through soil deprivation.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.205 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Soil, yes.

00:37:09.205 --> 00:37:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Through having a
lot of those processed foods

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:84%
in our diets Through having
a lot of cooked diets.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Cooked food's not enough.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Fresh, raw, vibrant
foods, and also

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.464 align:middle line:84%
through not having
proper gut flora.

00:37:20.464 --> 00:37:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So you've got all
of this happening in one person.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:30.812 align:middle line:84%
And the obvious consequence
of that is diabetes, obesity--

00:37:30.812 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Attention
Deficit Disorder,

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.080 align:middle line:90%
it's all happening parallel.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
recommend definitely

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:90%
doing digestive enzymes.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.094 align:middle line:84%
First of all, to
take that load of--

00:37:41.094 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: The digestive
enzymes, by the time

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
you're 40 years
old, and you only

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:50.030 align:middle line:84%
have 30% of your whole enzymatic
potential left in your body.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:53.610 align:middle line:84%
You just use it up over
time, so it makes sense

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:56.120 align:middle line:84%
that it would be good to
supplement from the outside.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways to
supplement from outside

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.910 align:middle line:84%
is having highly
enzymatically effective foods.

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Like raw foods,
juices, fresh juices.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Fermented foods, they're
full of-- probiotics

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.450 align:middle line:84%
are kind of like enzyme
packages in a way.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And also because it took us a
long way to get where we're at.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It's almost not enough
to just do that anymore.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Like in my case, I was
already doing the raw foods,

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I was already doing
juicing, I was already

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
fasting for like
45 days on water.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.996 align:middle line:84%
But it was still not
making big progress.

00:38:27.996 --> 00:38:29.412 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
took supplements?

00:38:29.412 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.029 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up to a place
where I said, OK, I actually

00:38:32.029 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:90%
do need extra help.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.430 align:middle line:84%
That I have so
little enzymes left,

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:38.405 align:middle line:84%
that I need to take digestive
enzymes to basically fill up

00:38:38.405 --> 00:38:39.095 align:middle line:90%
my bank account.

00:38:39.095 --> 00:38:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.969 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: You know, because
a lot of times, our mind

00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is writing checks
our body can't cash.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.619 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:38:44.619 --> 00:38:45.493 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: You know?

00:38:45.493 --> 00:38:47.540 align:middle line:84%
With a lot of things that
are happening nowadays.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So taking digestive
enzymes with your foods

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.970 align:middle line:84%
helps you to digest
them, takes pressure off

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.230 align:middle line:84%
of your metabolic enzymes,
so it can go and do

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.640 align:middle line:90%
things that need to do.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And also replenishes
your bank account

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.030 align:middle line:90%
if you take a lot of them too.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Your enzymatic bank account.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So there is more available
for those metabolic processes.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Because the body is very smart.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It will take digestive
enzyme and it

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:14.020 align:middle line:84%
will make it into metabolic
if it's necessary to.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:84%
The systemic enzymes, those
are a little bit different.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Those are not usually
taken with foods.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:20.460 align:middle line:90%
They go--

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
taken, you're supposed

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:84%
to take them not with
foods as a matter of fact.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.098 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:39:24.098 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And those are incredible
for inflammation issues.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:90%
There's like for--

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For leaky gut.

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: For leaky gut.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For all
kinds of things, yeah.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: For pain
issues and those

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:84%
are just like amazing little
workers that go into the body

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.007 align:middle line:90%
and clean stuff up.

00:39:38.007 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: All the
undigested proteins.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Necrotic tissues.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Necrotic tissues.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.855 align:middle line:84%
They go and eat it up and
get it all out basically.

00:39:45.855 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And you can
actually feel massive changes

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:84%
just by introducing
those into your protocol.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.922 align:middle line:90%
And probiotics.

00:39:53.922 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Probiotics.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.421 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean we
talked about some

00:39:56.421 --> 00:39:57.816 align:middle line:90%
of them, the fermented foods.

00:39:57.816 --> 00:39:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you have to go into
supplementation as well.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.002 align:middle line:84%
What do most adults
need some kind of help?

00:40:02.002 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say pretty much everyone
nowadays needs gut help.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gut help yeah.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:09.230 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's a big topic.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Part of is gluten sensitivity.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened with us
over time and all the gluten.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd recommend checking out
the Gluten Free Summit.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.192 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
wonderful minds that

00:40:22.192 --> 00:40:23.900 align:middle line:84%
are talking about the
gut health and what

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.159 align:middle line:90%
had happened over time--

00:40:25.159 --> 00:40:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Gluten
Free Summit is online,

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:27.820 align:middle line:90%
available on YouTube?

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, it's online.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:90%
It's available.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.937 align:middle line:84%
And you can listen to all
these experts, it's amazing.

00:40:31.937 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It just happened and
they have it available,

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.070 align:middle line:90%
so you can go check it out.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have all the
things that we've

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.100 align:middle line:84%
been doing to ourselves over
time that have completely

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.010 align:middle line:90%
changed our gut flora.

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And the gut flora is necessary
to digest certain nutrients.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:53.210 align:middle line:84%
To give us protection from
onslaught of different viruses

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:54.730 align:middle line:90%
and bacterias.

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like if
enzymes are workers,

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.180 align:middle line:84%
then probiotics are
soldiers in a lot of ways.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.306 align:middle line:90%
They fight a lot of things.

00:41:01.306 --> 00:41:03.721 align:middle line:84%
And then there's all these
different types of priobiotics.

00:41:03.721 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:84%
There's special types of
probiotics in your gut flora

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with
digestion of fats.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
enough of those,

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:12.560 align:middle line:84%
then you don't digest
your fats very well.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's all
these factors that

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.820 align:middle line:90%
are kind of playing into it.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have a lot
of antibiotic use in our food

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.390 align:middle line:90%
sources like dairy.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Most of the dairy nowadays,
unless it's organic,

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.890 align:middle line:90%
has been exposed to antibiotics.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Antibiotics are overused
in a doctor's setting.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time that's
what they end up giving you.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is not the way to
go about it unless you're

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
in completely a place
where you absolutely need.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.655 align:middle line:84%
And there is times when you
absolutely need antibiotics--

00:41:41.655 --> 00:41:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.863 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: There
is no way around it.

00:41:43.863 --> 00:41:46.050 align:middle line:84%
But for like little
things, like ear infections

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.008 align:middle line:84%
and this and that, you
shouldn't be using that.

00:41:48.008 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So we overuse antibiotics and
we have killed our gut flora.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And it also had mutated
to a point where

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.455 align:middle line:84%
we have a flora that's
resistant to antibiotics.

00:41:56.455 --> 00:41:57.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:57.038 --> 00:42:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So it's a huge
subject, the whole gut health.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is, yeah.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So
pretty much everyone

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.080 align:middle line:90%
nowadays needs a good probiotic.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Especially women.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:09.640 align:middle line:84%
We tend to be a little bit
more sensitive than men.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be we also have
a lot of Candida issues.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Candida yes.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY:
Sensitivities to sugars.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.070 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole other topic
too, but probiotic helps a lot.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So fermented food's
amazing for that.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And by fermented foods,
I'm not saying yogurt.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:84%
That is not, unless
you made it yourself.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking
more like fermented cabbages,

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:28.272 align:middle line:90%
sauerkraut, kimchis.

00:42:28.272 --> 00:42:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Unless you make
your own probiotic yogurt

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.220 align:middle line:90%
with coconut.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.425 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Very easy
to just take a coconut,

00:42:33.425 --> 00:42:36.390 align:middle line:84%
blend it, add some probiotic
culture to it, let it sit.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.419 align:middle line:84%
You've got your own
probiotic yogurt.

00:42:38.419 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one thing
I want to go back to here

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.570 align:middle line:84%
is that at the same
time, we're talking

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:84%
about the vibrancy of
all these living foods

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and foods that grow on trees
and sprouted things and greens.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:52.450 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, there's
also a growing need for people

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to start reintroducing animal
proteins into their diet

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and body.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Many people are needing
through this transition

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.530 align:middle line:84%
we're going through lots of
animal based protein as well.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
movement toward paleo.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding is not that
you axe out the living foods,

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:84%
but that you are balancing the
need for the cooked proteins

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.677 align:middle line:84%
and even cooked vegetables
with the live foods.

00:43:15.677 --> 00:43:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Well, I always say,
eat according to your purpose.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:18.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:18.843 --> 00:43:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So for
most of the population,

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:84%
there is a need to
go on a vegan diet

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.950 align:middle line:84%
for at least certain amount
of time to clean out.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Vegan and
especially raw food diet

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.330 align:middle line:84%
or like a high percentage
of living foods,

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.260 align:middle line:84%
they're really
good for cleansing.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But for most individuals,
it's impossible to stay

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.030 align:middle line:90%
on that diet.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It's just not
proper for the metabolic set up.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not good for our
lifestyle, for our endocrine

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.240 align:middle line:90%
needs, as well, because--

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Endocrine, yeah.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.376 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah,
endocrine needs.

00:43:49.376 --> 00:43:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we do get a lot
of exposure to stress.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's chemical or
just our fast-paced life,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of people
with adrenal fatigue.

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.920 align:middle line:90%
I deal with that a lot.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Adrenal fatigue and
adrenal exhaustion.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, you
can't build the body back up

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.844 align:middle line:90%
with just living foods.

00:44:10.844 --> 00:44:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:12.010 align:middle line:90%
You need the proteins.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So that's
when you need the proteins

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:14.340 align:middle line:90%
from and fats.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.945 align:middle line:90%
Also fats are very important.

00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:19.323 align:middle line:84%
Are very important animal,
good, high quality fats.

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.011 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Like butter.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.119 align:middle line:84%
And we've been told
to fear butter.

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:23.827 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:26.077 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And butter is
actually, when it's grassfed

00:44:26.077 --> 00:44:27.850 align:middle line:90%
and or if can be raw or ghee.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:31.190 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing building block.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is, for example,
is mostly water and fat.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:35.620 align:middle line:90%
And you need it.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's finding
that perfect balance

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and when I work with
people, I always

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:43.600 align:middle line:84%
say there's three different
cycles that your body is in.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.230 align:middle line:84%
You're either feeding
the body so you

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.189 align:middle line:84%
can get to place
where you can cleanse.

00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Or you're cleansing
the body because you've

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.680 align:middle line:84%
got so much stuff and you
need to get some stuff out.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Or you're building.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:55.760 align:middle line:90%
You're building a new structure.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So depending on
where you're at, you

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.520 align:middle line:84%
start in different--
there's different diets.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's a
very good distinction to make.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.026 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah, but
for most of individuals,

00:45:03.026 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:84%
if they cut out gluten and
dairy and introduce more living

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:12.110 align:middle line:84%
foods, they will feel a massive
shift in their health if they

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.360 align:middle line:90%
live in like normal standard--

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.266 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: --American diet.

00:45:15.266 --> 00:45:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And then once
you've cleansed out

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and once you're in a
good balanced state,

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:84%
you can reintroduce
those animal products

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.986 align:middle line:84%
and just find that
perfect fuel mix.

00:45:24.986 --> 00:45:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah some
people do better on fish.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Others do better on meat.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.534 align:middle line:90%
On red meat.

00:45:29.534 --> 00:45:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: We're all
different biochemically,

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.544 align:middle line:84%
there's not one diet
that suits one person.

00:45:33.544 --> 00:45:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And we all have
different lifestyles too.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.346 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:37.346 --> 00:45:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: It has to be
really truly-- like what

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.920 align:middle line:84%
you do with living foods and
with high-vibrational foods,

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.560 align:middle line:84%
you get closer to your natural
state of high vibration.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.680 align:middle line:84%
You're able to hear the messages
your body and your higher self

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.250 align:middle line:90%
gives you of what you need.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.050 align:middle line:90%
What your body--

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes because
you're more sensitized then.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Because
then you're not

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.980 align:middle line:84%
listening to a nutritionist,
and a doctor, and a TV,

00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.720 align:middle line:90%
and a commercial.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.560 align:middle line:90%
You're listening to yourself.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
most important factors

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.175 align:middle line:84%
that living foods
bring into your life.

00:46:06.175 --> 00:46:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.814 align:middle line:90%
One final little topic.

00:46:08.814 --> 00:46:09.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not little.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
struggled with this.

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.989 align:middle line:84%
We are naturally
drawn, as a species,

00:46:13.989 --> 00:46:15.030 align:middle line:90%
to things that are sweet.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It used to be in ancient times,
it was a draw for survival.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The sweet things were
safe, the bitter things

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.210 align:middle line:90%
were not necessarily safe.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:23.710 align:middle line:90%
So this is innate to us.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And we find it in our comfort
structure to want sweets.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But you are coming across
some low glycemic options

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.850 align:middle line:90%
that are not as well known.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us know about Stevia,
but don't like the aftertaste.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us know
about coconut sugar,

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:38.415 align:middle line:90%
for example, which is good.

00:46:38.415 --> 00:46:43.304 align:middle line:84%
It's a good low glycemic
index sweetener.

00:46:43.304 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: But still sugar.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.640 align:middle line:90%
But there are a couple others.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And maybe just to
finish the topic,

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.860 align:middle line:84%
talk about what we can do
to keep a little sweetness

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.052 align:middle line:84%
in the mix of all of this
and not damage the body.

00:46:53.052 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Absolutely.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:90%
And life has to be sweet.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: And I love sweets.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:00.790 align:middle line:90%
And I like having fun.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's always been my
passion to find things

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that you can use every day
and have enjoyment still.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So for most of
people, we've been

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.610 align:middle line:84%
overusing the sugar,
that's just part of it.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And to get back
into the balance,

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.430 align:middle line:84%
you need to find options that
will not throw your blood

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:21.850 align:middle line:84%
sugar off and help you
get to a place of healing.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you can use
sparingly high glycemic things

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:29.040 align:middle line:84%
like honey, and dates,
and like natural things.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.880 align:middle line:84%
But to get to that
place, there's

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.931 align:middle line:84%
some great low glycemic
options that you can use.

00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Obviously one is Stevia.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:90%
People don't like that.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.820 align:middle line:84%
The other one that I
found a few years ago

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.200 align:middle line:84%
is a Japanese product
called Lakanto

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and it's a mix of erythritol.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:45.112 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Erythritol?

00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Erythritol.

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:54.040 align:middle line:84%
This is an alcohol sugar, but
it is naturally fermented.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And it is easier
on digestive track.

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Its cousin is Xylitol.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And Xylitol is a
lot of times made

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.040 align:middle line:90%
using hydrogenation processes.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.614 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't
like how it makes them feel.

00:48:04.614 --> 00:48:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.488 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: There's a little
bit of digestive stress.

00:48:07.488 --> 00:48:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So erythritol seems to be
easier on the digestive track.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And Lakanto is erythritol
and monk fruit extract.

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Monk fruit extract is actually--

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Monk fruit, most
people aren't familiar with.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah,
this is actually

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:19.880 align:middle line:84%
going to be the new big
player, you will see.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:20.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:22.448 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: In a year or
so, because more of it

00:48:22.448 --> 00:48:23.480 align:middle line:90%
could be coming in here.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It's an Asian fruit
from China that

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:90%
is a national treasure in China.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's 300 times
sweeter than sugar.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And the sweetness doesn't
come from fructose or sucrose.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.460 align:middle line:90%
It comes from antioxidants.

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And the antioxidants
are called mongrosides.

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.139 align:middle line:84%
Those are a specific
type of antioxidants.

00:48:43.139 --> 00:48:46.015 align:middle line:84%
So you actually get antioxidant
activity and sweetness.

00:48:46.015 --> 00:48:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: So it's a
very amazing sweetener.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:53.430 align:middle line:84%
When it's really well done,
it's neutral in taste.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's also really sweet.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:90%
You only need just a tiny bit.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you also
involved in with a lot

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of the people that
are chocolatiers,

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.284 align:middle line:84%
but in the natural chocolate
using raw cacao movement.

00:49:04.284 --> 00:49:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes.

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's being
used in some of them, which

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.580 align:middle line:90%
is really exciting.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.962 align:middle line:90%
Now are those on your website?

00:49:08.962 --> 00:49:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yes, those
are on my website.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And you
can check it out.

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.771 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
I want people to be

00:49:13.771 --> 00:49:15.682 align:middle line:84%
able to connect with
the sweet stuff, too.

00:49:15.682 --> 00:49:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VOLYNSKY: Yeah.

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:19.104 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I thank you
so much for taking the time

00:49:19.104 --> 00:49:19.770 align:middle line:90%
to talk with us.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:22.370 align:middle line:84%
There's much, much more in
your book, I mean, obviously.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But that just gives
us a little taste

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:25.670 align:middle line:84%
of some of the
real basics that we

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:27.170 align:middle line:90%
need to take into consideration.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So highly recommend anybody
pick up a copy of your book.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:34.290 align:middle line:84%
You and Wade both did a
really good job on it.

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VOLYNSKY: And thank
you for having us.

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.423 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Katrine
definitely walks her talk.

00:49:39.423 --> 00:49:41.920 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in her shiny
skin and sparkling eyes.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I found "Staying Alive
in a Toxic World"

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.830 align:middle line:84%
to be incredibly
clear and useful.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't overwhelm you
with data after more data.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Just practical knowledge.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.820 align:middle line:84%
You can pick up a copy
at katrinevolynsky.com.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
