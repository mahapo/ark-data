>> Regina Meredith: Dr. William
Tiller is a former professor

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:25.559 align:middle line:84%
of material science
and engineering

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:26.861 align:middle line:90%
at Stanford University.

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:28.562 align:middle line:90%
That was his day job.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.698 align:middle line:84%
His real work, however,
was in coming

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:33.367 align:middle line:84%
to understand how one
can change the nature

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.436 align:middle line:90%
of materials with the mind.

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:38.405 align:middle line:84%
This is some of the most
profound work on the planet.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.674 align:middle line:84%
As the person who created
what has become known

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.743 align:middle line:84%
as various intention
experiments,

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:45.346 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Tiller has aligned
himself with Suzy Miller

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:47.581 align:middle line:84%
for a radical new
approach to understanding

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:51.886 align:middle line:84%
and reversing the effects of
autism in what is now called the

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:53.787 align:middle line:90%
"Autism Intention Experiments."

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.489 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.994 align:middle line:84%
I have seen you, at a distance
here and there at conventions,

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and even private gathering,
but it really wasn't --

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.632 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was
meant to be for us

00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:06.467 align:middle line:84%
to come together
until right now.

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:07.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
When fullness is.

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:08.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
That's right.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.603 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles] When fullness is.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:13.073 align:middle line:84%
Now just about everybody
in the world

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:17.178 align:middle line:84%
of what has been I think
erroneously called pseudoscience

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:19.613 align:middle line:84%
that are doing these
bold new experiments.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.215 align:middle line:90%
Everybody turns to you.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:22.983 align:middle line:90%
They quote you.

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.319 align:middle line:84%
They post your papers
and so forth

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.522 align:middle line:84%
to validate what they
have come to understand,

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:31.825 align:middle line:84%
and that is really high
praise in a field that has

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.861 align:middle line:84%
so many brilliant people
coming to the surface

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.331 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is you beat
them there [chuckles] you beat

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.399 align:middle line:90%
them there.

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.067 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this for 40 years now.

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:41.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Yeah, a little over.

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:42.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: A
little over 40 years.

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:44.772 align:middle line:84%
If you would please tell
the people who don't know

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:46.974 align:middle line:84%
who you are just yet --
who are just meeting you

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:50.277 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, give us
an idea of your background.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:53.379 align:middle line:84%
You're highly credible in
the world of science already,

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.817 align:middle line:84%
and big deal to cross
over into this other area.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:57.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Okay.

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:01.155 align:middle line:90%
Well the -- I was in industry

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:03.991 align:middle line:84%
for nine years before
I went to Stanford.

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:07.895 align:middle line:84%
That was at Westinghouse
Research Laboratories and I grew

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.731 align:middle line:84%
up in Toronto, Canada,
was educated in Toronto.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: What were
you working on at Westinghouse?

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: I
was working on the science

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:19.373 align:middle line:84%
of crystallization, and that
could be a 100 ton ingots

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:22.543 align:middle line:84%
of metal or it could be
single crystal silicones

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:23.777 align:middle line:90%
to go into devices.

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: The
computer industry and.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Et cetera,

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:27.414 align:middle line:90%
yes, exactly, so anything.

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:30.517 align:middle line:84%
Could be the purification
of water, seawater,

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:34.121 align:middle line:84%
by the freezing process
possibilities,

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:36.824 align:middle line:84%
any thermal electricity,
of all kinds.

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:38.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Crystallization of materials.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.095 align:middle line:84%
It's really a phase
transformation,

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:42.463 align:middle line:90%
a particular one.

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:49.036 align:middle line:84%
I've always loved crystals,
and I found out how they grow.

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: You
found out how they grow.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:52.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:53.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: So that
was work was all about that,

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.309 align:middle line:84%
mathematical, as well
as experimental, so.

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
This was at the dawning

00:02:56.644 --> 00:02:59.446 align:middle line:84%
of what would become the
commercial computer age.

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It was indeed part

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:90%
of that beginning, yeah.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.987 align:middle line:84%
It was -- the beginning
of it was where the growth

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:13.594 align:middle line:84%
of crystals was an art, and
the foundry things were an art,

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:17.431 align:middle line:90%
castings was an art.

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:23.203 align:middle line:84%
My work and those working with
me began to make it a science.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Well it's interesting

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.441 align:middle line:84%
because without going into a
whole discourse on crystals,

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:29.543 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what we'll
end up talking about,

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:34.581 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the new
understandings about this other.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I
don't want to say field

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.885 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
buzz word for you.

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:39.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yeah.

00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:40.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: That
other area frequency has to do

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:42.756 align:middle line:90%
with the sacred geometry,

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:45.925 align:middle line:84%
such as the hexagonal
form in the crystal.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:54.635 align:middle line:84%
I found -- the analogy that I
have is that the transformation

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:57.705 align:middle line:84%
of a human from one
stage of reality

00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:03.944 align:middle line:84%
to another is not totally unlike
the transformation of a material

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:09.183 align:middle line:84%
from a liquid to a crystal
or from a gas to a solid.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:13.187 align:middle line:84%
It's a phase transformation, the
one with respect to the humans,

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:14.955 align:middle line:84%
it's just a little
more complicated.

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:16.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Okay, so when you talk

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:19.493 align:middle line:84%
about this phase transformation
of the human, are you talking

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:22.363 align:middle line:84%
in physical form or are
you talking in a more?

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:23.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: You have

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:24.698 align:middle line:84%
to expand beyond
the physical form.

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:25.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.767 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.869 align:middle line:84%
It's so you -- so the
theoretical modeling that I get

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:32.106 align:middle line:84%
into deals with higher
dimensions of reality

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:34.942 align:middle line:84%
because it is those
transformations

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:38.612 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about in
our evolutionary process.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.683 align:middle line:90%
We become something much more.

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:48.489 align:middle line:84%
To me -- well, we are
souls [door closes]

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.925 align:middle line:90%
and we have a body.

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:56.764 align:middle line:84%
To me, our spiritual
parents dressed us

00:04:56.764 --> 00:05:00.267 align:middle line:84%
in these bio bodysuits
and put us in this playpen

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:04.405 align:middle line:84%
that we call a universe in
order to grow in coherence,

00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:08.075 align:middle line:84%
in order to develop our gifts
of intentionality, and in order

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:10.778 align:middle line:84%
to become what we were
intended to become I believe

00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:13.981 align:middle line:84%
and that is co-creators
with our spiritual parents,

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.083 align:middle line:84%
and when you're talking
about creation,

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.818 align:middle line:90%
you're talking big time.

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:18.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller:

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.955 align:middle line:84%
That these higher
dimensional levels of reality.

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:25.893 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So were you
already aware of this or curious

00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:27.394 align:middle line:90%
about that even as a child?

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean did you come in with
this kind of great curiosity?

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
I had great curiosity.

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.269 align:middle line:84%
I loved to chase
butterflies, catch bees,

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:37.571 align:middle line:84%
but my mother thought
I'd be a biologist,

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't turn it that way.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.242 align:middle line:90%
I was a poet as a young man

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:47.548 align:middle line:84%
and decided I either become a
writer, or I become a scientist.

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.783 align:middle line:84%
If I could become a
-- if I come a writer,

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:51.185 align:middle line:90%
I could never be a scientist.

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:54.888 align:middle line:84%
If I become a scientist, maybe
one day I could be a writer, so.

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:55.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Which was true.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:90%
It turned out to be true.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Turns
out that's the path I took

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:03.297 align:middle line:84%
and so I went -- got all my
degree work at the University

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:07.434 align:middle line:84%
of Toronto in Engineering
Physics,

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.136 align:middle line:90%
so I'm basically a physicist.

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:15.008 align:middle line:84%
I think of myself as a
physicist, and when I decided

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:19.379 align:middle line:84%
to leave Westinghouse,
Stanford invited me to come

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:25.152 align:middle line:84%
to be a full professor at 33
and with tenure fortunately.

00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:26.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Amazing.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:28.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
And my wife always wanted

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:90%
to live in California.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what I wanted
to do, so I thought, "Well,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.464 align:middle line:84%
I'll try it for five
years," and so we went there

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:45.973 align:middle line:84%
and I found I loved the
atmosphere and the scholarship.

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:49.076 align:middle line:90%
It was quite lovely.

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
And I decided, "Okay.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.714 align:middle line:90%
It'll be more than five years."

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:54.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:56.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It was 34.

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:57.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Thirty-four
years, and as you stayed there,

00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:59.887 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot that
was quite interesting.

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:01.989 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
you had your own world.

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:04.958 align:middle line:84%
You and your wife have been
meditating for over 40 years.

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.328 align:middle line:84%
You had been working with
consciousness and attempting,

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:10.931 align:middle line:84%
not only attempting, but
learning to understand it

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and even create models
that did not exist

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.104 align:middle line:84%
and that people are still
grasping to understand now,

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:20.274 align:middle line:84%
and this moves beyond
the physics that we know

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:22.009 align:middle line:90%
into another area completely.

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.678 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I think of
this in this -- the --

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:27.648 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing with Suzy
Miller in this experiment,

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:29.917 align:middle line:84%
which does have to do
with remote healing,

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.919 align:middle line:90%
I think of remote viewing.

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Then I think
of Stanford Research Institute.

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:35.989 align:middle line:84%
Then I think of Russell
Targ, Keith Harary

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:40.861 align:middle line:84%
and all those fellows, and so
I would imagine your paths must

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:42.429 align:middle line:90%
have crossed a long time ago.

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Well it
did cross in an interesting way,

00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:46.466 align:middle line:84%
and I -- and the thing that
was interesting you should know

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:50.037 align:middle line:84%
that when my wife and I were
driving across the country

00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:54.107 align:middle line:84%
with our two kids in the back
of our Ford Fairlane, she said,

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:56.577 align:middle line:84%
"Bill, when we get
to California,

00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:59.846 align:middle line:84%
let's try to pull together the
spiritual side of our life."

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.048 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Yeah, that's
a good idea.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:04.718 align:middle line:84%
Let's do that," and
so when we got there,

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:09.122 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things we
did was to get back involved

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:11.291 align:middle line:90%
with the Edgar Cayce work.

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Yes, love it.

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller:

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.796 align:middle line:84%
And learned to meditate
using the Edgar Cayce work.

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:17.931 align:middle line:84%
I'd been at Stanford
a couple of years,

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:21.468 align:middle line:84%
and the man who brought me
in -- who had serious illness

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:24.304 align:middle line:84%
and they asked if I
would department chair

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:27.708 align:middle line:84%
because I'd had a group of a
dozen people at Westinghouse

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.977 align:middle line:84%
when I was -- by the
time I left there.

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:31.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: A young man.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: So I
had some experience with that,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.686 align:middle line:84%
and I took that on sort of
from the mid-60s to the '70s.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:45.993 align:middle line:84%
And I used my meditative
techniques because you --

00:08:45.993 --> 00:08:50.097 align:middle line:84%
with Cayce approach you can
learn to refocus your mind

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:55.002 align:middle line:84%
and you can learn to relax your
mind and just nourish people

00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:58.205 align:middle line:84%
if they're there, and so I
learned to switch back and forth

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:02.509 align:middle line:84%
so fast that I was seen to
be in both spaces at once.

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:05.145 align:middle line:84%
And therefore it turned
out to be very useful.

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:08.915 align:middle line:84%
It was useful when students
would come through the door

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:12.953 align:middle line:84%
and were hesitant about what
they wanted to talk about,

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:15.555 align:middle line:84%
and so I would -- had a
bit of intuition by then

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.391 align:middle line:84%
and I would say,
"What about this?

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:18.792 align:middle line:90%
Have you thought about that?"

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:22.062 align:middle line:84%
Et cetera, so -- and I used this
kind of thing in my consulting.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:25.932 align:middle line:84%
I became a consultant with the
DuPont Company for 25 years,

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and it was basically
again, working with people

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:36.276 align:middle line:84%
who were bright but down
on the mindset relative

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
to their abilities and so
part of it was to nourish them

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.849 align:middle line:90%
from emotional mind levels,

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:47.387 align:middle line:84%
show them pathways whereby
their work could have fruition,

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:51.391 align:middle line:90%
and develop trust with them.

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: But this
nourishing is what you're also

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.461 align:middle line:90%
doing today.

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:55.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: This
is very important work.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:57.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Because
it's very important part.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.399 align:middle line:90%
It allows you --

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:02.502 align:middle line:84%
the connectivity between
people requires --

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:05.305 align:middle line:84%
there is that nourishing
and there is the development

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:07.908 align:middle line:84%
of a oneness state
between you, so coherence.

00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a broadening of the
bandwidth now of two people,

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.516 align:middle line:90%
two parts into one broader band

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:18.719 align:middle line:84%
and much more information
can be exchanged

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:21.254 align:middle line:90%
in those circumstances.

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:23.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Now I'm
going to go back or leap back

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:24.558 align:middle line:84%
for just a sec, just
a little bit.

00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:25.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
You want to go back.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And
going tangential on Cayce,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce for a moment because
what I'm seeing, what's going

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.631 align:middle line:84%
through my mind is
here we're talking

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.034 align:middle line:84%
about the study of
crystallization.

00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:36.737 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about new
technologies that are emerging

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:39.406 align:middle line:84%
on the planet and Edgar
Cayce talked about these

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:42.008 align:middle line:84%
in great length in very
ancient civilizations.

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:43.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Absolutely.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:44.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Very ancient
sophisticated civilizations.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.213 align:middle line:90%
He also, even though it was

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:48.949 align:middle line:84%
against his Christian
principles,

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
initially had problems with it
-- had to let the readings stand

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.387 align:middle line:84%
on their own, which
we're talking

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:55.722 align:middle line:84%
about reincarnation
and patterns.

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:56.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: He
didn't believe in it originally.

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:59.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: He
did not, and to have all

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:02.529 align:middle line:84%
of these brilliant physicists
and scientists coming

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:06.066 align:middle line:84%
through in America specifically
was what Cayce was talking

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:07.434 align:middle line:90%
about almost 100 years ago --

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:10.904 align:middle line:84%
80 to 100 years ago to bring
these technologies forward...

00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:11.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Exactly.

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:12.672 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: ...so I
mean of course I look at you,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.641 align:middle line:90%
and I think, "Hmm, wonder

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:15.709 align:middle line:84%
who he might've been
[chuckles] once upon a time,

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:90%
can't help it."

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:18.345 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So this
knowledge is reemerging

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:21.248 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:11:21.248 --> 00:11:22.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It's reemerging

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:24.451 align:middle line:90%
because it's in the epoch.

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:27.621 align:middle line:90%
The new epoch is now before us.

00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:33.560 align:middle line:84%
It's part of this model or
metaphor of out breathing

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.462 align:middle line:90%
and in breathing of the all,

00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:38.865 align:middle line:84%
where everything
starts at a period.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.067 align:middle line:84%
Let's just call it a
period because we're talking

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.736 align:middle line:90%
about a domain of no time.

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:43.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:46.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: So
everything is coherent,

00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:48.108 align:middle line:90%
absolutely everything.

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Okay? Think -- just
imagine that,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:56.116 align:middle line:84%
and things in nature
thermodynamically are only

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:58.752 align:middle line:90%
stable in a state of change.

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:01.087 align:middle line:90%
They're never really static.

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:03.723 align:middle line:84%
They may appear static, but it
means the forces are going back

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.859 align:middle line:84%
and forth so fast you
can't measure them.

00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:07.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:08.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: And
all the subtle domain stuff is

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:08.929 align:middle line:90%
doing that.

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
That's why we can't see it.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Okay, so
the issue to the out breathing,

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.204 align:middle line:84%
there is the beginning
unraveling

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:22.242 align:middle line:84%
from that total coherence
to enough unravelment

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:27.314 align:middle line:84%
to form a society
which -- was called Mu.

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:29.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Yes, for Lemuria.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:30.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Lemuria was second.

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: After Mu.

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:34.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Was
after Mu and then Atlantis was

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
after that, but all of
these were in the domain

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.762 align:middle line:84%
of subtle energies
which travel faster

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:47.534 align:middle line:84%
than electromagnetic light,
so they were invisible,

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:52.405 align:middle line:84%
so the vacuum still looks to
be invisible, but it's filled

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:58.144 align:middle line:84%
with these stuff -- this stuff,
which are hugely energetic

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:01.982 align:middle line:84%
so every step down was
maybe a billion times

00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:04.551 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness
and in coherence.

00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:06.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Each
epoch period of history, yes.

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:08.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: And
then to come to our epoch.

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:09.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:10.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
So we're pretty dumb.

00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:11.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
We're pretty dumb,

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:12.692 align:middle line:84%
but we're starting
to remember again.

00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:14.561 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll take you
back to the SRI,

00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.263 align:middle line:84%
the Stanford Research
Institute question

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:18.732 align:middle line:90%
about Russell Targ and how you.

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:20.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
[Inaudible] often into my office

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:23.436 align:middle line:84%
when I was department
chair and asked

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:26.573 align:middle line:84%
if they could do
these experiments

00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:30.343 align:middle line:84%
that Ingo Swann was thinking
up, and Ingo was a dear friend

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
of mine and I would love to have
been able to do it, but I said,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.582 align:middle line:84%
"Look, the university
won't stand

00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:38.618 align:middle line:90%
for this in the main campus.

00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:41.388 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do this,
I'd suggest you go to talk

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:45.225 align:middle line:84%
to the people at SRI, Stanford
Research International,"

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:51.331 align:middle line:84%
which Stanford owned in
the early days and he did.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:56.236 align:middle line:84%
He [inaudible] the money with
the CIA to start this program,

00:13:56.236 --> 00:14:03.376 align:middle line:84%
and Ingo came to -- periodically
to the area to train people how

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:05.478 align:middle line:90%
to do it in essence, and he --

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:07.714 align:middle line:84%
Ingo found it in
the [inaudible].

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:09.215 align:middle line:90%
It's called far seeing.

00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:10.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.985 align:middle line:84%
It's in most of the
ancient texts,

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:90%
the ability that those had

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.256 align:middle line:84%
and especially temple
workers of the day and such.

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:17.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Yes, absolutely.

00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:19.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And then
they started bringing in others.

00:14:19.793 --> 00:14:22.862 align:middle line:84%
I only came in when
Russell Targ was there.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:26.199 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was a
young pup news anchor,

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.469 align:middle line:84%
and I had talked my news
director into allowing me

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:31.204 align:middle line:90%
to do a story on remote viewing.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
That's good.

00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:33.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Which, you
know, this is 30 years ago.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It's the single most --

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:42.648 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it precise work
in that area that's had

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:44.851 align:middle line:90%
such long time research support

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.187 align:middle line:84%
so that they could do
something really serious.

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:49.222 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Well and I
didn't know it was CIA funded

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.457 align:middle line:90%
or what it was being used for.

00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:51.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Nobody did in the old days.

00:14:51.324 --> 00:14:52.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Nobody --

00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I found that out when I
met Russell Targ maybe 20

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.562 align:middle line:90%
years later.

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:58.164 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting to
me about the experiments,

00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:00.266 align:middle line:84%
I happened to catch them
when they were just coming --

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.501 align:middle line:84%
he had just come
back from Russia.

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:03.003 align:middle line:84%
He was leaving and
going to be coming back

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:05.572 align:middle line:84%
and got the first tape
of that famous experiment

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:09.876 align:middle line:84%
of the remote viewing by Juna,
the woman who is [inaudible],

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:17.117 align:middle line:84%
but the thing to me was the
paradigm changer, was the kicker

00:15:17.117 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the story,
which was the target

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.455 align:middle line:90%
that she viewed was not selected

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:24.491 align:middle line:84%
until three hours
after the viewing.

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:27.293 align:middle line:84%
Now I bring it up because
this brings you into --

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.195 align:middle line:90%
this brings us into your world.

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yep.

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:38.204 align:middle line:84%
Yep. Well and the issue is
when Einstein did his work,

00:15:38.204 --> 00:15:46.012 align:middle line:84%
he had to think of time as an
imaginary distance, so we had X,

00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:52.652 align:middle line:84%
Y, Z, I, the imaginary
number times C, the velocity

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:56.022 align:middle line:84%
of light times T. CT
made it a distance and --

00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:59.592 align:middle line:84%
but it was imaginary in
that frame of reference,

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:03.229 align:middle line:84%
and then his mathematics
worked in this four space.

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:06.166 align:middle line:84%
We find the same kinds of things
in some of our experiments

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:09.102 align:middle line:84%
and we have phenomenas
starting to happen.

00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:15.475 align:middle line:84%
In a remote site up to a month
before we turn the switch

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to supposedly turn
the experiment on.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: The
effects are already happening.

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:21.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: It's
called retro-causality.

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:21.848 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Retro, right.

00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:22.849 align:middle line:90%
Retro-causality.

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yeah.

00:16:24.918 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
phenomena, but there -- it's --

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.022 align:middle line:84%
we've known about information
entanglement over distance...

00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:29.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:30.824 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: ...for
a long time, but not over time.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.895 align:middle line:84%
People have thought that
they're doing a great job

00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
if they can get a
few seconds advance.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.536 align:middle line:84%
I was really shocked when
we first -- in one of our --

00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:45.972 align:middle line:84%
well our Berlin broadcasting
experiment.

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:47.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: We're
going to get into several

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:48.408 align:middle line:90%
of those experiments in a bit.

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:50.343 align:middle line:84%
I just want to lay
the foundation

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:84%
for what domain these
are functioning in.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.449 align:middle line:84%
You call this psycho-energetic
science,

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:58.785 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially
the new physics

00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:00.286 align:middle line:84%
because the old quantum
mechanics.

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:01.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: I think
of it as the new physics.

00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:02.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
You think of it as that

00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:05.692 align:middle line:84%
because the old model
isn't serving us

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.495 align:middle line:84%
when consciousness comes
into play as you say.

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:09.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
In essence since the days

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:13.832 align:middle line:84%
of Descartes, consciousness
has not been allowed

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:19.139 align:middle line:84%
in orthodox science, so what
psycho-energetic science does is

00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:25.177 align:middle line:84%
it adds intention and
consciousness to the set

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:29.449 align:middle line:84%
of experimental variables
wherein you do your research.

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:32.318 align:middle line:84%
You do your research with
these experimental variables,

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:90%
and they're robust.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.556 align:middle line:84%
They can have tremendous
effects.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:41.528 align:middle line:84%
What Descartes said in the 1600s
was because he had the problem

00:17:41.528 --> 00:17:46.599 align:middle line:84%
of coming from a theocratic
society to the logos transformed

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:54.974 align:middle line:84%
to the science society,
he said about a century

00:17:54.974 --> 00:18:00.013 align:middle line:84%
after the transition,
"Let's make the assumption

00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:03.917 align:middle line:84%
that no human qualities of
consciousness, intention,

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:08.154 align:middle line:84%
emotion, mind or spirit can
significantly influence a

00:18:08.154 --> 00:18:11.524 align:middle line:84%
well-designed target
experiment in physical reality."

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:17.764 align:middle line:84%
That allowed him to separate
religion from science,

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
was very necessary at the
time because even a century

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.102 align:middle line:84%
after that transition,
lots and lots

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
of people were still theocrats
and they hadn't made the switch.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:34.948 align:middle line:84%
Two centuries, so mindsets can
be there for a long, long time.

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:38.952 align:middle line:84%
As much as it was a great
assumption at the time,

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:42.655 align:middle line:84%
it's still being unconsciously
held by orthodox science

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:45.024 align:middle line:84%
and orthodox medicine today,
and that's the problem.

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:46.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: It's almost

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:47.493 align:middle line:84%
as though the scientist
has become the priest.

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:48.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: The --

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.463 align:middle line:84%
they are manifesting
the same kind

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:51.865 align:middle line:90%
of hubris that the priests did.

00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:53.633 align:middle line:84%
The priests wouldn't
look at the --

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:58.171 align:middle line:84%
Galileo's experiment because
they knew what the answers were.

00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:00.506 align:middle line:84%
Okay, and of course
they were wrong.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:03.676 align:middle line:84%
The sun does not
travel around the earth.

00:19:03.676 --> 00:19:09.315 align:middle line:84%
It's the other way around, so --
and the hubris in today's world

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:12.051 align:middle line:84%
by the orthodox community,
is that they won't look

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:14.821 align:middle line:84%
at the data, and they
won't let you publish

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
in their journals because,
as I read from many returns,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.630 align:middle line:84%
"I'm sure our readership
isn't interested

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.998 align:middle line:90%
in this category of work."

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith:

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:28.268 align:middle line:84%
So essentially Descartes is
alive and well [chuckles]?

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:29.902 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's changed.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Until
the end of our experiment.

00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:33.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:36.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: So we --
once when I had the opportunity

00:19:36.142 --> 00:19:39.245 align:middle line:84%
from a philanthropist
up in Minnesota to --

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:42.548 align:middle line:84%
he was willing to fund a
three year program with me,

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:47.654 align:middle line:84%
I decided to use the money
to test that experiment,

00:19:47.654 --> 00:19:52.458 align:middle line:84%
his experiment, whether his
hypothesis still worked today.

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:57.263 align:middle line:84%
Never been tested by the
orthodox science community.

00:19:57.263 --> 00:19:59.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Whose hypothesis?

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:00.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Descartes.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Descartes, okay.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:02.902 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:02.902 --> 00:20:04.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
The Descartes experiment,

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:07.307 align:middle line:84%
so I had learned by
that time in my work.

00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I started this psycho-energetic
work back in 1971 as part-time.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.115 align:middle line:84%
I had to give up being
department chair and give

00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:20.119 align:middle line:84%
up my committees in order to
have time to do this on the side

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
because I needed to feed
my family, and I still --

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.426 align:middle line:84%
I very much like
orthodox science,

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:30.296 align:middle line:84%
and I had good Ph.D. students
and -- so that was a good life,

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:32.098 align:middle line:84%
but I -- this other
was a real calling.

00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:37.236 align:middle line:84%
I had to do it, and to
thine own self be true.

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:20:38.338 --> 00:20:39.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
That was the issue.

00:20:39.472 --> 00:20:40.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So
you have three years.

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:41.507 align:middle line:90%
You have some money.

00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:44.043 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: I had
some money, and I decided

00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:45.845 align:middle line:84%
to test the Descartes
experiment.

00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:48.214 align:middle line:84%
By that time, because
I'd been doing this work

00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:52.885 align:middle line:84%
for about 19 years by then, I'd
already published my first book,

00:20:52.885 --> 00:20:55.755 align:middle line:84%
Science and Human
Transformation; Subtle Energies,

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.957 align:middle line:84%
Intentionality and
Consciousness,

00:20:57.957 --> 00:21:05.932 align:middle line:84%
and so I already knew
how to imprint a device,

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:13.639 align:middle line:84%
a simple electrical device with
an intention and so I thought,

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:19.545 align:middle line:84%
"I can do this Descartes
test, and I will use

00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:21.247 align:middle line:90%
that particular device.

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:24.617 align:middle line:84%
I won't use a human because
humans are basically unreliable

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:84%
in the sense is they can't
do the same thing every day

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.791 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, et cetera,
but with a device in between."

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:34.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: That
could hold that intention.

00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:36.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: It
could hold that intention.

00:21:36.162 --> 00:21:39.832 align:middle line:84%
Then I could do it, and other
people could do such things

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:44.103 align:middle line:84%
with those devices, so
it was a perfect place

00:21:44.103 --> 00:21:48.241 align:middle line:84%
for the experiment, so
I with some colleagues,

00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:55.581 align:middle line:84%
people that I asked to join
me, designed four experiments.

00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:58.651 align:middle line:84%
Two were to change
the pH of water.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:03.723 align:middle line:84%
That's the acid alkaline balance
of water up by one pH unit

00:22:03.723 --> 00:22:07.927 align:middle line:84%
and the second one was down
by one pH unit, same water.

00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:13.699 align:middle line:84%
And a pH unit is a lot
for the listening public

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:16.502 align:middle line:84%
because if you take
your own blood

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and if you increase the pH level
of that blood by half a pH unit

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.975 align:middle line:84%
or decrease it by half
a pH unit you're dead.

00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:24.177 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
You'll die, yeah.

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:24.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
You're dead on both ends.

00:22:24.944 --> 00:22:26.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:27.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Or
as we have global warming

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:32.518 align:middle line:84%
and as the -- that happens, the
pH of the ocean water goes up,

00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:36.923 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to lose
coral reefs, and you're going

00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:40.793 align:middle line:84%
to have oysters have too
thin a shell to survive.

00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:42.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: It's
happening even with soils

00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:45.932 align:middle line:84%
with some of the things in the
air creating alkalined soil

00:22:45.932 --> 00:22:47.333 align:middle line:84%
and certain crops
won't grow anymore.

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:48.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Yes, exactly, so it's.

00:22:48.301 --> 00:22:49.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
It's a big deal.

00:22:49.302 --> 00:22:50.369 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It's a big deal.

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
One point is, yeah.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It's a big deal.

00:22:52.338 --> 00:22:53.339 align:middle line:84%
One point is -- it's
a factor of 10

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:55.074 align:middle line:90%
in hydrogen ion concentration.

00:22:55.074 --> 00:22:56.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:59.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: And our
measurement accuracy was 100th

00:22:59.345 --> 00:23:02.081 align:middle line:84%
of a pH unit, so we
had a good instrument.

00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:06.619 align:middle line:84%
We had -- we were able to
do something truly novel,

00:23:06.619 --> 00:23:09.956 align:middle line:84%
and we were remarkably
successful with that

00:23:09.956 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:90%
and the next one was

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
with a liver enzyme,
alkaline phosphatase.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.397 align:middle line:84%
We could condition a space to
this higher level of reality.

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:22.001 align:middle line:84%
We could expose it for
30 minutes in the space,

00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and we'd find its chemical
activity is increased by 30%.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.476 align:middle line:84%
We did it with fruit fly
larva, living system now.

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:35.948 align:middle line:84%
We were able to increase the
ATP, the energy storage molecule

00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:40.987 align:middle line:84%
in the cells of fruit
fly larva by 10 to 15%

00:23:40.987 --> 00:23:45.391 align:middle line:84%
with p-values better than
.001, so one chance in 1000.

00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:46.759 align:middle line:90%
It occurred by random chance.

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.861 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
And because --

00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:51.931 align:middle line:84%
so we were adding a
third phosphorus atom

00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:53.299 align:middle line:90%
to that molecule.

00:23:53.299 --> 00:23:56.903 align:middle line:84%
The precursor ADP was
-- had two phosphorus,

00:23:56.903 --> 00:24:00.506 align:middle line:84%
so that was the beginning
state and so we were able

00:24:00.506 --> 00:24:03.142 align:middle line:90%
to increase very significantly

00:24:03.142 --> 00:24:05.645 align:middle line:84%
and that made the
fruit flies more fit,

00:24:05.645 --> 00:24:11.083 align:middle line:84%
so it took much less time to
get to the adult fly stage.

00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:12.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: I remember.

00:24:12.118 --> 00:24:13.953 align:middle line:84%
It's 25% less time
to reach adulthood.

00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:14.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
25%, yeah.

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:16.389 align:middle line:84%
Again with p-values
better than .001.

00:24:16.389 --> 00:24:19.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So by this
time you guys are going sayonara

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.459 align:middle line:90%
Descartes [chuckles].

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:21.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Yes, exactly.

00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:23.229 align:middle line:90%
It was sayonara.

00:24:23.229 --> 00:24:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: But who

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.801 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific community
embraced your experiments?

00:24:31.037 --> 00:24:31.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Nada.

00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:32.305 align:middle line:90%
Very few.

00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:33.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Nada.

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yeah.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.342 align:middle line:84%
Basically the issue is
I certainly had a couple

00:24:36.342 --> 00:24:41.881 align:middle line:84%
of friends at Stanford that were
still my friends after I gave

00:24:41.881 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:84%
up being department chair to
do this crazy kind of stuff.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.253 align:middle line:84%
They did try to --
what's it called

00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:49.288 align:middle line:84%
when you do something
with someone?

00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:50.456 align:middle line:90%
An intervention [chuckles].

00:24:50.456 --> 00:24:52.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
[Chuckles] To get you off

00:24:52.558 --> 00:24:55.127 align:middle line:84%
of this ridiculous
path you were on.

00:24:55.127 --> 00:24:55.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Right.

00:24:55.528 --> 00:24:56.796 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:56.796 --> 00:24:57.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So you
must've been about jumping

00:24:57.997 --> 00:25:00.566 align:middle line:84%
out of your skin when you
saw the results of this.

00:25:00.566 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Oh yes.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.535 align:middle line:90%
I was just glorious.

00:25:02.535 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: The
mind, the intention's effect

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:84%
on changing the material
world, which is --

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.342 align:middle line:90%
this is remote healing.

00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:11.143 align:middle line:90%
This is faith healing.

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:11.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
This is -- exactly.

00:25:11.911 --> 00:25:12.979 align:middle line:90%
It's all of those things.

00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:15.681 align:middle line:84%
It provides the structure
for those folks,

00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:18.017 align:middle line:84%
and one of the reasons
why they love my work

00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:20.987 align:middle line:84%
so much is it gives them a
skeleton to hang their work on.

00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:22.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Yes, absolutely.

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:23.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: And
their work is meaningful,

00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:26.892 align:middle line:84%
but they have not been able
to get any reliable data.

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say reliable,
but reproducible data

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.235 align:middle line:84%
with all the scientific
caveats, and it's hard

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:37.903 align:middle line:90%
when you're dealing with humans.

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:39.105 align:middle line:90%
They're so -- humans have

00:25:39.105 --> 00:25:41.607 align:middle line:84%
so many variables in
them that -- yeah.

00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:42.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:44.844 align:middle line:84%
The good thing is you did
provide that framework for them.

00:25:44.844 --> 00:25:46.178 align:middle line:90%
You gave it a language.

00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:49.415 align:middle line:84%
You gave it a model, and you
say it's not just the mind.

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:50.716 align:middle line:90%
And this is where I want to get

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:53.386 align:middle line:84%
into an analogy you gave me
off camera, which I loved.

00:25:53.386 --> 00:25:55.121 align:middle line:90%
It also requires the emotion,

00:25:55.121 --> 00:25:59.191 align:middle line:84%
and you liken the mind
to the rocket and...

00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:02.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: And
the emotion is the power,

00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:03.829 align:middle line:90%
the thruster.

00:26:03.829 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes,

00:26:05.865 --> 00:26:07.933 align:middle line:84%
so that's what gives it
the thrust, so the emotion.

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:12.171 align:middle line:84%
When you do imprint an
intention, it's really important

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:18.044 align:middle line:84%
to have your emotion get
deeply into the commitment

00:26:18.044 --> 00:26:20.079 align:middle line:90%
like that young boy, Jacob.

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:21.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: We're
going to see him in just a sec.

00:26:21.514 --> 00:26:22.748 align:middle line:90%
Oh I can't wait to show this.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Because basically that's it.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.118 align:middle line:90%
He's emotionally caught

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:28.654 align:middle line:84%
up in what he's doing,
and he should be.

00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:29.622 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
We'll see that.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.391 align:middle line:84%
We're going to show about
a two minute clip of him.

00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:35.594 align:middle line:84%
We talked with Suzy also,
and we showed a clip of him

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:36.862 align:middle line:90%
when he was very young

00:26:36.862 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and he was basically diagramming
how time travel works,

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.402 align:middle line:84%
and he was maybe
eight at the time.

00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:46.372 align:middle line:84%
He was very sure of himself, and
his diagrams were certainly --

00:26:46.372 --> 00:26:48.274 align:middle line:84%
there isn't any science
out there any more accurate

00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:53.612 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen of wormholes and
time space fabrication than his.

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.349 align:middle line:84%
And so the one we're going to
see a little bit later he's

00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:59.485 align:middle line:84%
about 14-years-old talking
at TED talks and it is

00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:01.387 align:middle line:90%
that enthusiasm coming through.

00:27:01.387 --> 00:27:03.723 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
that works without getting

00:27:03.723 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:84%
into the scientific terms so
much about setting the intention

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and then having to use that
booster fuel of the emotions

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.499 align:middle line:84%
to create the effect
on the material world.

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:15.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
First of all, the key thing

00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:21.407 align:middle line:84%
in my modeling is that
it was necessary for me

00:27:21.407 --> 00:27:26.512 align:middle line:84%
to invent a duplex frame of
reference for studying nature.

00:27:26.512 --> 00:27:31.917 align:middle line:84%
The -- our normal reality
is just a simplex system,

00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:33.052 align:middle line:90%
distance, time.

00:27:33.052 --> 00:27:36.589 align:middle line:84%
It's a four dimensional
construct, okay?

00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:42.862 align:middle line:84%
So to explain the phenomena that
I was getting, I said, "Okay.

00:27:42.862 --> 00:27:45.831 align:middle line:84%
I've got to expand the reference
frame," and the key part

00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:48.934 align:middle line:84%
of expanding the reference
frame was that I had

00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:53.005 align:middle line:84%
to invent something that
existed in my intuition

00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:54.807 align:middle line:90%
in the domain of emotion.

00:27:54.807 --> 00:27:56.575 align:middle line:90%
I called it a deltron.

00:27:56.575 --> 00:27:59.178 align:middle line:84%
A deltron can go both
faster than light

00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:00.513 align:middle line:90%
and slower than light.

00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:03.115 align:middle line:84%
It's outside of distance
time, okay?

00:28:03.115 --> 00:28:06.152 align:middle line:84%
One of the things you may
not know, but it turns

00:28:06.152 --> 00:28:09.822 align:middle line:84%
out relativity theory
works very fine in faster

00:28:09.822 --> 00:28:12.925 align:middle line:84%
than light phenomena, and it
works very -- well, of course,

00:28:12.925 --> 00:28:16.962 align:middle line:84%
in slower than light, but
the Einstein facts are saying

00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:84%
that -- because he thought
only in terms of distance time

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.671 align:middle line:84%
and nothing beyond it, so as you
accelerate a particle it goes

00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:29.141 align:middle line:84%
up towards infinity at
the velocity of light.

00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:31.911 align:middle line:84%
And he says you'd have to give
it an infinite amount of energy

00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:34.814 align:middle line:84%
to get the velocity of light
and therefore it can't happen,

00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:36.749 align:middle line:84%
so nothing can go
faster than light,

00:28:36.749 --> 00:28:44.356 align:middle line:84%
but when you use a duplex frame,
which I did, which is the slower

00:28:44.356 --> 00:28:46.625 align:middle line:84%
than light stuff is
distance time, but the faster

00:28:46.625 --> 00:28:49.228 align:middle line:84%
than light is its
reciprocal, okay?

00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:50.663 align:middle line:84%
That's a frequency
domain because.

00:28:50.663 --> 00:28:52.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And that's
where the emotions live?

00:28:52.698 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: No,
they're in the next stage up.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Okay, the -- okay.

00:28:56.602 --> 00:28:58.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
So the point is

00:28:58.304 --> 00:29:03.809 align:middle line:84%
that now there is another domain
beyond the velocity of light,

00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:06.278 align:middle line:84%
so now you don't have to go
all the way up to infinity.

00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:09.014 align:middle line:84%
You can go part way up and
you just tunnel right through,

00:29:09.014 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:84%
which quantum mechanics
says you can do,

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.386 align:middle line:84%
and going the other way you
can tunnel right through,

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:17.957 align:middle line:84%
so in essence, that
limitation no longer holds

00:29:17.957 --> 00:29:22.328 align:middle line:84%
when you're using this kind of
duplex frame to look at nature.

00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:23.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Well
now this is interesting.

00:29:23.863 --> 00:29:24.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: And then

00:29:24.797 --> 00:29:27.266 align:middle line:84%
that duplex frame
is embedded now

00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:30.703 align:middle line:84%
in the higher dimensional
frames where emotion is

00:29:30.703 --> 00:29:32.805 align:middle line:90%
and mind is and spirit is.

00:29:32.805 --> 00:29:35.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So a couple
weeks ago I was interviewing

00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:36.508 align:middle line:90%
Barbara Hand Clow.

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:38.143 align:middle line:90%
She's a scientist, but she --

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:40.946 align:middle line:84%
anyone who has watched
the interview already,

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:43.983 align:middle line:84%
basically she started
coming in communication

00:29:43.983 --> 00:29:46.619 align:middle line:84%
with [inaudible] culture,
[inaudible] specifically,

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:49.622 align:middle line:84%
who took a period of about
60 hours to download her

00:29:49.622 --> 00:29:52.358 align:middle line:84%
with the nature of our
multidimensionality,

00:29:52.358 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:84%
the nine dimensions that
they said we live in.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.497 align:middle line:84%
But the point there is, they
said the only access point

00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:02.034 align:middle line:84%
to the higher dimensions
was through feeling.

00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:07.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: When
I do -- when we imprint,

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:14.179 align:middle line:84%
and we become coherent in this
plane but we try to cohere

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:19.051 align:middle line:84%
with colleagues in higher
dimensions and you know

00:30:19.051 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:84%
when you're there
when you feel it.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
That's right.

00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what they were saying.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.557 align:middle line:90%
It is a feeling first.

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.993 align:middle line:84%
Now some people can see
into those realms and hear

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:29.261 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and interact.

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:30.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: I
can't do any of those things.

00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:32.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And some
people can, but we can all feel.

00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:33.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
But I can feel.

00:30:33.465 --> 00:30:34.266 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:34.266 --> 00:30:35.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: And so.

00:30:35.267 --> 00:30:36.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Feeling is key.

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:39.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And you
have a saying that I just love.

00:30:39.138 --> 00:30:40.706 align:middle line:90%
Well, it has to do with love,

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:43.943 align:middle line:84%
and that love is the
universal solvent,

00:30:43.943 --> 00:30:48.447 align:middle line:84%
so now as this component of
emotion or feeling that seems

00:30:48.447 --> 00:30:53.619 align:middle line:84%
to have this bonding effect in
these other frequency ranges

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:56.555 align:middle line:84%
or dimensions you're talking
about, such as when --

00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:59.091 align:middle line:84%
if you're close to
someone they think of you

00:30:59.091 --> 00:31:01.026 align:middle line:84%
and you know it immediately,
right?

00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:02.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: It's
a precursor to telepathy.

00:31:02.795 --> 00:31:05.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Exactly, and
we've all had those experiences,

00:31:05.331 --> 00:31:08.033 align:middle line:84%
so that's the area
you're working

00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:10.903 align:middle line:84%
in that you say gives
us the velocity

00:31:10.903 --> 00:31:12.571 align:middle line:90%
for the mental intention.

00:31:12.571 --> 00:31:13.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It gives the thrust.

00:31:13.806 --> 00:31:15.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
The thrust, yeah.

00:31:15.107 --> 00:31:15.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yeah
thrust is the better word.

00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:16.375 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: The thrust

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:21.714 align:middle line:84%
for what it is our mind has
constructed as an intention.

00:31:21.714 --> 00:31:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
And the issue is, you see,

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.952 align:middle line:84%
I started this by
explaining the deltron.

00:31:26.952 --> 00:31:28.053 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:28.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
That's the coupler.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.289 align:middle line:90%
The coupler's really important.

00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:84%
You can have these two domains
functioning, but not interacting

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.162 align:middle line:84%
with each other because if
one is faster than light

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:38.497 align:middle line:84%
and the other's slower
than light,

00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:39.631 align:middle line:90%
they would repel each other.

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:43.168 align:middle line:84%
They will not interact,
so the issue is you have

00:31:43.168 --> 00:31:46.038 align:middle line:90%
to have a coupler, so.

00:31:46.038 --> 00:31:48.007 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: What would
the coupler be in a situation

00:31:48.007 --> 00:31:50.843 align:middle line:84%
where another human being
whom you're connected

00:31:50.843 --> 00:31:54.013 align:middle line:84%
with is thinking of you
and you receive that?

00:31:54.013 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
That's part of it,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.051 align:middle line:84%
and the coupler is even
important is making atoms cohere

00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:00.619 align:middle line:90%
within the particles, et cetera.

00:32:00.619 --> 00:32:01.687 align:middle line:90%
It can get complicated.

00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:02.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: It gets --

00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:03.956 align:middle line:84%
yeah we won't get into
the science of it, okay.

00:32:03.956 --> 00:32:05.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
But the coupler is key

00:32:05.824 --> 00:32:12.731 align:middle line:84%
in this whole drama, and
the more coupling you have,

00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:16.135 align:middle line:84%
the more everything is
connected to everything else,

00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:20.305 align:middle line:84%
so it's a connector and that's
happening in our universe.

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:25.177 align:middle line:84%
This is why the placebo
effect is nonzero.

00:32:26.211 --> 00:32:27.646 align:middle line:90%
Understand why?

00:32:27.646 --> 00:32:28.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: No.

00:32:28.447 --> 00:32:29.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Okay.

00:32:29.448 --> 00:32:31.784 align:middle line:84%
I said do you want
to understand why?

00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:32.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Oh, yes I do.

00:32:32.551 --> 00:32:33.819 align:middle line:90%
I said I don't understand.

00:32:33.819 --> 00:32:35.154 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'd love to know.

00:32:35.154 --> 00:32:36.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: All
right, because it's important.

00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.126 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
There was an article I read

00:32:41.126 --> 00:32:47.332 align:middle line:84%
in Science Magazine
back in about 1998,

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:52.004 align:middle line:84%
and I refer to it
in my writings.

00:32:53.405 --> 00:33:00.479 align:middle line:84%
Twenty five years before, the
placebo effect was maybe 15%,

00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:05.651 align:middle line:84%
but that year they had
done another OCD experiment

00:33:05.651 --> 00:33:09.721 align:middle line:84%
and they found that
placebo effect was 75,

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:14.526 align:middle line:84%
80% and was getting
to the place that more

00:33:14.526 --> 00:33:20.299 align:middle line:84%
and more pharmaceuticals were
being denied because they --

00:33:20.299 --> 00:33:22.534 align:middle line:90%
the placebo effect was so high.

00:33:22.534 --> 00:33:24.103 align:middle line:90%
That meant it didn't work.

00:33:24.103 --> 00:33:28.273 align:middle line:84%
They interpreted that it didn't
work, but the way I looked

00:33:28.273 --> 00:33:36.381 align:middle line:84%
at it was that in the cosmos
itself this coupler, deltrons,

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:42.688 align:middle line:84%
have been leaking into
distance time very slowly.

00:33:42.688 --> 00:33:43.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Interesting.

00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:44.523 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: So
that now you can have coupling

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:53.632 align:middle line:84%
between things, and so
you can't look at it.

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:56.034 align:middle line:84%
When you have this kind of
coupling you have to look

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:59.104 align:middle line:84%
at these things not as
a mathematical scalar,

00:33:59.104 --> 00:34:03.208 align:middle line:84%
which is just sort of one data
point at a point, but you have

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:84%
to look at them as vectors, and
when you look at them as vectors

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.548 align:middle line:84%
in the medical experiment,
you've a doctor.

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:11.984 align:middle line:90%
You have a treatment.

00:34:11.984 --> 00:34:14.720 align:middle line:84%
You have patients, and
you have a placebo.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.524 align:middle line:84%
Each of them must be
treated as a vector,

00:34:18.524 --> 00:34:22.461 align:middle line:84%
and the system is a
sum of the vectors,

00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:26.265 align:middle line:84%
but what you can experimentally
measure is what's called

00:34:26.265 --> 00:34:27.766 align:middle line:90%
the intensity.

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:32.004 align:middle line:84%
The intensity means that you
have to take that system vector

00:34:32.004 --> 00:34:34.807 align:middle line:84%
and you multiply it with what's
called the complex conjugant.

00:34:34.807 --> 00:34:37.008 align:middle line:84%
It just means you've
changed the sign

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:38.577 align:middle line:90%
of the imaginary parts, okay?

00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:40.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
But now what it means,

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.651 align:middle line:84%
it's like taking A
plus B plus C plus D,

00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:50.856 align:middle line:84%
multiplying A prime plus B prime
plus C prime plus D prime, okay?

00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:53.025 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going
to get A A primes.

00:34:53.025 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get A B
primes, A C primes, A D primes,

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.166 align:middle line:84%
so it means that the placebo,
which is one of those,

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:04.536 align:middle line:84%
is multiplied by all these
other elements in the system.

00:35:04.536 --> 00:35:05.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Interesting.

00:35:05.537 --> 00:35:07.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
And therefore,

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:09.942 align:middle line:84%
although it is inert
all by itself,

00:35:09.942 --> 00:35:12.878 align:middle line:90%
in the system it is not inert.

00:35:12.878 --> 00:35:14.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Interesting.

00:35:14.546 --> 00:35:15.881 align:middle line:90%
Okay, now where does?

00:35:15.881 --> 00:35:17.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Anyway,
you don't want to go there

00:35:17.049 --> 00:35:18.083 align:middle line:90%
because that's complex.

00:35:18.083 --> 00:35:19.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Where does this --

00:35:19.084 --> 00:35:20.118 align:middle line:84%
no I don't want to
go further into it

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:21.486 align:middle line:84%
because I wouldn't
even understand you,

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:84%
so where does this universal
solvent that you speak of as --

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:31.830 align:middle line:84%
of love figure in this
coupling or this deltron?

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:34.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: I think
where it seems to come in --

00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I think if I go back to one
of the experiences I had

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.305 align:middle line:90%
when I was consulting with --

00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:43.475 align:middle line:84%
at DuPont with a man who
had a difficult problem

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:46.411 align:middle line:84%
in an area I was not
at all expert in,

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:52.885 align:middle line:84%
but I found that by
nourishing, radiating --

00:35:52.885 --> 00:35:54.586 align:middle line:90%
just say radiating love to him.

00:35:54.586 --> 00:35:55.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:35:55.821 --> 00:36:03.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Caring, consideration, we --

00:36:03.729 --> 00:36:11.236 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness is -- seemed
to join, so in essence I seemed

00:36:11.236 --> 00:36:16.341 align:middle line:84%
to have access to his
information banks,

00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:20.212 align:middle line:84%
and so I could have a meaningful
conversation with him on things

00:36:20.212 --> 00:36:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that he was -- knew a lot about,
and I found out about only

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.954 align:middle line:84%
because I was closely
joined with him.

00:36:28.954 --> 00:36:29.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
You were joined.

00:36:29.454 --> 00:36:30.789 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:32.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: We were
part of a one, and then --

00:36:32.991 --> 00:36:35.994 align:middle line:84%
and so that's really
where love is.

00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:37.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: That makes
sense because a lot of people

00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:40.766 align:middle line:84%
that are capable of seeing
beyond time space continuum

00:36:40.766 --> 00:36:43.802 align:middle line:84%
also, speak about the
accompanying feeling

00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:45.938 align:middle line:84%
that happens before
they start the reading

00:36:45.938 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:84%
of this incredible
sense of love, peace.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It's the feeling, exactly.

00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:53.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Now some
people talk a lot about this,

00:36:53.645 --> 00:36:56.782 align:middle line:84%
this field of -- now I know
we're switching gears just a

00:36:56.782 --> 00:37:00.185 align:middle line:84%
little bit, but you don't
like that term the field.

00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:03.188 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: The
field -- there are many fields.

00:37:03.188 --> 00:37:06.425 align:middle line:84%
Okay, we have in our
orthodox science community.

00:37:06.425 --> 00:37:10.595 align:middle line:84%
We know four fundamental forces,
gravity, electromagnetism,

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:13.765 align:middle line:84%
short range nuclear force,
long range nuclear force,

00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:17.302 align:middle line:84%
and they create many
fields, okay?

00:37:17.302 --> 00:37:21.573 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the things
that go faster than light.

00:37:21.573 --> 00:37:23.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So
we need a new language.

00:37:23.442 --> 00:37:24.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
We need a new language,

00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:25.978 align:middle line:84%
and the point is
there are fields.

00:37:25.978 --> 00:37:28.013 align:middle line:84%
I call them subtle
energy fields.

00:37:28.013 --> 00:37:30.882 align:middle line:84%
A subtle energy is
anything outside

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:35.020 align:middle line:84%
of the four fundamental
forces, so that whole territory.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.524 align:middle line:84%
Nature is radiating to us all
the time on many, many bands,

00:37:39.524 --> 00:37:42.494 align:middle line:84%
and we know one of them, so
I like to think of a ladder

00:37:42.494 --> 00:37:44.296 align:middle line:90%
of understanding, okay?

00:37:44.296 --> 00:37:48.233 align:middle line:84%
And the rungs are these
levels of reality.

00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:51.536 align:middle line:84%
The bottom most rung
we have done very well.

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:54.306 align:middle line:84%
That's the rung of
today's orthodox science.

00:37:54.306 --> 00:37:55.841 align:middle line:90%
We've done it for 400 years.

00:37:55.841 --> 00:37:57.275 align:middle line:90%
We do it very well.

00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.845 align:middle line:90%
We now know that.

00:37:59.845 --> 00:38:02.981 align:middle line:84%
What my work is doing, it's
dealing with the second rung

00:38:02.981 --> 00:38:07.018 align:middle line:84%
with some things from the
third rung, and that's our path

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:10.188 align:middle line:84%
as we go into this next
epoch and the epoch after it,

00:38:10.188 --> 00:38:12.758 align:middle line:84%
and the epoch after that
as we get back to the one.

00:38:12.758 --> 00:38:13.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
So that takes us now

00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:16.228 align:middle line:84%
to these new kids --
these kids being born

00:38:16.228 --> 00:38:20.665 align:middle line:84%
that are being diagnosed
by an old paradigm

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:23.301 align:middle line:90%
of medicine as autistic.

00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:29.074 align:middle line:84%
And so Suzy told me that
when she first met with you,

00:38:29.074 --> 00:38:30.642 align:middle line:84%
you said, "You know,
I'm interested

00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:32.878 align:middle line:84%
in doing something
with these kids."

00:38:32.878 --> 00:38:33.745 align:middle line:90%
Why was that?

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:35.280 align:middle line:90%
What were you seeing?

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Well basically we met

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:42.721 align:middle line:84%
about two years ago in a group
of people I hadn't met before,

00:38:42.721 --> 00:38:46.258 align:middle line:84%
and they asked me to talk about
just what you're asking me

00:38:46.258 --> 00:38:50.996 align:middle line:84%
to talk about and Suzy was
quiet and then she started

00:38:50.996 --> 00:38:56.601 align:middle line:84%
to ask something, and I
was saying things to her

00:38:56.601 --> 00:39:00.038 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "Oh, that's just
what I was thinking to ask you,"

00:39:00.038 --> 00:39:05.177 align:middle line:84%
and this went back and forth
a few times and I thought,

00:39:06.411 --> 00:39:09.247 align:middle line:84%
"She's a very interesting,"
aside from being pretty,

00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:11.683 align:middle line:84%
"She's a very interesting
woman," and I thought

00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:16.254 align:middle line:84%
at that time, "Hmm, I
must get back to her,

00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:84%
learn more about
what she's doing."

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:22.327 align:middle line:84%
That's how we met, and then
we had a second occasion.

00:39:22.327 --> 00:39:23.929 align:middle line:84%
They were -- we were
brought together

00:39:23.929 --> 00:39:25.564 align:middle line:84%
by Sandie Sedgbeer,
whom you know.

00:39:25.564 --> 00:39:26.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes, I do.

00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:29.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: And the
second one as well, over a lunch

00:39:29.468 --> 00:39:35.273 align:middle line:84%
with Suzy -- my wife Jean and I
and Suzy and Bill from England

00:39:35.273 --> 00:39:37.476 align:middle line:84%
that she works with --
forget his last name --

00:39:37.476 --> 00:39:41.246 align:middle line:90%
sorry, and that's where the --

00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:43.748 align:middle line:84%
I learned about the work
that they were doing together

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:47.853 align:middle line:84%
with respect to autistic
children and such, and I said,

00:39:47.853 --> 00:39:51.123 align:middle line:84%
"I think it would be interesting
to imprint an intention

00:39:51.123 --> 00:39:54.459 align:middle line:84%
and to do something
in this area,"

00:39:54.459 --> 00:39:56.394 align:middle line:90%
and that's where it began.

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:58.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Which is -- I mean --

00:39:58.063 --> 00:40:01.500 align:middle line:84%
what you're seeing is -- I know
you're both feeling very joyful

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.702 align:middle line:84%
at the early evidence of
what is coming in over this.

00:40:03.702 --> 00:40:04.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Remarkably joyful.

00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:06.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
So with these kids --

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:10.709 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting these signals to
these kids and their families

00:40:10.709 --> 00:40:11.943 align:middle line:90%
through your technology.

00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:12.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
And the signals you have

00:40:12.944 --> 00:40:14.579 align:middle line:84%
to understand -- I
think I mentioned

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:18.984 align:middle line:90%
to you the other night --

00:40:18.984 --> 00:40:21.953 align:middle line:84%
the first imprinting
experiment we did on --

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:24.155 align:middle line:84%
to make an intention
host device,

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:27.192 align:middle line:84%
to make the device
be an active system.

00:40:27.192 --> 00:40:30.095 align:middle line:90%
The intention was in it --

00:40:30.095 --> 00:40:33.665 align:middle line:84%
took that device and took
an un-imprinted host device,

00:40:33.665 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:84%
okay -- which can be made
commercially, so it's available

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.606 align:middle line:84%
and set them about
100 meters apart

00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:44.075 align:middle line:84%
and turned them off
electrically so there should --

00:40:44.075 --> 00:40:45.410 align:middle line:90%
they should just sit there.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.312 align:middle line:90%
Nothing should happen, right?

00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:52.083 align:middle line:84%
Not so. Within three days
this un-imprinted one --

00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:57.289 align:middle line:84%
that's that one, received the
imprint statement from this one,

00:40:57.289 --> 00:41:00.825 align:middle line:84%
so that that could be used
the same way as this one.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:06.998 align:middle line:84%
I first said, "Holy whatever,"
and I'm not going to be able

00:41:06.998 --> 00:41:10.569 align:middle line:84%
to do an experiment
because I lose my controls.

00:41:10.569 --> 00:41:12.504 align:middle line:90%
There's no control, and...

00:41:12.504 --> 00:41:13.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Because
these guys are talking

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:14.739 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:15.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
...they're talking to each other

00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:18.443 align:middle line:84%
in a language I have
no knowledge of

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:21.713 align:middle line:84%
and no one else does, and then
I thought about it a little bit,

00:41:21.713 --> 00:41:23.248 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, "Well, okay.

00:41:23.248 --> 00:41:27.319 align:middle line:90%
They -- they're interacting.

00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:29.554 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetism is
probably involved,

00:41:29.554 --> 00:41:34.259 align:middle line:84%
but normal surround
air electromagnetism,

00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:90%
so I can screen them.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.728 align:middle line:90%
I can put them

00:41:36.728 --> 00:41:40.198 align:middle line:84%
in an electrically
grounded Faraday cage, or --

00:41:40.198 --> 00:41:43.034 align:middle line:84%
and to take care of these
light kind of things,

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:45.103 align:middle line:84%
I can wrap them in
aluminum foil."

00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:47.539 align:middle line:84%
So when I did that I
found that I could keep

00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:50.976 align:middle line:84%
that imprint intention alive
for three to six months,

00:41:50.976 --> 00:41:52.944 align:middle line:84%
which meant I could
do experiments.

00:41:52.944 --> 00:41:54.246 align:middle line:84%
I could send them
to other people.

00:41:54.246 --> 00:41:56.948 align:middle line:84%
They could do experiments,
and we could re-imprint them

00:41:56.948 --> 00:42:01.386 align:middle line:84%
on that kind of a cycle, so
that meant it was possible

00:42:01.386 --> 00:42:03.888 align:middle line:84%
to do the experiments
and that lead to the ones

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:04.956 align:middle line:84%
that we already talked
to you about,

00:42:04.956 --> 00:42:07.225 align:middle line:84%
the changing the
properties of materials,

00:42:07.225 --> 00:42:11.396 align:middle line:84%
and then the next
serious step with that was

00:42:11.396 --> 00:42:14.866 align:middle line:90%
to try to broadcast this.

00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:17.869 align:middle line:84%
And the first experiment
was depression anxiety,

00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:23.341 align:middle line:84%
which we broadcast
over maybe 1500 --

00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:29.614 align:middle line:84%
2000 miles, and found
when the experiment ran

00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:34.753 align:middle line:84%
for eight months we got
p-values better than .001.

00:42:34.753 --> 00:42:37.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Explain
in real numbers what kind

00:42:37.122 --> 00:42:38.757 align:middle line:90%
of effects that means.

00:42:38.757 --> 00:42:40.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Okay,
what it means is -- we first --

00:42:40.992 --> 00:42:45.730 align:middle line:84%
we had about 500
people and a student

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:50.068 align:middle line:84%
at Holos University wanted to do
a thesis using this technology.

00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:56.541 align:middle line:84%
So the technique we worked
out was to use just the name

00:42:56.541 --> 00:43:02.113 align:middle line:84%
and address, okay, of
the individual scrolling

00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:07.786 align:middle line:84%
through a laptop
computer in a room

00:43:07.786 --> 00:43:11.956 align:middle line:84%
where we could have an
imprinted host device

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:16.161 align:middle line:84%
to condition the space with
a particular intention,

00:43:16.161 --> 00:43:18.797 align:middle line:84%
with the assumption
that the intention --

00:43:18.797 --> 00:43:23.334 align:middle line:84%
the space would saturate
the computer

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:26.071 align:middle line:84%
because you see the
act is an intention

00:43:26.071 --> 00:43:31.609 align:middle line:84%
that in fact Person A gets a
piece of time of the broadcast,

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:33.211 align:middle line:90%
Person B, Person C, et cetera.

00:43:33.211 --> 00:43:33.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:35.246 align:middle line:90%
It's a cycle [inaudible].

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:36.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: So
it's all implicit in that,

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:40.351 align:middle line:90%
and then we had another site

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:44.222 align:middle line:84%
where we had an un-imprinted
device or no --

00:43:44.222 --> 00:43:48.893 align:middle line:84%
we didn't condition the space
at all, but we did this rotation

00:43:48.893 --> 00:43:54.199 align:middle line:84%
of the laptop computer with
the same -- no effect there.

00:43:54.199 --> 00:43:58.336 align:middle line:84%
In this one we -- at three
months we got a beginning

00:43:58.336 --> 00:44:01.005 align:middle line:84%
effect, but it wasn't
really significant

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:03.408 align:middle line:84%
but at eight months
it was significant,

00:44:03.408 --> 00:44:06.911 align:middle line:84%
which means that there was
only one chance in 1000

00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:08.847 align:middle line:84%
that it could've
happened by random chance.

00:44:08.847 --> 00:44:10.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So
people were getting?

00:44:10.115 --> 00:44:11.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
People were getting better.

00:44:11.216 --> 00:44:12.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Very noticeable results

00:44:12.751 --> 00:44:14.152 align:middle line:90%
on their depression and anxiety.

00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:15.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
There were -- yes --

00:44:15.086 --> 00:44:16.354 align:middle line:84%
exactly, very significant
results.

00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:17.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay,
so that was the first one.

00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: That
was the first experiment,

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:22.794 align:middle line:84%
and then I did it -- we
did another one where --

00:44:22.794 --> 00:44:26.931 align:middle line:84%
and that was about
three years ago --

00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:32.570 align:middle line:84%
four years ago I guess between
our Payson, Arizona lab site

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and a particular room
in a particular building

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.980 align:middle line:84%
on a particular corner
in Berlin, Germany.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.747 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:44:42.747 --> 00:44:44.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:47.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: And
we knew the postal address,

00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:49.754 align:middle line:90%
so that was our target site.

00:44:49.754 --> 00:44:54.225 align:middle line:90%
And the intention was to --

00:44:54.225 --> 00:44:58.563 align:middle line:84%
in our site we set up exactly
the same kind of equipment

00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:01.499 align:middle line:84%
in both places with
an un-imprinted device

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:04.269 align:middle line:90%
and intention site.

00:45:04.269 --> 00:45:10.909 align:middle line:84%
We were going to imprint
the one in the Payson site

00:45:10.909 --> 00:45:16.181 align:middle line:84%
so that the pH would go up
by one and a half pH units,

00:45:16.181 --> 00:45:20.952 align:middle line:84%
and immediately be
broadcast to Berlin, Germany,

00:45:20.952 --> 00:45:24.022 align:middle line:84%
that particular site and
that theirs should go up

00:45:24.022 --> 00:45:26.357 align:middle line:84%
and they should see the
measurement and they can plot

00:45:26.357 --> 00:45:29.494 align:middle line:84%
out their data and
we can plot our data.

00:45:29.494 --> 00:45:31.196 align:middle line:90%
It happened.

00:45:31.196 --> 00:45:35.767 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing that was
surprising was there's started

00:45:35.767 --> 00:45:37.635 align:middle line:90%
going up even before.

00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: [Chuckles].

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: I
wrote the imprint statement.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.338 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:45:40.338 --> 00:45:41.039 align:middle line:84%
I told them what
it was going to be.

00:45:41.039 --> 00:45:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: It's

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.708 align:middle line:84%
like that advanced remote
viewing into the future.

00:45:43.708 --> 00:45:44.709 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:46.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Exactly, so --

00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:48.546 align:middle line:84%
and this was a month before I
threw the switch eventually.

00:45:48.546 --> 00:45:49.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Wow, a month.

00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:50.215 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:45:50.215 --> 00:45:51.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Yes, it is.

00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Just by
the time you've even conceived

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:53.551 align:middle line:84%
of the experiment,
it's already underway.

00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:54.719 align:middle line:90%
It's already happening.

00:45:54.719 --> 00:45:56.588 align:middle line:84%
That tells us a lot
about what's happening

00:45:56.588 --> 00:45:59.891 align:middle line:84%
with our random musings
of the mind day in

00:45:59.891 --> 00:46:00.725 align:middle line:90%
and day out, doesn't it?

00:46:00.725 --> 00:46:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Exactly.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.097 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well it -- the mind thing
of course is very important.

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:07.232 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should put it in.

00:46:07.232 --> 00:46:08.766 align:middle line:90%
I talked a bit about it before,

00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:11.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's important
for your listeners.

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:19.544 align:middle line:84%
The -- we have our physical
mind and we have our --

00:46:19.544 --> 00:46:21.012 align:middle line:90%
let's say our conscious mind,

00:46:21.012 --> 00:46:23.381 align:middle line:84%
and we have our unconscious
mind.

00:46:23.381 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:84%
The information handling
capacity

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:29.187 align:middle line:84%
of the conscious mind
appears to be less

00:46:29.187 --> 00:46:34.792 align:middle line:84%
than 50 bits per second whereas
the unconscious mind is probably

00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:39.497 align:middle line:84%
more than 50 million bits per
second, so you can get from this

00:46:39.497 --> 00:46:42.767 align:middle line:84%
that the unconscious mind is
doing almost all the work.

00:46:42.767 --> 00:46:43.902 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
It's running the show.

00:46:43.902 --> 00:46:44.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It's running the show.

00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:90%
It's gathering the data.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.138 align:middle line:90%
It's plotting the data.

00:46:47.138 --> 00:46:48.273 align:middle line:90%
It's operating.

00:46:48.273 --> 00:46:50.341 align:middle line:84%
It's using differential
equations on the data.

00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:51.976 align:middle line:84%
It's getting all
kinds of things,

00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:54.712 align:middle line:84%
and it takes little
kernels, gathers

00:46:54.712 --> 00:46:59.517 align:middle line:84%
and creates little kernels of
information and it feeds us

00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:02.654 align:middle line:84%
to the conscious mind --
or the conscious brain --

00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:07.592 align:middle line:84%
so the brain can feel it's
alive, but only along pathways

00:47:07.592 --> 00:47:10.795 align:middle line:84%
that the human has
given meaning to.

00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:13.765 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't give meaning
to it, it will not pass

00:47:13.765 --> 00:47:16.134 align:middle line:84%
that information because
it'll just be wasted.

00:47:16.134 --> 00:47:17.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: That
makes perfect sense.

00:47:17.302 --> 00:47:20.271 align:middle line:84%
Okay now so we take this
now all this technology.

00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:21.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: So
you give it meaning you say.

00:47:21.406 --> 00:47:23.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: You
give it meaning and so.

00:47:23.107 --> 00:47:24.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
You're creating it.

00:47:24.075 --> 00:47:24.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
You've created

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:25.843 align:middle line:90%
that with this experiment,

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:27.946 align:middle line:84%
with this Autism
Intention Experiment.

00:47:27.946 --> 00:47:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It's getting closer

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.449 align:middle line:84%
to the co-creation with
our spiritual parents.

00:47:31.449 --> 00:47:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:34.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: I
mean it is what we can do.

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Now how
do you view these kids now

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.221 align:middle line:84%
that you've had -- and
we're going to watch

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:39.624 align:middle line:84%
that video is just a
second of this kid.

00:47:39.624 --> 00:47:40.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Okay, well the -- my --

00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:41.392 align:middle line:90%
again I used my intuition.

00:47:41.392 --> 00:47:42.527 align:middle line:90%
What was -- what's the problem?

00:47:42.527 --> 00:47:44.896 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything
about autism,

00:47:44.896 --> 00:47:51.069 align:middle line:84%
and the thought I had was that
these are highly advanced souls

00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:57.642 align:middle line:84%
who are developed at
levels such that --

00:47:57.642 --> 00:48:00.311 align:middle line:84%
see you got to interface
with the bio bodysuit.

00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:01.612 align:middle line:90%
That seems to be the difficulty.

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:04.882 align:middle line:84%
They have difficulty getting
into the bio bodysuit,

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:08.353 align:middle line:84%
which is -- it has a
particular meridian system.

00:48:08.353 --> 00:48:10.955 align:middle line:84%
It has a particular
chakra system.

00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:14.859 align:middle line:84%
These advanced souls
will have chakra systems

00:48:14.859 --> 00:48:17.095 align:middle line:90%
and such far beyond that.

00:48:17.095 --> 00:48:17.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
And they're trying

00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:19.163 align:middle line:90%
to integrate with us still.

00:48:19.163 --> 00:48:20.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: The
way I look at it is think

00:48:20.665 --> 00:48:24.769 align:middle line:84%
of the human being
of our culture.

00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:29.073 align:middle line:84%
They might have a chakra
with sort of eight lobes.

00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:32.744 align:middle line:84%
Let's not talk about
what those things mean,

00:48:32.744 --> 00:48:37.115 align:middle line:84%
and the others might have
30 lobes, because they're

00:48:37.115 --> 00:48:40.752 align:middle line:84%
so advanced, and how
do they interface --

00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:42.787 align:middle line:90%
the two information systems?

00:48:42.787 --> 00:48:43.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:48:43.855 --> 00:48:44.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Now we're talking

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:45.390 align:middle line:90%
about phase transformation.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:46.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:47.291 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Now we're talking

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.393 align:middle line:90%
about interfaces between worlds.

00:48:48.393 --> 00:48:49.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: This
integration process.

00:48:49.794 --> 00:48:50.995 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
This integration process.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And
when they do, what we --

00:48:53.531 --> 00:48:56.768 align:middle line:84%
so what Suzy and I were talking
about is the incredible depth

00:48:56.768 --> 00:48:59.103 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom knowledge
science coming through,

00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:02.106 align:middle line:84%
and we talked a little
bit ago about Jacob.

00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:03.708 align:middle line:90%
Now let's watch this one.

00:49:03.708 --> 00:49:06.077 align:middle line:90%
He's about 14-years-old here,

00:49:06.077 --> 00:49:08.679 align:middle line:84%
and you can tell his
behavior is different.

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:11.015 align:middle line:84%
His enthusiasm levels
of the soul coming

00:49:11.015 --> 00:49:12.950 align:middle line:84%
through are just
astounding, but this is his.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Well,

00:49:14.018 --> 00:49:16.054 align:middle line:84%
one would love Ph.D.
students like that.

00:49:16.054 --> 00:49:16.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Yes [chuckles]

00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:18.456 align:middle line:90%
and let's watch Jacob now.

00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:23.227 align:middle line:84%
The way he sees the world
and himself is just amazing.

00:49:23.227 --> 00:49:25.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Jacob: Introduce
myself because I did not do

00:49:25.596 --> 00:49:32.437 align:middle line:84%
that at the beginning of the
talk [audience laughter],

00:49:32.437 --> 00:49:35.973 align:middle line:84%
so about 11 years
ago I was diagnosed

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:39.110 align:middle line:90%
with this thing called autism.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:48.186 align:middle line:84%
What that meant was I
was focusing in things

00:49:49.587 --> 00:49:51.789 align:middle line:84%
in such extreme detail that
[audience laughter] it seemed

00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:52.623 align:middle line:90%
like I wasn't thinking at all.

00:49:52.623 --> 00:49:53.958 align:middle line:90%
Basically I'd be like, "Oh look.

00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:54.892 align:middle line:84%
Here's this reflection of
that light, so there's a light

00:49:54.892 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:84%
up here, but oh there's
my shadow,

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.128 align:middle line:84%
so there's a light back there
and I look over and it's

00:49:57.128 --> 00:49:58.296 align:middle line:84%
over there [audience
laughter] okay.

00:49:58.296 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:84%
[Chuckles] Okay, so
because of that, you know,

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:00.565 align:middle line:84%
people thought I would never
learn because it just looked

00:50:00.565 --> 00:50:01.699 align:middle line:84%
like I was staring
into the open.

00:50:01.699 --> 00:50:02.733 align:middle line:84%
It looked like I wasn't
doing anything at all,

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:03.301 align:middle line:84%
so people told me I
would never learn.

00:50:03.301 --> 00:50:03.868 align:middle line:90%
I'd never think.

00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:04.702 align:middle line:90%
I'd never talk.

00:50:04.702 --> 00:50:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I'd never tie my shoes, which --

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:09.006 align:middle line:84%
okay, they might have
had a point on, you know.

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:10.341 align:middle line:84%
I'm wearing sandals
[audience laughter],

00:50:10.341 --> 00:50:13.277 align:middle line:84%
so [chuckles] you know, but
however, at that age I went

00:50:13.277 --> 00:50:18.549 align:middle line:84%
to the Barnes and Noble, and I
got a textbook and from the data

00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:20.852 align:middle line:84%
that was in the textbook
I derived Capra's laws

00:50:20.852 --> 00:50:23.287 align:middle line:84%
when I wasn't supposed to
be learning or thinking

00:50:23.287 --> 00:50:24.388 align:middle line:90%
at all [audience laughter].

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:27.358 align:middle line:84%
So basically from the
other people's point

00:50:27.358 --> 00:50:29.627 align:middle line:90%
of view it was just, you know,

00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:30.995 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't really
looking too good.

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:32.897 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't finger painting
or doing story time or any

00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:35.399 align:middle line:84%
of the other stuff the two,
three, four-year-olds would do,

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:39.737 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, what they did
was because of that they took me

00:50:39.737 --> 00:50:42.807 align:middle line:84%
to Special Ed, which
is extremely special

00:50:42.807 --> 00:50:44.308 align:middle line:84%
in the fact it didn't educate
me [audience laughter].

00:50:44.308 --> 00:50:48.779 align:middle line:84%
[Chuckles] So during that
time I had to stop learning

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:54.685 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
have a way to learn.

00:50:54.685 --> 00:50:58.623 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was just in Special
Ed, so what they would do is,

00:50:58.623 --> 00:51:00.925 align:middle line:90%
you know, okay, so I wasn't able

00:51:00.925 --> 00:51:02.426 align:middle line:84%
to learn [chuckles]
anything at all.

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:05.997 align:middle line:84%
However, at that age I started
thinking about things in sort

00:51:05.997 --> 00:51:07.765 align:middle line:84%
of the way of oh
all these shadows,

00:51:07.765 --> 00:51:10.434 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's why I
like astrophysics, physics

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:13.838 align:middle line:84%
and math today because
I had to stop learning.

00:51:13.838 --> 00:51:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's why
I do what I do today.

00:51:17.308 --> 00:51:18.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: So the name

00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:21.245 align:middle line:84%
of his talk was Forget
What You Know.

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:23.147 align:middle line:90%
We need to forget what we know,

00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:26.150 align:middle line:84%
so that you can remember
what truly is,

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.786 align:middle line:84%
and I just love this
little fellow.

00:51:28.786 --> 00:51:32.523 align:middle line:84%
I mean -- and the thing is, as
Suzy and I were talking about,

00:51:32.523 --> 00:51:34.892 align:middle line:84%
once this -- as you
say this phase.

00:51:34.892 --> 00:51:35.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you call it?

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.894 align:middle line:90%
A phase shift?

00:51:36.894 --> 00:51:38.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Phase transformation.

00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:39.197 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Phase
transformation happens

00:51:39.197 --> 00:51:41.833 align:middle line:84%
and these beings with
say 30 chakras come

00:51:41.833 --> 00:51:44.001 align:middle line:90%
into this eight chakra system,

00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:50.041 align:middle line:84%
that's what we have
to look forward to.

00:51:50.041 --> 00:51:51.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yep.

00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:56.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And so what
is your perception now looking

00:51:56.214 --> 00:51:58.316 align:middle line:90%
-- backing up and looking at it.

00:51:58.316 --> 00:52:01.385 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
the technology.

00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:03.221 align:middle line:90%
We know how it interfaces.

00:52:03.221 --> 00:52:06.357 align:middle line:84%
Like Suzy says, you have a new
experiment coming up in July

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:10.261 align:middle line:84%
of 2013, very quickly here and
we're going to be getting back

00:52:10.261 --> 00:52:12.597 align:middle line:84%
with her on the data once
you have a good year.

00:52:12.597 --> 00:52:13.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yes.

00:52:13.931 --> 00:52:14.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So we see
that it's working already.

00:52:14.932 --> 00:52:16.167 align:middle line:90%
We know that it's working.

00:52:16.167 --> 00:52:17.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Yes, it's working robustly.

00:52:17.535 --> 00:52:20.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And so now
let's get into who these --

00:52:20.338 --> 00:52:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the nature of these kids
and what it means for them

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:29.146 align:middle line:84%
to even attempt to come
into this dense frequency

00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:38.222 align:middle line:84%
and this limited body system at
this time, in this epoch period.

00:52:40.625 --> 00:52:41.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
It's a challenge.

00:52:41.592 --> 00:52:45.296 align:middle line:84%
I mean I would think
that it would be

00:52:45.296 --> 00:52:52.670 align:middle line:84%
like a space traveler being
born to a mother of our far,

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:54.939 align:middle line:90%
far Neanderthal ancestors.

00:52:54.939 --> 00:52:56.907 align:middle line:90%
I mean.

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:57.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:52:57.608 --> 00:52:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Good way to liken it.

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:04.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yeah, so
the -- it's wonderfully serious.

00:53:04.248 --> 00:53:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know enough yet.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:12.757 align:middle line:84%
I'm just excited that this
new energy that we're working

00:53:12.757 --> 00:53:16.761 align:middle line:84%
with I can -- we can
broadcast around the --

00:53:16.761 --> 00:53:18.062 align:middle line:90%
anywhere around in the world.

00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:19.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And you
can do it for any purpose.

00:53:19.964 --> 00:53:21.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Seemingly.

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: In fact
when I first came in --

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.068 align:middle line:84%
well it wasn't the first
time I saw you in a room,

00:53:24.068 --> 00:53:27.004 align:middle line:84%
but I remember was
about eight years ago,

00:53:27.004 --> 00:53:29.774 align:middle line:84%
and it was at a private
gathering have to do

00:53:29.774 --> 00:53:32.843 align:middle line:84%
with brain state technology
and shifting brain states

00:53:32.843 --> 00:53:35.846 align:middle line:84%
through an advanced
kind of neuro feedback,

00:53:35.846 --> 00:53:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and that device was being
talked about at that time.

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:41.986 align:middle line:84%
Just to give us an idea,
why were you there?

00:53:41.986 --> 00:53:45.089 align:middle line:84%
What were you looking at in
terms of broadcast at that time?

00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
Well at that point

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:51.195 align:middle line:84%
in time it was Lee Gerdes and
I were trying to find a match

00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:53.898 align:middle line:90%
between our two things.

00:53:53.898 --> 00:53:56.834 align:middle line:90%
He had a technology in hand.

00:53:56.834 --> 00:54:01.372 align:middle line:84%
I had one I'd been working on
for a long time that allowed us

00:54:01.372 --> 00:54:04.642 align:middle line:84%
to get into other
levels of reality.

00:54:04.642 --> 00:54:12.216 align:middle line:84%
He was -- and so I thought that
one could condition the space

00:54:12.216 --> 00:54:15.519 align:middle line:84%
where he is doing his work, and
he would be able to do many,

00:54:15.519 --> 00:54:18.522 align:middle line:84%
many more things
than as it is now.

00:54:18.522 --> 00:54:21.125 align:middle line:84%
I mean he's doing
wonderful things as it is,

00:54:21.125 --> 00:54:22.860 align:middle line:90%
but we can go far beyond that.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.496 align:middle line:84%
It's the conditioning of
the space that's important.

00:54:25.496 --> 00:54:28.265 align:middle line:90%
It turns out that the space --

00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:31.035 align:middle line:84%
see we got these wonderful
experimental results.

00:54:31.035 --> 00:54:32.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:54:32.169 --> 00:54:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
And then we said, "Okay.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.472 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look over
at the space itself,"

00:54:34.472 --> 00:54:37.274 align:middle line:84%
and so we did a bunch --
whole bunch of experiments

00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and we got magnetic
effects that are just --

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:44.048 align:middle line:84%
you could never get them in our
normal distance time reality.

00:54:44.048 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:84%
They just don't happen
because in this --

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:48.619 align:middle line:90%
we have only magnetic dipoles

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:51.322 align:middle line:84%
in our normal distance
time reality,

00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:55.559 align:middle line:84%
and we were getting
effects that could come

00:54:55.559 --> 00:55:00.364 align:middle line:84%
from magnetic monopoles,
okay, which had been studied

00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:04.068 align:middle line:84%
around the world by scientists
spending billions of dollars

00:55:04.068 --> 00:55:05.436 align:middle line:90%
to find magnetic monopoles.

00:55:05.436 --> 00:55:06.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
What is the significance

00:55:06.771 --> 00:55:07.905 align:middle line:90%
in laypersons' terms?

00:55:07.905 --> 00:55:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
In laypersons' terms,

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.842 align:middle line:90%
we have electric charges.

00:55:11.842 --> 00:55:14.779 align:middle line:84%
Most people know about
positive and negative charges.

00:55:14.779 --> 00:55:17.982 align:middle line:90%
Those are monopoles, all right?

00:55:17.982 --> 00:55:26.390 align:middle line:84%
If they interact, that would
be a dipole, so all at the --

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.294 align:middle line:84%
mainly it's an electrical
system in this world,

00:55:30.294 --> 00:55:33.497 align:middle line:84%
so movement of electric
charge, which is current,

00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:38.269 align:middle line:84%
that creates -- induces a
magnetic field in the space.

00:55:38.269 --> 00:55:40.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And that
field can be impregnated with?

00:55:40.538 --> 00:55:43.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: But
it's always a dipole field.

00:55:43.474 --> 00:55:49.180 align:middle line:84%
At our normal reality all the
magnetism is dipoles, all right,

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:53.551 align:middle line:84%
but a magnetic monopole all
by itself people look for.

00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:54.919 align:middle line:90%
They didn't find.

00:55:54.919 --> 00:55:58.122 align:middle line:84%
They said, therefore, it should
occur because of symmetries

00:55:58.122 --> 00:56:00.791 align:middle line:90%
in physics, but it didn't.

00:56:00.791 --> 00:56:04.161 align:middle line:84%
They said it didn't because
they'd run the experiments,

00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:08.466 align:middle line:84%
but the experiments were
never in a conditioned space.

00:56:08.466 --> 00:56:12.503 align:middle line:84%
They didn't change the
consciousness of their space.

00:56:12.503 --> 00:56:15.606 align:middle line:84%
We changed the consciousness
of the space.

00:56:15.606 --> 00:56:18.275 align:middle line:84%
We found we could get
information entanglement.

00:56:18.275 --> 00:56:20.478 align:middle line:84%
We found we could get
coherence links that were --

00:56:20.478 --> 00:56:24.949 align:middle line:84%
the whole room and larger
whereas normally, when you talk

00:56:24.949 --> 00:56:28.552 align:middle line:84%
about molecules and making them
coherent you might get five

00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:29.687 align:middle line:90%
or 10.

00:56:29.687 --> 00:56:33.257 align:middle line:84%
That would be wonderful,
but we can room size.

00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:35.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Room
size, now this device

00:56:35.793 --> 00:56:38.295 align:middle line:84%
that you're conditioning
the rooms

00:56:38.295 --> 00:56:40.598 align:middle line:90%
with this consciousness with,

00:56:40.598 --> 00:56:42.600 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned earlier
that it's commercial.

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.969 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean it's actually
commercially available?

00:56:44.969 --> 00:56:46.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Well
the un-imprinted device is.

00:56:46.504 --> 00:56:48.305 align:middle line:90%
We sell it on our website.

00:56:48.305 --> 00:56:49.440 align:middle line:90%
People can.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: The
un-imprinted devices?

00:56:50.808 --> 00:56:52.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Yeah,
they could get one by PayPal.

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:53.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Then how
do you get the really clear

00:56:53.644 --> 00:56:55.012 align:middle line:90%
conscious intention.

00:56:55.012 --> 00:56:56.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Ah, you
have to be able to imprint.

00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:58.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:56:58.382 --> 00:57:02.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Now, in
my case we've had replication,

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:04.755 align:middle line:90%
but we have always provided.

00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: The imprint.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:07.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
The imprinted device.

00:57:07.191 --> 00:57:08.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:09.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: Because
of the special relationship

00:57:09.994 --> 00:57:15.366 align:middle line:84%
that seems to exist
between us and the unseen,

00:57:15.366 --> 00:57:17.067 align:middle line:90%
and these are higher dimensions.

00:57:17.067 --> 00:57:17.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Sure.

00:57:17.635 --> 00:57:18.636 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:57:18.636 --> 00:57:19.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
People far --

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:21.772 align:middle line:84%
beings beyond, and I
don't ask where they are,

00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:23.140 align:middle line:90%
but they're pretty special.

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:27.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah, so
how's the average Joe imprint?

00:57:27.244 --> 00:57:28.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller:
That's the question.

00:57:28.479 --> 00:57:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
You don't know yet?

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: I
mean I've been imprinting

00:57:30.881 --> 00:57:34.385 align:middle line:84%
for 45 years, or I've been
meditating for 45 years.

00:57:34.385 --> 00:57:35.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:36.587 align:middle line:90%
You're not the average Joe.

00:57:36.587 --> 00:57:37.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. William Tiller: So -- and
the people that work with me,

00:57:37.922 --> 00:57:43.294 align:middle line:84%
they -- they're siddhi yoga
practitioners for 30 years,

00:57:43.294 --> 00:57:50.434 align:middle line:84%
35 years and if we get the funds
to expand, I will want everybody

00:57:50.434 --> 00:57:52.469 align:middle line:90%
to be working on themselves.

00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:54.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And
thank you so much again.

00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:56.574 align:middle line:84%
