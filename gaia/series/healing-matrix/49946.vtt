>>REGINA MEREDITH:
One of the subjects

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:10%
that intrigues us above all else
is what happens after we die.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
For dream-work
author Robert Moss,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:10%
the journey began with
illness and unseen companions.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:84%
These silvery beings that
glowed with inner light

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:90%
worked on his little body.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
He felt at home
among them, but had

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
to return to his
body and earth life

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:90%
to tell a lifetime of stories.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Robert is with us today to
share his remarkable life story.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to see you again.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed you a couple
of other times about your work,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:90%
but this is the backstory.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:84%
The boy who died and came back,
that's your backstory of life.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And what an interesting
life you've had.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the type of life
you read about in novels

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
of shamans and their
early start in life.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you did
start out in a wild part

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:90%
of the world, Australia.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT MOSS: Very wild part.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.807 align:middle line:84%
Good to be dreaming with
you in Boulder, Regina.

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yeah.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:10%
When I was three
years old, my mother

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:10%
decided to take me from
the east coast of Australia

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:10%
to West Australia, where
her Irish family lived,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.087 align:middle line:10%
to meet them and particularly
to meet her aunt-- Auntie Dick,

00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:10%
we called her.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:10%
The opera singer--

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Auntie Dick.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.596 align:middle line:10%
>>MOSS: Auntie Dick.

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:24.962 align:middle line:10%
The opera singer--

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The opera
singer, of course.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MOSS: --a friend of
Dame Nellie Melba--

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:10%
who was a clairvoyant.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.153 align:middle line:10%
She didn't make a fuss about it.

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:10%
She would just read for people.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Auntie Dick
was a clairvoyant?

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.884 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yes,
including the Prince

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:84%
of Wales with whom she danced
in the theater in Perth

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:90%
A rather grand lady.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And she's reading
the tea leaves,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:90%
the old fashioned thing.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at my tea leaves,
turns the cup upside down,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle line:84%
leaves the room
and will not speak.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards we heard
the stories, she

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:90%
saw my death in the tea leaves.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm three years old.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:90%
She was correct.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:84%
That might seem like
a ridiculous statement

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
since I'm sitting
with you right now,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.886 align:middle line:84%
but that winter I died in
a hospital in Tasmania.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And I was pronounced dead--

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
three years old.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Three years old,
I was pronounced dead.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.297 align:middle line:84%
By every sign they could
measure, I was dead.

00:02:04.297 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
When I came back, the
doctors were very surprised.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
And they said to my
parents, aw, your boy.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.880 align:middle line:90%
He died, and he came back.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.429 align:middle line:90%
Didn't he?

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's the title of
the book, and that's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.511 align:middle line:84%
the way I've thought of myself
ever since-- the boy who

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:90%
died and came back.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you much
about what I was doing out

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.227 align:middle line:90%
of the body, age three.

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you it
was very hard living

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
in the body in this world
for the years that followed.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.416 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it must have
been, because you experienced

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
a totally different non-physical
reality and this is so dense.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes, and I came back.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Living in a body was like
trying to drive an automobile

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.461 align:middle line:84%
without being-- reach the
petals with your little feet,

00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
without any driving
instructions.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:90%
When I was nine, I died again.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's, perhaps, a
more interesting story.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.556 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, now.

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get into that.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But there is something
else about you

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.279 align:middle line:84%
that was very
peculiar-- well, there

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.863 align:middle line:84%
are many things about you
that are peculiar, actually.

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:49.154 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: I've been called worse.

00:02:49.154 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING TOGETHER]

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Since this is
the third time we've met.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
You had this posh,
little British accent.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
not what happens

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:90%
in that part of the world.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.774 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:02:58.774 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I had to put on
an Aussie accent.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.721 align:middle line:84%
I could do it, but
it wasn't natural.

00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would sound like a proper
little Brit who'd just arrived.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And old enough to be mocked by
the kids in my neighborhood,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to turn it into this.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did
you have this accent?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.313 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I grew up with the
memories of a Royal Air Force

00:03:12.313 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
pilot in Britain,
who had belonged

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.245 align:middle line:84%
to a magical in Britain but
wanted to fight and fought

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and was shot down
over Holland in 1941.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.766 align:middle line:84%
I seem to have his life
memories, including knowledge

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric things
that he liked.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
For example, I always
knew the tarot long

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:90%
before I found a tarot deck.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And I knew not only
how to read the tarot

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
but how it was used
in ritual and ceremony

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
in a certain kind of
esoteric tradition.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up, and the memories
of his landscapes, his lives,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:90%
his relationships were with me.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he obviously
went to a posh public school.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Well, absolutely.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Why not? [LAUGHS]

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.406 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:90%
So you had his accent.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
You come back as a
little tyke in Australia

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.825 align:middle line:90%
with this posh British--

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: My parents
would say from time,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
oh, the stork got
the babies mixed up.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Where's our little Aussie kid?

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
We got the bloody,
little English lord.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So in early childhood, there
was also that-- the problem

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.214 align:middle line:84%
of living with the memories
of another lifetime.

00:04:03.214 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a straightforward
view about reincarnation.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
However, I would accept
that I'm closely connected

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:90%
to the life of that man.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:90%
In the 1930s--

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, and others.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:90%
You've remember many others too.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.241 align:middle line:90%
It's come in waves.

00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:90%
It's come in waves.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.735 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, one of
the conclusions I've

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
had to form about life
based on my experience

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:84%
is we are connected with
dramas and personalities

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
in different times--
past, future, parallel,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:90%
and in other dimensions.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
They're part of
our current story.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.457 align:middle line:84%
Certain choices we make can
mobilize an active connection

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:90%
with one of these personalities.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, it because
really exciting; doesn't it?

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the dramas and
personalities from somewhere

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
else are erupting into
the present reality.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes as
if we're stepping

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
into that other
time or dimension

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.305 align:middle line:84%
and engaging with people
there, all at the same time.

00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very true.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.888 align:middle line:84%
You know, one thing
I've noticed is

00:04:46.888 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
that, depending on who I'm with
and what the circumstances,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.090 align:middle line:84%
the whole cadence of my
speech-- the words I use--

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
are completely different in one
conversation versus another.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've often wondered
if it's because it's

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:90%
triggered by something.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's that
person literally,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's the frequency
of that person triggering

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:90%
something from someplace else.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yes These
triggers are fascinating.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the trigger
is a landscape.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:90%
We move to a certain place.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.720 align:middle line:84%
We enter a certain landscape,
and the memories of a life

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
lived in that
environment come to us.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
That happened to be in midlife.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I decided to escape
big cities, live

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:90%
on a farm in upstate New York.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I bought a lot of land.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.646 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd get to know
the trees and the animals,

00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:84%
put down some roots
in my adopted country.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I found myself dreaming, both
in night dreams and in visions--

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous visions--
of people who

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.324 align:middle line:90%
lived in the area 300 years ago.

00:05:35.324 --> 00:05:37.531 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and we're
going to get into that story.

00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:38.430 align:middle line:90%
That is a big story.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:84%
That was a big influence
on your life; wasn't it?

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
This was the turning
point in midlife.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
This was dying and
coming back, not

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.931 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
being in the hospital

00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
but of changing
your life radically.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.011 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Now at nine, you did die again?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: I did.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.321 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go to the
time you died at nine,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:90%
and where you went.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And these silvery beings
and who was working on you.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.546 align:middle line:84%
And go all the way through
and talk about the moongate.

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: The moongate.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm rushed to hospital, Saint
Andrews hospital in Melbourne

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because I've complained of
discomfort in my lower abdomen.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:90%
My appendix is about to erupt.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I've just been in
hospital with pneumonia.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They're doing
emergency appendectomy,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.686 align:middle line:90%
and I slip out of the body.

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at the
surgery and the knives

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and the blood and
the good nurses

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:84%
talking and looking down
from under the ceiling.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to be there.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I leave the room.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten,
really, that there's

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:90%
a body on the operating table.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:90%
I see my mother grieving.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be with
her, watching her pain

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and feeling guilty
for making her so sad.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a normal,
nine-year-old kid.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:90%
I want to go to the beach.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to go to that theme park
down the beach in Melbourne,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Lunar Park, just for fun.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a big moon face.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the gate to the
theme park, and you

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.179 align:middle line:84%
walk through the mouth of the
moon to enter the theme park.

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:47.594 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
go on the rides,

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:90%
look at girls in summer dresses.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you're out of body.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you need
an admission ticket.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yeah, I
don't need a ticket.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten about the
body in the operating room.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I go through the moongate, and
suddenly I'm not in Lunar Park.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm pulled into a world
that is quite different.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.979 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a world
inside the world.

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:90%
The beings are beautiful.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
They're humanoid, but they're
not quite like the people

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:90%
up top.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:90%
They're silvery.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.584 align:middle line:90%
They're luminous.

00:07:07.584 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:90%
They're elegant.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:90%
They're terribly tall.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.405 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're terribly
tall and skinny even

00:07:11.405 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:90%
by Boulder standards.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And they welcome me
as one of their own.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%
And they raised me.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.146 align:middle line:90%
They didn't just work on me.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:84%
They do something to
me, but they raise me.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm suddenly engaged
and living a whole life

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:90%
with these people.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And it seems as if
I grow to adulthood.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I know the love of their women.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I become a father,
a grandfather.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of shaman or elder.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how
long this takes.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 90 years in mortal time.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Maybe more.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And eventually that
body is used up.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not immortal.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm going to go
to some place among the stars,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:84%
but suddenly I'm pulled
back into the body

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
of a nine-year-old in
a Melbourne hospital

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
room, remembering.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Very hard.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to go into
that a little bit more.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And I know you were talking
with your driver on the way in.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want to
hear more about that part.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Write a whole book
about it, what

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
it was like with
the silvery beings.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Not very many people have
the cognizant memory, anyway,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
of being with beings from other
cultures-- off-planet cultures,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:90%
other-dimensional cultures.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:90%
What was life among them like?

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And how was it differing from
what you experienced on earth?

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And all the ways?

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, there
was a full experience

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:90%
of pleasure and pain.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.935 align:middle line:84%
And to that extent,
it's a physical reality.

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a reality in which we know
pleasure and pain, feelings

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:90%
that are strong.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
all sorts of things

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.823 align:middle line:84%
can be accomplished by
thought, which humans

00:08:27.823 --> 00:08:29.939 align:middle line:84%
can't do in the
dense material form.

00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Things can be done.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Things can be
constructed very quickly.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, reality creation is
something that is understood.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:84%
You can create things very
quickly by imagination.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.797 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
connection, a heart bond,

00:08:39.797 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:84%
between people, which
is quite lovely.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.789 align:middle line:84%
You feel that you're in the
most heart-centered community

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
of people who love each
other, support each other.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any impressions
of war, violence, competition,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
or jealousy amongst these
people, for example.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have the sense that
there is an immense depth

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
of community with
them, which I loved.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:90%
They became my family.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.700 align:middle line:90%
I loved this family.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to leave
them, except that I

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:90%
had lived a whole life.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like being
forced to come back.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like a
natural progression.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And the end of that
progression, there

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:84%
was the return, or the
descent, into a body

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
in a certain landscape in
Australia in the 1950s.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you feel that that
might be, on some level, a soul

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.645 align:middle line:84%
family of yours that
you had been with before

00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:90%
or will be with in the future?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think that I will
be with a family like that

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that even though
I didn't have clarity on it

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
when I came back at nine,
I may have come back

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:90%
on assignment into this world.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.949 align:middle line:84%
An assignment that I'm trying
to understand and fulfill.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think that all
of us have soul assignments,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
sacred assignments
in this world,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.721 align:middle line:84%
and that we might do better
when we remember some

00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:42.596 align:middle line:84%
of the elements
of what those are.

00:09:42.596 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I also
found interesting

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
is that around that time you met
a little aboriginal boy named

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Jacko.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I love what he had to
say to you, because it's

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.368 align:middle line:84%
the first time you really--
It sounds like you really

00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
had kind of reinforcement
for this kind of experience

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
in life that was common to
the aboriginals in Australia.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.774 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, Jacko gave me a
very simple matter-of-fact way

00:10:02.774 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:84%
of understanding
these things when

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I needed a model
of understanding.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.416 align:middle line:90%
My society wasn't giving me one.

00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:90%
He'd say, oh, yeah?

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
We do that.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:84%
We get real sick, we go
and live with the spirits.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
well, we come back.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we're the same,
and sometimes we're not.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're in
a different body.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: We might be different.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.846 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, that was
very helpful to me.

00:10:20.846 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it was very hard for me,
in a conservative era growing

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
up in a military
family in Australia,

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:90%
to talk about any of this.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.162 align:middle line:84%
Had I had my mother's
Irish family closer,

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I might have heard
about people who

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.762 align:middle line:84%
were taken away by the sidhe,
by the fairies and returned.

00:10:34.762 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And that might or
might not have given me

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
a context of understanding.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Much later when I went back
to Australia as an adult,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I saw paintings from Arnhem
Land of people called

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Mimi spirits-- very, very
ancient spirits of the land

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and the Otherworld,
an aboriginal belief.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And they looked a bit like the
tall, elegant, silvery beings.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.502 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know what
to call them then,

00:10:54.502 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and I still don't know
what to call them.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:90%
A soul family will do.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
A soul community will
do as a description.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say
they were humanoid?

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did they have hair on
their heads or was it more--

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I don't think
they had very much hair.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they cared
about clothes very much.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.782 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think they
were confined to one form.

00:11:09.782 --> 00:11:11.198 align:middle line:84%
I mean their forms
were malleable.

00:11:11.198 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to
stay in humanoid form.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
They could take other
forms-- animal-like forms,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:90%
bird-like forms.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're in a
different kind of reality.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I sort of flow them
together in my mind now

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:84%
with visions and soul memories
I've had from later in life.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But just to stick to the
experience at the time

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:84%
as I remember it, I didn't
know what to call these people.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But I know that being
with them felt like home.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like
being with people

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.285 align:middle line:84%
who are full of love and
understanding and knowledge

00:11:35.285 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and can change
things by thought.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:84%
The kind of place where
I really yearned to be.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where we
all yearn to be.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And because you
couldn't keep dying,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
although you've tried
certainly many times.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:90%
How many times?

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:84%
You had pneumonia
every year; right?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I had pneumonia 12 times
between the ages of 3 and 11.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.462 align:middle line:90%
It's excessive.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were really trying
to climb out of this body.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.252 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: The only
way to understand

00:11:55.252 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
it is this little kid really
wanted to be somewhere else

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.253 align:middle line:90%
and wanted to leave.

00:11:58.253 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I would confess that
that is probably

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:90%
the fundamental explanation.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:90%
At 11 I stopped dying.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I had a great vision
going home from school one

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:90%
day, in the sky.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:90%
The sky seemed to open.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I saw a staff of burning
bronze with a serpent wrapped

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:90%
around it, filling half the sky.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:90%
I got very sick that night.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I died in
terms of losing vital signs,

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
but I got pneumonia
for the last time.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.254 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
never got it again.

00:12:21.254 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
My parents were very interested
in this vision in the sky.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It's something I'm seeing
with my ordinary eyes

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:90%
so we could talk about that.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:90%
They encouraged me to draw it.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I made a painting
of it later on.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I now recognize that
what I saw in the sky

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
was very like the
symbol of healing--

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Caduceus.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: The serpent
staff of healing

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
of Asclepius, the god of dream
healing of the ancient Greeks.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And a symbol that
we still honor,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.250 align:middle line:84%
still see on ambulances,
hospital doors,

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:90%
medical letterhead.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.696 align:middle line:84%
Even though people
don't remember,

00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
it's a symbol of a
god-- a divine power

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:90%
that heals in a certain way.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So that was the sort of seal,
the signateur, the sign,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
the secret handshake from
the world that told me, OK.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the last time you
need to die like this.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in lieu
of that, let's talk

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:90%
about the Big Guy or Big Man.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:90%
The Big Man.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.612 align:middle line:84%
Because this I find
very interesting.

00:13:06.612 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I think this is actually
very relevant to everyone,

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:90%
whatever their life story is.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And the preface
to it very briefly

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is I think we can go back to a
younger version of ourselves.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
We can travel back
in time mentally

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:84%
to a younger
version of ourselves

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and give them support
and encouragement

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.850 align:middle line:90%
in their own time.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Amongst the invisible
companions who

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
helped me when I was a sick
and lonely kid in Australia

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
was a big guy with white
hair and a pink face,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.246 align:middle line:90%
like the favorite uncle--

00:13:31.246 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of like you.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: --I'd never had.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Who would sort of come and sit
on the bed in my perception

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and say things
like, look, Robert.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.441 align:middle line:84%
I know you're feeling
sorry for yourself.

00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But you're going
to make it through.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I promise.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:90%
You're going to survive.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.466 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling lonely.

00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:90%
I know, kid.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But you'll know the love of
women, and they'll love you.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And you find it hard
to tell your stories.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.511 align:middle line:84%
But I promise you the day
will come when a lot of people

00:13:50.511 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:90%
will want to hear your dreams.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:84%
You'll be up on a
platform, and you'll

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
have hundreds or
thousands of people

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:90%
who want to hear your dreams.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:84%
This was the experience
of my boyhood self.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a result of an
adult self, younger

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
than I now am, consciously
traveling back across time

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to the kid to say
those things to him.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
that's one of things

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:90%
that got young Robert through.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe,
Regina, that we can do this.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Any of us can do it
for our younger selves.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
parenting yourself, really.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the implication
is that you

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.336 align:middle line:90%
had moved beyond time and space.

00:14:22.336 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: I think we all can.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think every
night in our dreams,

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we
remember our dreams

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
or have any clue
about what's going,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I think we escape linear
time and the confines

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:90%
of body and brain.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.522 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In dream time.

00:14:31.522 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:84%
But you weren't in dream
time when this happened.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I'm
consciously going back.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm entering a
conscious visionary state,

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
traveling back
like a shaman who's

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.969 align:middle line:84%
learned to travel
outside time and space.

00:14:40.969 --> 00:14:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But as your
perception as a little boy,

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
you were seeing
you in the future.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, as a little boy I
didn't know who I was seeing.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But I have multiple
sets of memories here.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:90%
I have the memory of--

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
have all your features.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.964 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I have the
memory of the Robert

00:14:53.964 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
in his '40s who's going
back to his younger self.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And I have the members
of the younger self who's

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.526 align:middle line:84%
seeing this big
guy, doesn't quite

00:14:59.526 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
know who he is except that his
presence is very comforting,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
very supportive.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:84%
He's the mentor, the counselor,
the cheerleader the boy needed.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.154 align:middle line:84%
I think we can all play that
function to our own younger

00:15:09.154 --> 00:15:09.653 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:15:09.653 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
think we can all

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
check in with our older
self too, hopefully

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:90%
the one who's doing all right.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.629 align:middle line:84%
And see if we can
learn from him or her

00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
about the challenges
and opportunities that

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:90%
lie on the roads ahead.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so do you believe
you can alter your reality then

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
by going back in time, now,
and talking to that child.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And maybe planting other seeds
within the nine-year-old boy.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Can you alter some
future outcome from you

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:90%
where you are now?

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.179 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I think the
answer is "yes, and."

00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Not "yes, but," but "yes, and."

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can alter your reality.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
You'll certainly alter
your experience of reality

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:84%
in a way that can be healing
and supportive for the younger

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:84%
self, the present self,
and even the future self.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
If you were to alter
the events of the life,

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:84%
you would split off into
a parallel universe,

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.929 align:middle line:84%
with different logic than the
one you're currently living.

00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you split off into
that parallel universe,

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:84%
you might or not remember
if the event track

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:90%
you were on before was similar.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Physics allows for
this possibility,

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that we can change
events at one time track.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:84%
The result is to
split the universe.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you do
believe in parallel--

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.854 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely believe in it.

00:16:09.854 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And I also teach
people experientially

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
to go into parallel
universes, parallel lifetimes

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and learn directly what
that means for you.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:90%
So I think we can do that way.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But even if we can't
change the events,

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
we can change the
experience of the events

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
supportive of healing.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:25.882 align:middle line:90%
That is for sure.

00:16:25.882 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
will change the way

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:84%
we respond to life
in the future.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So do you know of any of
your parallel existences

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:90%
at this time in your life?

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, for
example, I used

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:84%
to be a bestselling
thriller writer.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'd started embarking
on writing historical spy

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
novels set in the period
of World War II, et cetera.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
In my dreams, on a
continuous basis year

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
after year after
year, I'm out there

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
in a world of daring do and
secret intrigue and research,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:84%
traveling across
time to see what's

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
going on in Russia
in 1943 or what's

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
going on in Ulaanbaatar,
Mongolia in 1937, et cetera.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.155 align:middle line:84%
Gathering the material
to continue the career

00:16:58.155 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
as a bestselling
historical spy novelist

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:90%
I left in the late 1980s.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is
very clear to me--

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that I'm on that track
in a parallel way.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:84%
And that I'm still on it
in a parallel reality.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were bringing
the information through.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.155 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a piece
of cake for you.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
You weren't having to
really create anything.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.346 align:middle line:84%
You were just drawing it
through from another reality?

00:17:15.346 --> 00:17:15.929 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Maybe.

00:17:15.929 --> 00:17:18.137 align:middle line:84%
But I'm responding to your
question about experiences

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:19.874 align:middle line:84%
right now of parallel
lives that are

00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
different from the one
we're currently living.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean I decided to leave
all that, with its glamour

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and excitement, on one side
to go off into the woods

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:90%
and live on a farm.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually adopted
a different path altogether.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and
we'll get to that part.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that aspect
of you that wrote the spy novels

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and had those
experiences still exists,

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:90%
living alongside this reality.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: He's still doing those
things in his own reality.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.864 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
the same for all

00:17:42.864 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:90%
of us, whatever our stories are.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:90%
You know, you change a partner.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:90%
You change a residence.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.553 align:middle line:84%
You go through the divorce
or the break up, for example.

00:17:49.553 --> 00:17:51.626 align:middle line:84%
You may notice in
your dreams, these

00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
are the first clues you may
get, that a parallel self of you

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
made a different
choice and is still

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.497 align:middle line:84%
with that person for
good, bad, or otherwise.

00:17:58.497 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Going forward aging in the
way you would be doing.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:90%
I've had those experiences too.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean after leaving
a relationship,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I have noticed in
dreams, sometimes

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
for as long as 10 years,
in a parallel reality.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you're
still with that person.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Aging at the same time.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Making choices we'd be making.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.068 align:middle line:84%
Doing things we'd be doing
if we were still together.

00:18:13.068 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes this enters the area
of soul loss and soul recovery.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's
related to the fact

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that when we make a
wrenching life choice,

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:84%
we lose a vital part of
our energy somewhere else.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So it opens a possibility
of profound healing

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
by giving us a way to reach
to a part of our souls

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that parted company
with us because

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:84%
of the difficult choice,
and bring it home.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So this also opens out into a
tremendously rich and important

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.535 align:middle line:90%
aspect of healing.

00:18:36.535 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Now you mentioned
that you knew you

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:84%
were going to ultimately
be loved by women.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And so this was obviously
very important, even

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:90%
as a little tyke for you.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:90%
And so one night, the hag came.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:84%
The dark goddess
came and got you.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: This was my first
experience in this body of sex.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm 14, and I've
never been kissed.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going through a
kind of sleep paralysis.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's something strange
going on, and I can't move.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
hideous, dark hag,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:84%
withered with bleeding heads
or skulls around her neck

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and multiple arms
like a spider--

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You asked for it.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --and
she's on top of me.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And she's forcing me
to have sex with me.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
know how to have sex.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But, you know,
I'm doing my best.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point in
the course of the night,

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
she shape shifts and becomes
this absolutely beautiful,

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.770 align:middle line:90%
beautiful young woman.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm given to
understand that I've

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:84%
had my personal vision of Kali--
of Kali Ma, of Kali mother.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And that the price of having
her in a beautiful form

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:84%
was to meet her in her
terrifying, take-no-prisoners,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:90%
crone form.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And that experience at age
14 has also shaped my life.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a
near-death experience,

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.467 align:middle line:84%
but it's a near-terror or
beyond-terror experience.

00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you write
about that in your other book,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:84%
but you gave me a
homework assignment

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:84%
to read a particular poem
about the dreams women dream.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously, this
being had a very deep impact

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
in terms of having a deep
respect and fear of women

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.330 align:middle line:90%
throughout your lifetime.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.663 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I wouldn't say that
I have a deep fear of women.

00:20:11.663 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that I have learned
to have the deepest respect,

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and that I respect
the goddess in women

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and respect the
goddess in the form

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
she takes in the different
landscapes that I visit.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've had many
encounters with the goddess.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.656 align:middle line:84%
And some of the chapters in
The Boy Who Died and Came Back

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:26.120 align:middle line:84%
are, of course,
about encountering

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:84%
the goddess of the land
in different landscapes

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.735 align:middle line:90%
and dealing with that.

00:20:29.735 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And you write some
beautiful poetry

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:90%
inspired by that as well.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And so now let's go
back into the time,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
you already alluded
to it earlier,

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
where you had memory of
this posh life in the RAF

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into that and
what that experience was.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And also is that a parallel
reality that exists for you?

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think that might
have been in the past?

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.414 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: I think both.

00:20:51.414 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I think in the multi-dimensional
universe, it's not either/or.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It's this and this and
this and this and this.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.798 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
he'd be old by now.

00:20:59.798 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Except in a multi-dimensional
universe, not necessarily.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I think that
in one parallel universe,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:84%
he died in 1941 under torture by
the Gestapo in the Netherlands.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I seem to know about
that and remember it.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.760 align:middle line:90%
He had a love affair.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Was hid for a time.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Was betrayed by a
Communist, actually,

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:84%
in the Dutch resistance to the
Gestapo and died under torture.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.652 align:middle line:84%
He was also a man
who knew the magic

00:21:22.652 --> 00:21:25.068 align:middle line:84%
of the Order of the Golden
Dawn and all that kind of thing

00:21:25.068 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:90%
in Britain in his time.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.919 align:middle line:84%
He was also a junior member
of a group that had access

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to Churchill, who was very
interested in fighting

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:90%
an occult war against the Nazis.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about that a little

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.495 align:middle line:84%
or do we have to read
your spy novels to get it?

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: You'll have to read
a novel I haven't written yet

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:90%
to understand that aspect.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Will you write that?

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Possibly.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:90%
If I'm pushed hard enough.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm trying to
encourage you to do this.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: If I'm spurred
mightily enough

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and if the goddess wishes
it, I suppose I can't say no.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.075 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so in one version of
his life, he dies in 1941,

00:21:54.075 --> 00:21:55.686 align:middle line:90%
and I seem to have his memories.

00:21:55.686 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a
reincarnationist,

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:84%
you might say, well, did
he pop into Robert's body?

00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:59.587 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he did.

00:21:59.587 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not straightforward
about reincarnation.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I think we are deeply connected
to lives in other times.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong about that.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But the exact nature
of the connection

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.170 align:middle line:84%
might be a little more
complex than we sometimes

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.470 align:middle line:90%
understand it to be.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:84%
In another reality,
he didn't die in 1941.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:84%
He went on living and went on
to do other things in his world,

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:90%
in his time track after that.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had a phobia
that started leading you

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:90%
to understanding this as well.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Anything that had steep
descent, stairs or anything,

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:90%
you were terrified.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that and
then in general these kinds

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.692 align:middle line:84%
of intense phobias that
we come into life with.

00:22:33.692 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I must say
that, my, you've

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.191 align:middle line:84%
got an excellent memory
for these things, Regina.

00:22:37.191 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And you focus on exactly
what matters, thank you.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I would say that sometimes
recollecting a past life

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
experience can be the
solution of a phobia.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I had an odd phobia about making
a descent at a certain angle

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.920 align:middle line:90%
into the dark.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Picture a long escalator going
down into a dark subway tunnel,

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.575 align:middle line:84%
I was once so scared
getting on the escalator

00:22:57.575 --> 00:23:01.129 align:middle line:84%
in the Bethesda subway sub
station in the metro DC area

00:23:01.129 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:90%
that I had to sit on the steps.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.269 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
is ridiculous, Robert.

00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
You're a grown man who's
survived all this stuff,

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.309 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting on the
steps of an escalator.

00:23:08.309 --> 00:23:10.094 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
understand this phobia.

00:23:10.094 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:90%
And then it suddenly hit me.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.801 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to do
anything special.

00:23:12.801 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:90%
It just came in on me.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:84%
It was the angle of descent of
a fighter bomber plane shot down

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:90%
over the Netherlands in 1941.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.159 align:middle line:84%
And once I saw that
from the cockpit,

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:84%
from-- I'm getting shivers
as I say this to you--

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:90%
the phobia was gone.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I remembered where this
particular fear came from,

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
about that particular
angle of descent.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I remembered a scene
from that life.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
that fear was gone.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:90%
I've never had that fear again.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and conversely,
someone like myself.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I have a fear of heights
and getting close

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to any kind of cliff or even
at the top of the Empire State

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Building.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But the very first
meditation I did

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:84%
in my life, formal meditation,
I did my little thing

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.880 align:middle line:84%
until I entered that calm
place and boom, this vision

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
appeared of a woman
in a red sari,

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:84%
hurling herself off of a very
steep cliff to her death.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
seeing in slow motion

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:84%
her sari rippling in the wind
as she fell to her death.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't look at
it when she splatted.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But I've had many other
memories from other times.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And assuming-- I mean I look
at it more as past lives.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, it could
be a parallel reality.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
"Slow learner" I think
is what it's called.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I think I fell to
my death many times.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And in this lifetime, I
about lose consciousness just

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.105 align:middle line:90%
to even look over the edge.

00:24:29.105 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So I 'll
tell you a story

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:84%
of what released me
from fear of heights.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.027 align:middle line:90%
It's not about past lives now.

00:24:34.027 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:84%
It's about our connection
with the animal spirits.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
hear this story?

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I would like to.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So I was in Peru,
I was up in Machu Picchu

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.667 align:middle line:90%
and so on 15 years ago.

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in the lobby
of the hotel, actually.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It's actually in Cuzco
in the lobby the hotel.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm sitting
there, I see a tiger

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:90%
walking through the lobby.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.697 align:middle line:84%
Tigers are not native
to South America.

00:24:54.697 --> 00:24:55.530 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy form.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And I know the tiger quite
well, and I look at it.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.549 align:middle line:84%
And I get the sense of
the tiger's saying to me,

00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to send something
to help you tonight.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Be ready."

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I work
with the animal spirits

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:90%
in the shaman's way.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm in my hotel
room-- it's not the coca leaf

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
tea that's doing
this either I think.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a valid and
authentic vision.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in my room at night.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I feel an energy presence in
the room, and I pay attention.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a puma.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the big cat of the
mountains of South America.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.862 align:middle line:84%
And not in human speech
but in mind-to-mind stuff,

00:25:22.862 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:90%
the puma says, "Look, Robert.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Big cats do not live
naturally at these altitudes.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:90%
You've just arrived.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
You need help to adjust
your body symptoms

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.732 align:middle line:84%
so you don't get
altitude sickness

00:25:32.732 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and deal with your
fear of heights.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me come into
your body, and I'll

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.792 align:middle line:84%
adjust your body so it'll
operate really well."

00:25:37.792 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.083 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So because
it's been correctly

00:25:40.083 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
introduced by a big
cat that I know,

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I let the energy of the
puma into my solar plexus.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it spreading
out through all the systems

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.110 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And for the next 10
days, Regina-- hey,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a Boulder, workout type.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an athletic
guy who goes and runs

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.945 align:middle line:90%
20 miles a day or something.

00:25:54.945 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I was the fittest, most capable
person on those mountain

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:84%
trails, absolutely
no fear of heights.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Whether you call it
autosuggestion, which is fine,

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.060 align:middle line:84%
or whether you call it access
to a kind of spiritual energy

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.675 align:middle line:84%
that is available
to us when we're

00:26:08.675 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
open to it, all of
our connectedness--

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
it was a very healing and
helpful moment for me.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.301 align:middle line:84%
But part of my story is about
recognizing our connections

00:26:16.301 --> 00:26:18.300 align:middle line:84%
with other life forms and
other forms of energy.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.216 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's go
into that because bear.

00:26:20.216 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:84%
The bear is also a very
important symbol to you.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
you and the bear.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about it,
again, in broad terms of how

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:84%
any one of us can choose to
access whichever animal we

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.695 align:middle line:90%
resonate with for assistance.

00:26:32.695 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: When I first
living in North America,

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I started having very
powerful dreams of the bear,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:84%
of a kind I do not remember
familiar in my life.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Australia has koalas.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:90%
They're cute.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%
They are not bears.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So there are no native
bears in my native country.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I dreamed again and again that
a giant bear is in my house,

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:90%
sometimes in my bedroom.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm scared of it because
it's bigger than I am.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not attacking me, but I'm
scared of something mightier

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.420 align:middle line:90%
than myself.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:90%
So I do this.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:90%
I put myself back in the dream.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a technique I teach to go
back inside a dream or vision

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and go on with it-- maybe
to resolve a terror,

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:90%
solve the mystery.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sitting
in an easy chair.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.165 align:middle line:84%
My intention is to meet the
bear and talk to it. [CLAP]

00:27:10.165 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:90%
The bear is in front of me.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:90%
It's enormous.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:90%
I can smell it.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It's rank and feral.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm nervous, but I
force myself to step up

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:90%
to the bear in the vision.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And the bear wraps its arms
around me, and I think,

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm dead.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It's going to crush my ribcage.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's a gentle hug,
and we're the same size.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.238 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's so much sweeter.

00:27:27.238 --> 00:27:28.946 align:middle line:84%
And I look at the
heart center, and there

00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:84%
is something I do not
understand rationally.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:90%
It is simply so.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
There's something like an
umbilical running from my heart

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
center to the heart of
the bear, and energy

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:90%
is pumping back and forth.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And I see we are
joined at the heart.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.349 align:middle line:84%
And the bear's message
to me is, call on me,

00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show you what
you need for healing

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and what others
need to be healed.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then,
I've called on the bear.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's been an impeccable
ally in healing and protection,

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.989 align:middle line:90%
for many other people as well.

00:27:52.989 --> 00:27:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So this I need to
ask about then.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So when I was little,
I used to have

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.370 align:middle line:84%
these dreams about
this massive spider.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:84%
It was as large as
a room in a house.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And every time that would
come into the house,

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I would be cornered and in this
space with this massive spider.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Everyone else was dead.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But the spider
would telepathically

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.540 align:middle line:84%
communicate to me that
I would never be harmed.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't occur to me
until a couple weeks ago-- this

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:84%
started when I was three, maybe
four-- that maybe that spider

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:84%
hadn't killed all
those other people.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was a
form of protection.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:84%
They were dead for
some other reason.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But in something like that,
how would you interpret that?

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:39.375 align:middle line:84%
What would you have me do
with a dream like that?

00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So the dream began
when you were three years old?

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, first
of all, I think

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that the memory of that dream
is a precious bridge between you

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:84%
sitting here, Regina, and
your three-year-old self.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a bridge
across time from you

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to the life, the
fears, the thoughts,

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:84%
the challenges of your
three-year-old self.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
When kids see giant
things in dreams,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:84%
it's sometimes because kids are
physically small in relation

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:90%
to the world around them.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
That's not my
interpretation of the dream.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply saying
that when kids see

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
giant spiders or giant
humans or whatever,

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:84%
it partly reflects the fact
they are far from full grown

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and are still physically small
and vulnerable in the world.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a brilliant idea
that the spider that

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.550 align:middle line:84%
would appear so
menacing at first sight

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:84%
might be a great ally,
a tremendous ally

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:90%
available to be claimed.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I've noticed this.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Any image that
belongs to us which

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:84%
is an authentic, spontaneous
image coming to us

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
directly is a source of
healing and empowerment

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:90%
if we're ready to work with it.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I see--

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it gave
an empowering message.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.214 align:middle line:90%
You will not be harmed.

00:29:35.214 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: It gave you that
promise at that time.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think of, you know, our
protection can take many forms.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:45.054 align:middle line:84%
I mean the spider might be for
one dreamer a disease marker.

00:29:45.054 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:84%
For another dreamer, it
might be Spider Woman,

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:84%
a Native American form of the
goddess who gives the power

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to change the energy web of life
to avoid illness and to create.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
interesting because symbolism

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.620 align:middle line:90%
is very specific to us.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing about
a lot of dream books.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:90%
You open it up.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Spider, no.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've never gone
along with that.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: If I were in
favor of burning books,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:90%
I'd burn those books.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.681 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not in favor of
burning books, I hasten to add.

00:30:10.681 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want anybody to give
their power away to somebody

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:84%
telling them what
a symbol means.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:84%
We do much more than sit
around interpreting symbols.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:90%
We travel into the dreamspace.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:84%
So if I had this dream
in my mind right now

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and it had power for
me, I might consider,

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a
conscious journey.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a conscious
journey in meditation

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
or in visioning back
to my three-year-old.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to connect with her,
which could be wonderful--

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the
joy, the energy,

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.669 align:middle line:84%
the imagination of the
three-year-old self.

00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
look at the spider

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.668 align:middle line:84%
together and see what we can
do with the help of the spider

00:30:40.668 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
as protector and the one who can
help to shapeshift the energy

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:84%
web of life in the body
and all the rest of it.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.236 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
great opportunity.

00:30:47.236 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely OK.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back now.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
When you started
writing, as you said,

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.750 align:middle line:84%
you were having
these experiences

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of
parallel reality.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And so first of all, you
were breezing through school.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Your test scores
were-- You would

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.397 align:middle line:84%
dream the answers
before the test.

00:31:03.397 --> 00:31:05.855 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I used to dream the
answers to exams ahead of time.

00:31:05.855 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I once said this at a very
grand Rotary Club in Bermuda.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.252 align:middle line:84%
The Rotary in Bermuda is
full of ex-pats and Brits,

00:31:11.252 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and the British
governor was there.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.740 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I used to dream the
exam questions ahead of time,

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:10%
so I did well.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:10%
And the black Bermudan
Secretary of Education

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.390 align:middle line:10%
got up and said in her
very correct English,

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:10%
I just want to endorse
the statement by Mr. Moss.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I did very well in
school examinations

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:84%
by dreaming the questions
ahead of time too.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend to
anybody with children,

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.170 align:middle line:84%
that you would advise them to
dream the exam questions ahead

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:33.864 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:31:33.864 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is wonderful.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Well that same thing not only
carry you through school,

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:84%
but then when you decided
to begin your career

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:84%
as a writer of fiction, the
spy novels-- By the way,

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.867 align:middle line:84%
before we get any further, your
favorite two spy novels in case

00:31:47.867 --> 00:31:49.200 align:middle line:90%
we want a little summer reading.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:90%
What would you recommend for us?

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: One is
called Moscow Rules.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:52.581 align:middle line:90%
Moscow Rules in American.

00:31:52.581 --> 00:31:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And the other is called
Carnival of Spies.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:84%
They're out of print,
but you can find them.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:56.932 align:middle line:90%
You can chase them down.

00:31:56.932 --> 00:31:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Carnival of Spies.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Carnival of Spies.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: That's
probably my favorite.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.650 align:middle line:84%
It's romantic, atmospheric,
1930s, love and danger.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:03.858 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I will find a copy.

00:32:03.858 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So this was happening
in the same way.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:10.650 align:middle line:84%
The writing was flowing
through you out of some memory

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:84%
or experience from
a parallel reality?

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: No, not always.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't always
as easy as that.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.035 align:middle line:84%
However, dreams did
guide me in the plotting

00:32:18.035 --> 00:32:19.724 align:middle line:90%
and the characterization.

00:32:19.724 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you go to my novel
Moscow Rules, for example,

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.850 align:middle line:84%
there's this boozy KGB
philosopher Nikolsky.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.070 align:middle line:90%
He has a lot of dreams.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I attributed my dreams to him.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And some of the action
is my dream plot

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:90%
transferred to the characters.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So I've always used this
stuff in all my roles in life.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk
about it so nakedly

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.482 align:middle line:84%
as I do now until another
shift in my life came along.

00:32:42.482 --> 00:32:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK let's
talk about that shift,

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:47.790 align:middle line:84%
because you were doing well--
first class, big advances,

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.820 align:middle line:84%
royalties, living the high
life, young man still.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you started
having the call

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that you were supposed
to actually move deeper

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:84%
into the shaman
aspect of yourself.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:01.829 align:middle line:90%
And everything changed.

00:33:01.829 --> 00:33:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yeah.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:90%
There was something pursuing me.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.600 align:middle line:84%
In 1981 just after my first two
novels hit the New York Times

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.890 align:middle line:84%
bestseller list, I very
nearly went off to West Africa

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to be trained and initiate
as a babala kavitha

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.085 align:middle line:90%
from the Aruba tradition.

00:33:15.085 --> 00:33:18.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the links I
feel connected to,

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.374 align:middle line:84%
and the man who had
advised me on this

00:33:20.374 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
said when I told
him, "No, I'm not

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.040 align:middle line:84%
going to become an African
witch doctor in this life."

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Robert, fine.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like this.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:27.960 align:middle line:90%
The spirits are like people.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.000 align:middle line:90%
They fall in love.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll keep seeking you
under different costumes

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:84%
until you accept your full
relationship with them."

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Very prescient.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:40.074 align:middle line:84%
So in the mid-'80s, I move to
a farm in upstate New York.

00:33:40.074 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I knew no one in
the neighborhood.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:84%
I moved because of
the red-tailed hawk

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:84%
which dropped a wing
feather between my legs

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.652 align:middle line:84%
under an old, white tree
behind the farmhouse.

00:33:47.652 --> 00:33:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An oak as I recall.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: An oak, yes.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:90%
That was the clincher.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:90%
The red-tailed hawk and the oak.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And on that land, I started
dreaming very strong.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of one night, I
found myself in a lucid dream

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.184 align:middle line:84%
state, just flying around
over the landscape.

00:34:00.184 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Cool, everybody likes flying
around in their dreams.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:02.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:34:02.635 --> 00:34:03.635 align:middle line:90%
It's the best.

00:34:03.635 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: It's the best.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Best dreams.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: It's just absolute fun.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I feel a tug
of someone's intention.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I notice as I'm
flying, I seem to be

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.381 align:middle line:90%
flying on the wings of the hawk.

00:34:11.381 --> 00:34:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pulled down into a cabin
in the woods near Montreal.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's this beautiful,
older, Native American woman

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:20.889 align:middle line:84%
who's stroking a wampum belt,
a beaded belt with a she-wolf

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:24.179 align:middle line:84%
and two humans on it, and speaks
to me in a musical cadence

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:84%
language like lake
water lapping.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I understand nothing
of what she's saying.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.469 align:middle line:84%
It's not a New Age dream where
your head's inside the bubble,

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:32.070 align:middle line:90%
and you get it all at once.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:90%
I come back.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:33.469 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrilled.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:34.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.185 align:middle line:90%
I know this is for real.

00:34:35.185 --> 00:34:35.810 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:36.739 align:middle line:90%
Who the heck is she?

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for sure,
but my research begins--

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.679 align:middle line:90%
or my research deepens.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And eventually I have to
study the Mohawk language

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
and learn an archaic form of
it to communicate with her.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And I get to understand.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.990 align:middle line:84%
She's no Narandiwana,
a woman of power.

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:84%
She's Nedzedsots a dreamer,
a shaman from 300 years

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.540 align:middle line:84%
ago reaching to me
from across time,

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
from across
dimensions to bring me

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.519 align:middle line:84%
alive to certain essential
things about life, healing,

00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:00.560 align:middle line:90%
dreaming, and everything.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And the most essential is
this: dreaming is about soul.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about learning what
the soul wants in your life.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting
soul back in the body.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.205 align:middle line:84%
And the job of decent people
and a healthy community

00:35:10.205 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:84%
is to gather around each
other, encourage each other

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to tell the dream
wherever it comes from.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And honor the dream by taking
action to serve the soul

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and get the soul energy
back in the body.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.860 align:middle line:90%
So this was a huge shift.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I came to understand
in terms of past lives

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and other personalities
that she had

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:84%
tried to influence a very
colorful figure on the New York

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.730 align:middle line:84%
frontier-- a big, hard-living,
Anglo-Irishman with whom

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I have some affinity.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:84%
She had tried to
reach into his mind,

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.392 align:middle line:84%
and most certainly she
succeeded reaching into mine.

00:35:39.392 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I think she actually
has influenced

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:84%
me more than she influenced
him in her own time.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's a transtemporal,
past-life drama.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.203 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
going on right now.

00:35:48.203 --> 00:35:48.786 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And so now, you're
on the shamanic path.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:56.040 align:middle line:84%
You're taking this work, and
you're now writing nonfiction.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:90%
You begin giving workshops.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And reality starts
changing for you.

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Was it disconcerting at first?

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a field
that not many really

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.070 align:middle line:84%
had studied deeply
up to this point.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, all of us know
it's never really, really easy

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.720 align:middle line:84%
to make a huge
change in your life.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Not just a change of
job or relationship,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:84%
but a change in your whole
relationship in the world.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
at a vanity level,

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.139 align:middle line:90%
you had a wonderful life.

00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:21.347 align:middle line:84%
On the egoic level, you
already had a wonderful life.

00:36:21.347 --> 00:36:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yeah.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And you've got bills to pay,
and there's all of that.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:24.410 align:middle line:90%
There's the money.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:26.284 align:middle line:84%
There are all sort of
questions that come up.

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:28.635 align:middle line:84%
So I write very candidly
in The Boy Who Died

00:36:28.635 --> 00:36:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and Came Back about
the return journey,

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.930 align:middle line:90%
about learning certain things.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And then learning how
to live in the world,

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:84%
how to keep it together,
how to walk in this world

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.910 align:middle line:84%
with the vivid knowledge
of other worlds operating

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.940 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.006 align:middle line:84%
And I invoke the cycle
of the butterfly.

00:36:44.006 --> 00:36:45.380 align:middle line:84%
As we know the
butterfly is going

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.660 align:middle line:84%
to have to turn into a
restless stew of mush

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.860 align:middle line:84%
before it becomes
inside the chrysalis,

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:84%
before it takes on
shiny-winged life.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.422 align:middle line:84%
I talk about how my dreams
and the play of synchronicity

00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:57.380 align:middle line:90%
help me to get through.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about how
children-- my relations

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:84%
with my own children,
with other children,

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
listening to their dreams,
encouraging their imagination--

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.700 align:middle line:84%
helped me define
my way as a teacher

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and helped me to confirm
my own path in life.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a path which
there's no career track.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.430 align:middle line:90%
I call myself a dream teacher.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.050 align:middle line:84%
You can't find a
career track for that

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:16.264 align:middle line:84%
yet, though I'm trying
to create one for others.

00:37:16.264 --> 00:37:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you work with groups,

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:90%
you start noticing things.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I even notice this casually.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:84%
There will be maybe
a significant dream.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk to a
girlfriend or two.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:84%
They just had a similar kind
of dream in that same area,

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.217 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:37:29.217 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
start looking at what

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.050 align:middle line:84%
you may be dreaming as a soul
family or even as a society.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about this
in my last interview

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:39.500 align:middle line:84%
with you quite a bit,
but maybe just touch

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.610 align:middle line:90%
on some of what you see.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the
Eastern Bloc countries

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:84%
where you teach a lot now
and you have for years.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Talk a little bit
about what happens

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:84%
when you're dreaming
together as society.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I've been
gaining a great deal

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.320 align:middle line:84%
from teaching a lot in
East European countries

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that have suffered the tragedy
of being stuck between Germany

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.076 align:middle line:84%
and Russia and overrun
by both of them

00:38:01.076 --> 00:38:02.825 align:middle line:84%
recurringly throughout
their history, what

00:38:02.825 --> 00:38:04.930 align:middle line:84%
with the traumatic
World War II history

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and a traumatic
continuing situation.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I love going there and
teaching whole groups of people

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
how to do healing
with the ancestors.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.184 align:middle line:84%
How to do cultural
soul recovery.

00:38:14.184 --> 00:38:16.350 align:middle line:84%
How to connect with authentic
traditions of the land

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:90%
that are important to them.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.220 align:middle line:90%
We'll do conscious streaming.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.470 align:middle line:90%
We'll have a circle of people.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:22.553 align:middle line:84%
We're using shamanic
drumming, and our intention--

00:38:22.553 --> 00:38:25.020 align:middle line:84%
for example-- is to access
the ancestors of the families

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.140 align:middle line:84%
of the land and effect
healing with them.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Our intention might
be to go and find

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.810 align:middle line:84%
a connection with an
ancient wisdom bearer

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.190 align:middle line:84%
from the goddess tradition
of the Baltic, for example.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And the results have
been phenomenal.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.240 align:middle line:90%
This is deep work.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It's collective work as
well as individual work,

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and something for which I feel
a very, very strong calling.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes I remember.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And anybody can watch one
of our other interviews,

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and you went into
great detail on some

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.050 align:middle line:90%
of what happened in those.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.152 align:middle line:84%
But as you're
talking about this,

00:38:52.152 --> 00:38:54.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I find
interesting is in your book,

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
you talked about the
notion of the danger

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:90%
of knowing our other selves.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Our other lives are too
much, knowing too much.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Why is that a danger?

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, the trick
is to remember things

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:84%
from other lives without
being oppressed by them.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Without buying into some
story of linear karma,

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, which
crushes you, making

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:84%
you think that you're guilty
and carrying the burden

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.440 align:middle line:84%
or carrying the repetitive
pattern of things from the past

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and have no violation, no
free will to change it.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Another danger is of just
being completely overwhelmed

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and absorbed in a drama from
another time in a way that

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:84%
makes you incapable
of operating freely

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and consciously in
your present time.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.920 align:middle line:84%
For a time, quite frankly, when
I met Sir William Johnson--

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.961 align:middle line:84%
that was his name, the
Anglo-Irishman-- an island

00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:40.680 align:middle line:84%
woman, the Mohawk
shaman, clan mother,

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I was in danger of living
their dramas in my own time

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and forgetting that
I had an obligation

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
to be present to my own
time and fully of it.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I was beginning to live
an 18th-century story

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:90%
in the late 20th century.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
That's an interesting tale,
but it's not satisfactory.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.400 align:middle line:84%
We must live in our
own time and recognize

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that the only
fundamental time is now.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.654 align:middle line:84%
It's our-- it's
a point of power.

00:40:01.654 --> 00:40:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we're connected
to that or to something

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.740 align:middle line:84%
from the future, we should
operate in this moment of time

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.370 align:middle line:84%
to maximize on the
creative possibilities

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:90%
of these connections.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:90%
We talk about the past.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I also personally feel
responsible and connected

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to a priestess scientist who
lives about three centuries

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.640 align:middle line:84%
from now and is trying
to repair this world.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that my work is
possibly making a contribution

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.320 align:middle line:84%
to what she and her
order of sisters

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:84%
will be able to do three
centuries in the future.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about the burdens

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:90%
or the challenges of the past.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.214 align:middle line:84%
It's about our obligations
to those who come after us.

00:40:33.214 --> 00:40:34.880 align:middle line:84%
One of things I learned
from the Mohawk,

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.432 align:middle line:84%
from the Six Nations
of the Iroquois,

00:40:37.432 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:84%
is that we must think about
the consequences of everything,

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:84%
down to seven generations
beyond ourselves.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Now I sometimes forget that
humans are forgetful animals.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But she, the woman from
the future, will remind me.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.140 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.982 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
when, for example,

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:84%
the woman of the
future, you're talking--

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:54.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking space now.

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:58.630 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we're dreaming
of being in other lands,

00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and repeatedly?

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And is that
preparing us possibly

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:84%
then for a movement
to another land

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to introduce ourselves
to another soul tribe?

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.770 align:middle line:84%
How does that movement
work in dream time?

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I
think it's like this.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.514 align:middle line:84%
In dreaming-- whether
it's spontaneous night

00:41:13.514 --> 00:41:16.055 align:middle line:84%
dreams or shamanic journeying
or a certain kind of meditation

00:41:16.055 --> 00:41:18.380 align:middle line:84%
or lucid dreaming or
that in-between state

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.090 align:middle line:84%
of hypnagogia-- in
dreaming, we get out there.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.810 align:middle line:84%
We go beyond the rules
of physical reality.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:90%
We go beyond body and brain.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.910 align:middle line:84%
We go through the curtain walls
of our ordinary understanding.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:90%
We go into different realities.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:84%
We go into parallel times,
past times, future times.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:84%
We go into places where
the dead are at home.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.060 align:middle line:84%
We go into places of
healing and initiation

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and training and pleasure
in other realities.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:90%
And they're real.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.310 align:middle line:90%
We go to other realities.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.726 align:middle line:84%
I mean, physics
tells us there are

00:41:43.726 --> 00:41:45.340 align:middle line:90%
realities beyond the physical.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a way of
traveling, effortlessly,

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.060 align:middle line:90%
into those other realms.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And then when you start
recognizing what's

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.845 align:middle line:84%
going on every night
in your sleep dreams,

00:41:52.845 --> 00:41:55.200 align:middle line:84%
you can house the images
that have some potential.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can learn
to go consciously

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:84%
through the doorways
of what you remember

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.340 align:middle line:84%
from your spontaneous
experiences

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and become a conscious,
multi-dimensional traveler.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.942 align:middle line:84%
Which is what I encourage
people to be and to do.

00:42:05.942 --> 00:42:06.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a great adventure.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.090 align:middle line:90%
It's limitless.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
pay for plane tickets

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.630 align:middle line:90%
or wait for your bags.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But sometimes you
need to move your body too.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And I always find
that interesting.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:16.380 align:middle line:84%
When something leads you to
leave your tribe of people,

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.200 align:middle line:84%
where your DNA may have been
planted over and over again,

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and to break free
and go to a new area

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and start inculcating that new
DNA into your soul for future

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.600 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:84%
There was this one-- it just
triggered the memory of it,

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.900 align:middle line:90%
talking about practicing.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:90%
I had a friend.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:36.660 align:middle line:90%
She's a deep dreamer.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.842 align:middle line:84%
And we went to Sedona
on a little trip.

00:42:40.842 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time
I had ever been

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.494 align:middle line:84%
to Sedona, but with this wild
shaman guy who just showed up

00:42:46.494 --> 00:42:47.660 align:middle line:90%
in our lives and said, come.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.840 align:middle line:90%
And we said, OK.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So we went, and we were
staying at her son's house.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.190 align:middle line:90%
And there were six of us.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And he's a very hospitable
man, so we crashed on the floor

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.190 align:middle line:84%
in sleeping bags
and all of this.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And the wild and
crazy shaman was

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.070 align:middle line:90%
taking advantage of hospitality.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And so Linda, my friend,
said to the host, her son,

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:10.230 align:middle line:90%
I am so sorry.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I did
this to you again.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Why do I keep doing this to you?

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what do you mean,
why do you keep doing this?

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.740 align:middle line:84%
It turned out, we
found out over time,

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.600 align:middle line:84%
she had never done
that to him before.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But the lucid dreaming--
what we were told later,

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.730 align:middle line:84%
we had practiced
this trip, that was

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:84%
going to be very
important for our futures,

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.680 align:middle line:84%
over and over in dream time with
the same cast of characters.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So she truly felt
she had already

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:41.050 align:middle line:84%
done this disturbing thing and
been a burden upon her son.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:44.150 align:middle line:84%
When she finally found,
no that was a dream

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.800 align:middle line:90%
you've been practicing together.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was ultimately
how I moved to Sedona--

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.060 align:middle line:84%
was because we
did come together.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.340 align:middle line:90%
We did go to that space.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:84%
That crazy shaman did take us
to places that in a meditation,

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I later recognized
and moved there.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So was she able to avoid
the things she was apologizing

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.400 align:middle line:90%
for in waking reality?

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And did the rehearsal enable
her to do something differently

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:04.930 align:middle line:84%
when it came to
the physical event?

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think when she
realized it was only a dream,

00:44:07.755 --> 00:44:09.990 align:middle line:84%
she didn't feel quite as
guilty for having burdened

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:13.020 align:middle line:84%
them only one time instead
of upon numerous occasions.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.214 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't do it again.

00:44:14.214 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: But let's just talk
about this aspect of dreaming.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Dreaming shows us challenges and
opportunities that lie ahead.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.120 align:middle line:84%
It enables us, in the
process of rehearsing,

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:84%
to get ready to
make better choices

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.210 align:middle line:90%
and avoid things we don't like.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:26.730 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was looking at.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you can see
it, you might be

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.570 align:middle line:84%
able to do something to
change it for the better.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And whether you see
it through intuition

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:84%
or whether you see
it through dreaming,

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:34.300 align:middle line:84%
if you could see the
future, you might

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.841 align:middle line:84%
be able to change
it for the better--

00:44:35.841 --> 00:44:38.077 align:middle line:84%
even if it's an event
that is intractable.

00:44:38.077 --> 00:44:39.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't stop the
eruption of that volcano.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.560 align:middle line:84%
You can't stop a death that's
a result of a certain life.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:84%
You can be prepared for
it, so that when it comes,

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.200 align:middle line:90%
you are ready.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's a survival
function of dreaming,

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.575 align:middle line:84%
which most of our
ancestors have understood

00:44:50.575 --> 00:44:52.755 align:middle line:84%
but which the modern West,
and dream psychologists

00:44:52.755 --> 00:44:55.047 align:middle line:84%
in the West, still have great
difficulty understanding.

00:44:55.047 --> 00:44:56.796 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
goes on in dreaming

00:44:56.796 --> 00:44:58.290 align:middle line:90%
is we go ahead of ourselves.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.110 align:middle line:84%
We walk the roads of
this life and look

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:01.530 align:middle line:90%
at the potholes, craters--

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
call practicing, rehearsing.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.445 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: --and the opportunity.

00:45:05.445 --> 00:45:06.567 align:middle line:90%
And then we can use it.

00:45:06.567 --> 00:45:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:08.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's very important.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't often look
at it that way.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about Tinkerbell, the
place between wake and sleep.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.530 align:middle line:90%
You write about it in your book.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: This is the gift of
the Disney scriptwriters.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:19.651 align:middle line:84%
It's actually not in
JM Barrie's Peter Pan.

00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But Disney does some good
stuff from time to time.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I give them full
credit for this.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:27.340 align:middle line:84%
When Peter Pan is sad because
his fairy friend is going away,

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Tink says to him, "Look for
me in the place between sleep

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:31.950 align:middle line:90%
and awake.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:34.700 align:middle line:90%
There you will always find me."

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:38.049 align:middle line:84%
This is profound and beautiful
counsel for all of us

00:45:38.049 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:84%
who are interested in
expanding our consciousness

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and learning more about
the larger reality.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:47.060 align:middle line:84%
This space between sleep
and waking-- wake dream,

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.580 align:middle line:84%
in between-- it's
an incredible space

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.619 align:middle line:90%
for creative problem solving.

00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible
space for becoming

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.680 align:middle line:84%
more psychically or
intuitively alive.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a space for
meeting the inner guide,

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:90%
the inner voice you can trust.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a launch pad
for lucid dreaming,

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.066 align:middle line:84%
because the images
that rise and fall

00:46:03.066 --> 00:46:04.440 align:middle line:84%
when you're in
that drifty state.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.130 align:middle line:84%
You're not quite asleep
or you're not fully awake.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:08.380 align:middle line:90%
You're drifting in between.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Images rise and fall, and you
can choose to take one of them

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and stay with it and go off
on a lucid dream adventure.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.620 align:middle line:84%
In my books-- and
particularly in the new one,

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.650 align:middle line:84%
the thriller memoir
that I've written--

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:84%
there are lots and
lots of narratives

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.410 align:middle line:84%
of what becomes
possible in that state.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I would say that this is
arguably the most interesting

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.390 align:middle line:90%
state of expanded consciousness.

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:32.470 align:middle line:84%
It's available to us
on an everyday basis.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
always get frustrated

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.720 align:middle line:84%
when I've had an amazing
experience in that place

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.020 align:middle line:84%
between, which
happens all the time.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.462 align:middle line:84%
But I snap myself
back so quickly.

00:46:44.462 --> 00:46:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Of course I'm living
a different reality,

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and within-- of course--
a second it's gone.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.000 align:middle line:84%
How do we stop
ourself from the loss

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.400 align:middle line:84%
of memory of these
amazing experiences?

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, the short answer
is always the same-- practice,

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.730 align:middle line:90%
practice, practice.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:57.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean this--

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's not
a state you can control.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.060 align:middle line:84%
How do you practice in a
state you have, in one sense,

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.850 align:middle line:84%
not a lot of conscious
control over?

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:06.225 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: We don't
want to control.

00:47:06.225 --> 00:47:07.510 align:middle line:90%
We want to navigate.

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:10.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason I didn't
like the term "lucid

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:90%
dreaming" some years ago.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.117 align:middle line:84%
Control and manipulate
your dreams.

00:47:14.117 --> 00:47:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't want to do that.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:17.085 align:middle line:84%
The dream world is
wiser and vaster

00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:18.418 align:middle line:90%
than the ordinary consciousness.

00:47:18.418 --> 00:47:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you put
a message in before?

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:20.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.070 align:middle line:90%
You're in this wonderful state.

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.736 align:middle line:84%
You're having this
wonderful experience.

00:47:23.736 --> 00:47:27.430 align:middle line:84%
How do you bring it back
with you, consciously?

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, there are
two great questions here.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The first is how do
you sustain that state.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And the second is how
do you bring it back.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer to both
is the same- practice,

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.240 align:middle line:90%
practice, practice.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But let's go to the how
do you bring it back.

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, you want to
write something down.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:42.600 align:middle line:90%
You want to record something.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Our memories are short.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.280 align:middle line:84%
We delude ourselves
into thinking

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.900 align:middle line:84%
we're going to remember a lot
unless we record something.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
good at this, you

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.230 align:middle line:84%
want to get more
practice at dream recall

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.750 align:middle line:84%
or bringing back the memories
of the place between sleep

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.885 align:middle line:84%
and awake, get in the
habit of keeping a journal

00:47:55.885 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:90%
and writing something down.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.051 align:middle line:90%
You don't have very much?

00:47:58.051 --> 00:47:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, write something
down anyway.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.293 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of saying to
the part of yourself that

00:48:02.293 --> 00:48:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is the traveler,
that is the dreamer,

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to honor you.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep
a record of it.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of feeding
the idea that you're

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:10.039 align:middle line:90%
willing to remember.

00:48:10.039 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:11.850 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you just set a
subconscious program there.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:14.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Before we wrap up
our conversation,

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:20.460 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking off camera,
we were talking about a word

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.320 align:middle line:90%
that no one ever hears.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.101 align:middle line:90%
"Amnanesus?"

00:48:23.101 --> 00:48:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Anamnesis.

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An-num-knee-sis.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.571 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: When I was a
teenager in Australia,

00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:29.170 align:middle line:84%
one of my invisible companions--
invisible to other people

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:31.439 align:middle line:84%
but not to me-- was a
radiant, beautiful, young man.

00:48:31.439 --> 00:48:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I would say from the eastern
edge of the Mediterranean,

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:34.920 align:middle line:90%
somewhere like that.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Ionia.

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Who would speak to me in Greek.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Dreams can set us
research assignments.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.860 align:middle line:84%
My Greek has never
been very good,

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:44.770 align:middle line:84%
but I'd have to
keep a dictionary.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:46.270 align:middle line:10%
And he told me, as
I understood him,

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:middle line:10%
that all knowledge
that is important

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.965 align:middle line:10%
comes through anamnesis.

00:48:49.965 --> 00:48:51.840 align:middle line:10%
You'll find the word in
English dictionaries.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:52.923 align:middle line:10%
It's not a household word.

00:48:52.923 --> 00:48:55.000 align:middle line:10%
It means, literally,
remembering.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:10%
But he's talking out
of the philosophy

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.940 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient Greeks.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the philosophy of
the neo-Platonist school,

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.532 align:middle line:90%
anamnesis is soul remembering.

00:49:03.532 --> 00:49:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It's remembering
the knowledge that

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:08.230 align:middle line:84%
belongs to you on the level
of soul, spirit, naos,

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.830 align:middle line:84%
mind-- before you
come into the body.

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.890 align:middle line:84%
In the doctrine of
the Pythagoreans,

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:15.770 align:middle line:84%
anamnesis is the
recollection of past lives

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and other lives to
which you're connected

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
communicate across time

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:23.560 align:middle line:84%
with those personalities
in their own time.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.510 align:middle line:84%
As a neo-Platonist
philosopher Proculus

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:28.610 align:middle line:84%
believed he was
communicating with Plutarch,

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the priest of Apollo
and biographer,

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.110 align:middle line:90%
in nightly dialogues.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:33.180 align:middle line:90%
I recommend this.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I recommend trying to
converse across time

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.560 align:middle line:84%
with those personalities you
feel connected to, seeing

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.440 align:middle line:84%
whether you can borrow gifts
and lessons from each other.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so for
you, the greatest benefit

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:49.070 align:middle line:84%
in having remembered a fair
amount of your soul's journey?

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I feel that I'm
living a pretty exciting story.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It's more interesting than the
story of up-and-down dramas,

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:84%
though I pay close
attention to the bumps

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and grinds of everyday life.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I live by synchronicity.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.510 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:01.009 align:middle line:84%
There is a sense
of a mythic drama.

00:50:01.009 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you have that
sense of mythic drama,

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.570 align:middle line:84%
it does give you
courage and sometimes

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:07.510 align:middle line:84%
clarity to get through
the other stuff in life.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a final comment
on dreams, our dreaming life

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and why we need to embrace
that and give it some credence.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Because it's going
to be your way of finding

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.090 align:middle line:90%
your bigger and braver story.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:23.850 align:middle line:10%
The Australian Aborigines
say the big stories

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:26.170 align:middle line:10%
are hunting the right
people to tell them.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:10%
Now I would say to live them.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.290 align:middle line:10%
How do you get in touch
with your bigger story

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:32.220 align:middle line:10%
to give you that
courage and energy?

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Dreaming is one of the ways.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Robert.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I love the book.

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:90%
What did you call it?

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.207 align:middle line:90%
A personal thriller?

00:50:40.207 --> 00:50:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yes, I did
call it a thriller.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:44.197 align:middle line:84%
It is something of a thriller,
a metaphysical thriller.

00:50:44.197 --> 00:50:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meanwhile,
I think I'm going

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.224 align:middle line:84%
to pick up Carnival of
Spies as a summer read.

00:50:49.224 --> 00:50:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Good luck.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:51.176 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:50:51.176 --> 00:50:51.895 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:50:51.895 --> 00:50:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Our pleasure.

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:53.940 align:middle line:84%
