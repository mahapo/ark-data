>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Have you begun

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.370 align:middle line:84%
smelling something fishy when
you read that roughly half

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.160 align:middle line:84%
of the kids in school in
the US are being drugged

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.140 align:middle line:84%
for some kind of
mood or personality

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:90%
disorder or another?

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're among millions
of people beginning to wake up

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:84%
to what amounts to
a medical conspiracy

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:90%
of gigantic proportions.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Investigative
reporter Jon Rappoport

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
says that the plan
is simple: we're

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
put onto drugs from the
cradle to the grave.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And part of the successful
implementation of that plan

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:90%
is to see that we are compliant.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JON RAPPOPORT: Yeah.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.103 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Taking a lot of drugs.

00:00:42.103 --> 00:00:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Entire nations are being
drugged at this time

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.855 align:middle line:84%
so that we can remain
compliant, would you say?

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: That's
what I've concluded

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
after looking into
this for 30 years,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:90%
that that's exactly the program.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
People need to
understand, first of all,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that these drugs that
the kids are put on,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
they're not diagnosed
with anything

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:90%
that's actually tested.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:90%
For example, ADHD.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:90%
People say, well, ADHD.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
We have now five million
kids in the United States.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't have anything.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
What we have is a
conspiracy to produce

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
a definition of a so-called
mental disorder that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
has no chemical or
biological test of any kind

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:90%
to diagnose it.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It's all done by a
menu of behaviors

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
such that almost anybody
could be diagnosed with ADHD,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:90%
and they are.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:90%
And then they're drugged.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.739 align:middle line:90%
And these drugs are dangerous.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And along that path there is
the new-- what is it called?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.102 align:middle line:90%
The DMS, I think--

00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: DSM.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The DSM.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The new DSM is supposed
to be coming out.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Please explain to people what
the DSM is, why it's important,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen when the
new, improved, and upgraded one

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
comes out, what this
means to our lives

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.671 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the world of mental
health, which many people are

00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
having to interface
with in their families.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: DSM, Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Is the Bible of the American
Psychiatric Association

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that lists all official
mental disorders that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
are defined by committees
that are set up

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of psychiatrists to sit
around and say, hmm,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:84%
shall we widen the
definition of bipolar?

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Shall we try to make it thinner?

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
They're not talking
about chemical tests,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
biological tests,
any kind of test.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
They're talking
about-- I don't know.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
arbitrary definitions.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
There are 297 now of these
official mental disorders.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.044 align:middle line:90%
It's billable, you see?

00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.126 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Let's
get down to it.

00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
A psychiatrist can say, well,
I diagnosed a patient with,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
oh, let's see here, oppositional
defiance disorder, type 2ZQVR.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget to bill on-- yes.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:90%
And then they get paid.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe the kid just
has a rebellious nature, right?

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Just has
a rebellious nature,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
he's allergic to something
coming in the window

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and it gets him upset.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
He's eating GMO corn and
it's making him crazy.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.874 align:middle line:90%
You know, it could be anything.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Could be
absolutely anything.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nobody
has a diagnosis.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.896 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?

00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Then
come the drugs.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The drugs are specific
to the diagnosis.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So for, say, bipolar, we get
Lithium, we get Valproate.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Now these are extremely heavy
drugs, especially for kids.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are life
threatening problems

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
connected with
these drugs to give.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So here are the psychiatrists
wending their merry way

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
through life, making
these diagnoses.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And the DSM is the foundation.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the Bible.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that quote,
everybody can refer to to say,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.956 align:middle line:84%
we know this exists
because it's in the DSM.

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.370 align:middle line:90%
We've defined it.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:90%
It has a label.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It has drugs that
go along with it.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We get paid for
diagnosing it this way.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And so there's all
these people out there,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
millions and millions of
Americans, that are duped.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Complete.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.369 align:middle line:90%
Their complete dupes.

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what their
level of education,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if they have no
education or they have PhDs

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and they think they're the most
brilliant people in the world.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
None of these 297
official mental disorders

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.212 align:middle line:84%
has ever had a diagnostic test
of any kind to make it real.

00:04:52.212 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
from the beginning.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Schizophrenia all the
way up to-- whatever

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
you want-- the latest and
greatest expansion of bipolar

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So in 2013, we're going to have
the fifth edition of the DSM,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:90%
probably in the late spring.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It's going to include
more disorders.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.395 align:middle line:90%
New disorders.

00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, they have
to make this stuff up now.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.170 align:middle line:84%
They have to be just
making this stuff up.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: They always did.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:90%
They are now.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And they'll continue to do it.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But of course they
don't see it that way.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.295 align:middle line:90%
Except I've got the quotes.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Give us a couple.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Russell Barkley.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Very famous psychiatrist,
neurology professor,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Massachusetts.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Impeccable credentials.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
PBS FRONTLINE, the show was,
"Does ADHD Really Exist?"

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So the questioner
says to him, well,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
people say it
doesn't really exist

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
because there isn't
any real test.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.587 align:middle line:90%
There's no blood test.

00:05:52.587 --> 00:05:53.545 align:middle line:90%
There's no saliva test.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:90%
There's no any kind of test.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh dear.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh dear.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
If we needed-- you
don't understand

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
science, my good fellow,
how it really operates.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:84%
If we needed a test for every
one of these mental disorders,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
mental disorders

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
because we have no
tests for any of them.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
you see how absurd

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:84%
it is to say that we're
unscientific, because how could

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.614 align:middle line:84%
we publish a Bible called
the DSM with 297 of these

00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:90%
when they don't exist?

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's all circular reasoning.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.623 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That sounds like
something out of "Alice

00:06:32.623 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:90%
In Wonderland."

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Well,
everything about this

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.939 align:middle line:84%
is straight out of Alice
in Wonderland, you see.

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, I
know a guy who's crazy.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We all know people
that are nuts.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying that they're
not nuts, that's not true.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:90%
They are nuts.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And people fail to recognize
the difference between saying

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.287 align:middle line:84%
somebody's off,
somebody's crazy.

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't know what they're doing.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.744 align:middle line:90%
They're flipping their lid.

00:06:55.744 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:84%
All the kinds of
phrases that we use

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
for people-- he's
not feeling good.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:90%
He's lousy.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know where-- he's
at float at sea in his life.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
He has severe problems,
blah, blah, blah.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
All of that colloquial
conversation, that's one thing.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, people suffer.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:90%
They have problems.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Serious things go wrong.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
actually nutritional.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is paranoia,
and schizophrenia does exist.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:90%
All of it exists.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: It exists in
common colloquial language, OK?

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:90%
To say somebody's paranoid, OK.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And one could, in any given
case, one could say, well, hey.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We fixed this guy up
nutritionally, and guess what?

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have the
problem anymore.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Or guess what?

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:90%
He had some severe allergies.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Or guess what?

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:84%
This guy really
does have problems

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:90%
and he doesn't know what to do.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:90%
And we're trying to help him.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Hey, that's real too.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:90%
But now to say, hmm.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
We want to fit you into
these labels, 297 of them,

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and we have drugs
for all of them.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And they all have
severe adverse effects.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of them will
get you new diagnoses

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
of new mental
disorders because we're

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.500 align:middle line:84%
going to interpret those effects
of the drugs as new disorders.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.567 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to drug you more.

00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So again, we
have some backward thinking

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:90%
going on there.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:84%
They back into a diagnosis
based on the fact

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.939 align:middle line:84%
that they've already
created the drug.

00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: OK, now
that's the next thing.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
With Prozac, they
discovered that it

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:90%
changed serotonin levels.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:90%
So they said, OK.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
It increases the
amount of serotonin.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Therefore let's
define depression

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:90%
as a deficit of serotonin.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Backwards.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Totally background.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.410 align:middle line:84%
As we discussed off camera,
sort of like saying,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
well, the reason you have
the flu, my good man,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a
deficit of Tamiflu.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vaccine.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.901 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: And we're
going to remedy that

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:90%
by giving you the drug.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you won't
have the flu anymore.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:90%
And you go, what causes the flu?

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:90%
A deficit of Tamiflu.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Some serious research
has gone into this.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's like
the same with Prozac.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:84%
They define these
things backwards.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
They find a drug, they
see what the drug does,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and then they define
the condition.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
pseudoscience psychiatry

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that has been making
it up all along,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and they're finally
now getting exposed.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm one of the people
who has been, I have to say,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:84%
relentless over the
last 10 or 15 years

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
in doing this because I
see what it does to people.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
They get a diagnosis.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.139 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there's the
effect of thinking, OK,

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I have a mental disorder.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Now the stigma is removed.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Hillary Clinton waved her wand
and now there's no more stigma.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And everybody accepts the idea
that this is just like diabetes

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But the person has
a diagnosis, OK?

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Now everything is
about struggling

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in their life to
regain normalcy.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
The ceiling has been lowered.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And now everybody's
in treatment.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's trying to regain
a sense of balance in life

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and whatever instead of
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:90%
This person has problems, yes.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out what's going
on in the case of that person.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:84%
This is not some
collectivist-- or shouldn't

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
be-- situation where we say,
oh, symptom one, two, three,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:90%
four fixed.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:90%
He's got this one.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:90%
We bill for it.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Give him the drugs.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Next, come in.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
You've got-- that
is mass diagnosis.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
That's not looking
at the human being.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And the effects of the drugs
are absolutely devastating.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people on the so-called
neuroleptics like Haldol

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
others, Stelazine.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.362 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What do those do?

00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:49.695 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Motor brain damage.

00:10:49.695 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:90%
It's called tardive dyskinesia.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:90%
It's basically motor.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:90%
You know, tremors and twitches.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is used
for epilepsy and-- what

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.762 align:middle line:90%
is it used for?

00:10:57.762 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT:
Originally it was used

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
for people who were supposedly
severe schizophrenics.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:90%
In other words, psychotics.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:04.881 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:08.399 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Now it's being
used on kids, young kids.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For what?

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT:
Risperdal, for example.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Bipolar.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Sneaking it in the door.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Here's a playbook for you.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And people out there, some
of them will be able to say,

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.481 align:middle line:90%
this happened to me.

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Kid's sitting in school.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:90%
He's fidgeting, he's bored.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.763 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:11:24.763 --> 00:11:25.513 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:11:25.513 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For good
reason in most cases.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.108 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Bored, whatever.

00:11:28.108 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Doctor.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.062 align:middle line:84%
You got these-- you
do this, you do that.

00:11:32.062 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you kicked your leg out.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:90%
You look out the window.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:34.635 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:34.635 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:90%
ADHD.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Ritalin.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.874 align:middle line:90%
That's speed.

00:11:37.874 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: So immediately
this cheap form of speed

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
makes the kid able to
concentrate for the first

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe few days, few
weeks, whatever it is.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Differs.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Then if he keeps taking it,
goes into a speed crash.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Could be sudden, could
be gradual, but down.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Fatigue, out of it.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Mother takes him back
to the psychiatrist.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now we're seeing the
emergence of a new condition.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.142 align:middle line:90%
Clinical depression.

00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:84%
That have anything to do
with the drug, doctor?

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Ritalin?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:90%
No, completely new condition.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.532 align:middle line:90%
Prozac.

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Gives kid Prozac.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Causes mania,
among other things.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:90%
Woo, whoa.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So now the kid is
bouncing off the walls.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:84%
He's taking Ritalin,
he's taking Prozac.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's going up and down
and in and out and whenever.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Back to the doctor again.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, more precise
definition in what's

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:84%
wrong with your child
is bipolar disease,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:84%
otherwise we used to know as
manic depression, up and down.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we start to give you
Valproate, Lithium, and so on.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:90%
This is chemical warfare, right?

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, now that at this point
the doctor can and does

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
sometimes slip in Risperdal,
an anti-psychotic.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So now you could get a kid
who's just fidgeting in school

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and say two years
later, whatever,

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:90%
he's got brain damage.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Motor brain damage.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Permanent motor brain
damage from Risperdal.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:90%
So now his life is destroyed.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But now the shrinks, of
course, they can't admit this.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
They know these effects exist
but they won't admit it.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:90%
So now, oh no.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It's the mental illness.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.718 align:middle line:90%
It's the disease.

00:13:08.718 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry to tell the parents.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing rapid deterioration
these days and more and more

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.467 align:middle line:84%
of these cases of so and so and
bipolar and blah, blah, blah,

00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:90%
blah.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They're destroying
kids' brains with drugs

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.730 align:middle line:84%
on basis of diagnoses
that have no proof.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's start with
where the problem often begins.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.339 align:middle line:90%
In school, right?

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Right.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A teacher is not
appreciative of the way

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
someone may be
behaving in class.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe someone is being
very disruptive in class,

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.802 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:13:39.802 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:90%
How does it start from there?

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:90%
What is the teacher interface?

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:84%
They can't diagnose anything,
but there is a very big teacher

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
component of this when
it comes to the kids.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: People are guided.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:84%
They learn through little
weekend seminars and memos

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and training to look
for signs of, you see,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and in this case, ADHD, and
to make recommendations.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So the kid is first sent
to the school counselor.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Disruptive kid.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.593 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you see the counselor?

00:14:11.593 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Counselor says, sit down.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And bah, bah, bah, bah, and
they have a little conversation.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Counselor, need to bring
their parents in here

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.302 align:middle line:84%
and we have a recommendation
to see the child psychiatrist.

00:14:24.302 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like a funnel.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the same
problem the teachers

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:90%
have run into forever.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:84%
What do you do with a kid
who's messing things up

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
or who doesn't respond
for whatever reason?

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, there could be millions
of different causes for that,

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:90%
including the teacher.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:90%
But it's the culture.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Starting-- let's call it 1960s--
there was a much greater push

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of these
behaviors as a teacher

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
because they could be a
sign of ADHD, you see?

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And all the teachers
kind of go, oh.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.910 align:middle line:90%
A mental disorder.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.702 align:middle line:90%
Who knew, you know?

00:15:06.702 --> 00:15:10.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't question this
kind of thing, right?

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Dull.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Dull.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, who says
this is a mental disorder?

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Who says this kid who's drawing
great pictures in class,

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
my class, who doesn't seem
to care about geography

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, seems to
have a talent here?

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
When is a teacher
going to say that?

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And now they want
to shuck him off

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
into something that involves
a diagnosis and drugs?

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.977 align:middle line:84%
Teacher's not going
to make these waves.

00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they're not.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And so really it almost
becomes, at this point,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:84%
a war on independent
thinking, a war on creativity.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
A war on any kind of
expression of energy

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that is not conventional
in the way the teacher

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:84%
needs a child to respond, like
a little robot, automaton,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:84%
soldier, whatever
you want to call it.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I obviously have a bone about
some of the educational system

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But once we start being
herded down that chute

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and you have half of the kids
in the nation on drugs, what's

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:90%
the automatic extension of that?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Sure.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
If Nikola Tesla, Einstein,
and people like that

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.930 align:middle line:84%
were going to school
today, Royal Rife,

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:90%
they'd be loaded up with drugs.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:90%
They'd all be drugged.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Now the question would only
be, could they overcome it?

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's a good chance
that they wouldn't be able to.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:90%
This is chemical warfare.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying, talent,
talent, talent, drug it.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:84%
That's when we get naked about
this, what's really going on.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
much larger agenda.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: That is.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Now it's true.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
There is a class of kids,
a whole lot of kids,

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
whose behavior in
classrooms is caused

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
by things like junk
food, severe nutrition

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
deficiencies,
allergies and so forth.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Blood sugar
imbalances among other things

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.205 align:middle line:90%
like your wife talks about.

00:17:04.205 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Exactly.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.099 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to do great
nutrition with these kids,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:90%
they bounce back.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like, whoa, boy, I'm back.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I'm alive, you know?

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:90%
That's one big situation.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:84%
But the other big situation
we're dealing with is-- no.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Kids who-- they're
interested in things

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that don't have to do
with the classroom.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: And some of
those kids have major talents.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.905 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to drug
that talent into oblivion.

00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the
destruction of society.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to get a historical
perspective on this.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned Royal
Raymond Rife a moment ago.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
In his day, I mean,
everyone-- people

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
that are familiar with him will
remember the famous picture

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
where he's in his tuxedo along
with a number of other MDs,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and they had announced that
this was the end of cancer.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They had been able, through
his frequency device,

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.177 align:middle line:90%
to cure cancer.

00:18:06.177 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:90%
And they were.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
They were doing it in hospitals
and clinics, all over.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.722 align:middle line:90%
This was 80 years ago, right?

00:18:12.722 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:90%
70, 80 years ago.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:14.221 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Right.

00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now of
course Rockefeller,

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:22.190 align:middle line:84%
who was very much influential in
the establishing of Big Pharma,

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:90%
the Rockefeller family came in.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:90%
And he was run out of town.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Basically he was a
destroyed, broken man.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
As I recall, Royal Raymond
Rife died an alcoholic.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Right.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They killed his
technology and they killed him.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the medical side
of where that story began

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:84%
with Big Pharma's intrusion
into what were very successful,

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:84%
natural types of remedies at the
time for a myriad of diseases.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.256 align:middle line:84%
What is the equivalent
of that in psychiatry?

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Well the
equivalent, I'm afraid,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.506 align:middle line:84%
is what we're
talking about here.

00:18:54.506 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
did it start though?

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:90%
When did things start changing?

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.045 align:middle line:84%
When did Big Pharma start
reaching into this area?

00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Give us some historical context.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: OK.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:84%
We could go back an awfully long
way, but let's peg it at 1970.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:84%
1970, psychiatry is dying
as a profession in America.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Because all forms of
psychology have suddenly

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.569 align:middle line:84%
sprung up out of
nowhere in the '60s.

00:19:20.569 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
You want to try
this, you want to try

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that, you want to go to
this kind of a therapist

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and talk about
this, and so forth.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Or would you like to pay an
exorbitant amount of money

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and go see an MD psychiatrist
and sit there and talk

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
about your problems with
a guy who quite possibly

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is extraordinarily dull,
extraordinarily anal and over

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:84%
organized, and can't
give you anything?

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.487 align:middle line:84%
So fewer and fewer people were
going to see psychiatrists.

00:19:49.487 --> 00:19:50.361 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, sure.

00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the '60s was an
explosion of creativity

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and exploration,
experimentation.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
So that makes sense.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.914 align:middle line:90%
So we're setting it up now.

00:19:56.914 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: So what is
psychiatry going to do?

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:90%
The journals are failing.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The American
Psychiatric Association

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:90%
is starting to go broke.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:84%
The psychiatrists themselves
are thinking about going out

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:84%
of business or are
going out of business.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult
time for them.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.330 align:middle line:90%
But a deal was struck.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:90%
And this deal is overt.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not talking in
masked language here, you know.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Signals and so forth.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Big Pharma, big psychiatries.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Big Pharma says to
big psychiatry--

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
which is getting
smaller and looking

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:84%
more tattered-- we'll
bankroll your profession.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to bankroll
the medical journals,

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:90%
the medical conferences.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to spend all kinds
of ad dollars in your journals.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pump up the
whole profession, the training

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and schools and internships
and residencies for psychiatry.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:84%
The profession will bloom
again because of our money.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:84%
This is what we want
you to do, psychiatry.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
We want you to prove--
and if you can't prove,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
basically say you've proved--
that all mental disorders

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:84%
result from chemical
imbalances in the brain.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Talk therapy is useless.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:84%
All this other nonsense
is completely irrelevant.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.940 align:middle line:90%
All that has to be done--

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.523 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
happened literally?

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yeah.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
All that has to be done is
to correct the imbalance.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And both of us
together will promote

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
this idea, this
absurd, insane idea.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody really knows
what is the normal level

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
of functioning
chemically of the brain.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:90%
There is no baseline, you see.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
There's only oh, obviously, bad
chemical imbalance, you know?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's an
expert now, you see.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Now that the
propaganda hurricane

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:84%
has descended on the nation
for the past 40 years

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
starting in 1970, everybody
now says, oh, obviously the boy

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:90%
has a chemical imbalance.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
What'd you do, stick a needle
in his brain and measure it?

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's an expert now.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, chemical imbalance, yes.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:90%
That was the hype.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
That was the designated
PR propaganda hype

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that built this empire
of the deal, the embrace,

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:84%
between Big Pharma
and psychiatry.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:90%
And the deal continued.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You, psychiatry, you will
do the studies, the research

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that quote, prove that
one after another, you

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
have found chemical
imbalances, you say,

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in each one of these designated
mental disorders that

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.250 align:middle line:84%
has no diagnostic
test at all-- still

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a diagnostic test.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But you know it's a
chemical imbalance

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:84%
even though you
can't test for it.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And we, Big Pharma,
will produce the drugs

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to normalize the
chemical imbalance.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Paradise has arrived.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll sell the drugs.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:90%
We'll both make a fortune.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And this will be the history
of psychiatry from then on.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's happened.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the story.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were there certain
universities or institutions

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.200 align:middle line:84%
that were particularly
prominent at this time

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that started becoming research
facilities, for example?

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yeah, Harvard.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Sure, that's always
right up there.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't that somebody
went to Harvard necessarily

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:90%
and said, here's the deal.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Somebody went to any
university and said,

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:90%
here's the grant money.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.224 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of
research we want you to do.

00:23:35.224 --> 00:23:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I had the experience
of looking--

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:90%
and you've seen many of these.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.030 align:middle line:90%
I won't name the university.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But I was doing an investigative
piece on some of the practices

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:90%
they had going.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Particularly disposal of
environmentally dangerous

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.795 align:middle line:84%
substances like
radioactive things

00:23:55.795 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that were literally found
in garbage cans and such.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So I had to start digging
through some of the documents

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and started looking
at the funding

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.380 align:middle line:84%
list for the various departments
and the projects that

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:90%
were being funded.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I don't think
I found any research project

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
study that wasn't
funded by an entity that

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:90%
had a direct gain in it.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I saw any
independently funded studies.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was across
the board, a variety

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:90%
of different departments.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So in your research as an
investigative journalist,

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:90%
what have you found?

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Shall I
say it's a ditto?

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.919 align:middle line:84%
It's a ditto kind
of story and worse?

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yeah, worse.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, this
is really criminal.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.226 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Let's say I'm
a pharmaceutical company.

00:24:39.226 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Big time, OK?

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Here's my drug.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been
approved yet for use.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a billion
dollar seller if I can just

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:84%
get it approved because I've
got the PR machine in back

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:84%
of it that's going
to do that, right?

00:24:51.560 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So I fund 16 studies with
human volunteers in this drug.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:84%
13 of these studies turn out
to be a disaster for my drug.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Drug doesn't do anything.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it has adverse effects.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact, might that
be the source of those little

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.266 align:middle line:84%
disclaimers that run
across the bottom

00:25:13.266 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:90%
of each ad on television?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Maybe.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's even
worse than that.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, God.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: And so it performs
worse than a sugar pill.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:90%
You know, far worse.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:24.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So I don't publish those.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, nobody
knows about those.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You need an army to
get access to those.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's three studies
that have been manipulated

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.594 align:middle line:84%
and massaged and so
forth to look good.

00:25:39.594 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Those are the studies
that are published

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.676 align:middle line:84%
in the medical
journals, and those

00:25:42.676 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
are the studies that
are submitted to the FDA

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
so that this drug
will get approved.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And everybody gives nods
and winks and nudges,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:90%
and the drug gets approved.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, now what the other 13
studies prove pretty much

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.400 align:middle line:84%
was that this drug was
going to be a disaster.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Not only ineffective,
it was going

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to destroy people
one way or another.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.424 align:middle line:90%
Chew up the liver, whatever.

00:26:03.424 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Harmful,
harmful side effects.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:05.986 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: OK.

00:26:05.986 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So a year or two down
the line, three or four,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:90%
now we begin to get reports.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, lo and behold, there seems
to be a problem here, whatever.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And by the time the
investigation comes

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:21.125 align:middle line:84%
and the company issues
a voluntary recall

00:26:21.125 --> 00:26:24.377 align:middle line:84%
of the drug for
humanitarian purposes--

00:26:24.377 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how much
been made up to that point?

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Exactly.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.724 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: So they've
made, let's say, $6 billion

00:26:29.724 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:90%
up to that, OK?

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.359 align:middle line:84%
Now they have a slush
fund with $2.5 in it,

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and they know pretty much
that's what the fine is going

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:90%
to be that they're going to pay.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's a fine, $2.5.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:39.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.335 align:middle line:90%
Joe, write the check.

00:26:41.335 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:84%
How much profit
we got left over?

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Case closed.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.876 align:middle line:90%
Onto the next new drug.

00:26:46.876 --> 00:26:48.126 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's how it works.

00:26:48.126 --> 00:26:48.482 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yeah.

00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
it couldn't work

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
as well as it does if it
weren't for the partnership

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:90%
with the media.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.050 align:middle line:84%
The media has to be
the one to create

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.440 align:middle line:84%
our need, our
impression, and our need

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
for this particular
substance to begin with

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.204 align:middle line:84%
or we wouldn't be going
and asking for it.

00:27:04.204 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I know, granted,
sometimes we just

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.828 align:middle line:90%
take the words of the doctor.

00:27:06.828 --> 00:27:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes we'll go there
for the over the counter stuff

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:90%
all on our own and request it.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk to you
about media involvement

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.170 align:middle line:84%
in this whole story
when we come back.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.836 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
just a little break.

00:27:18.836 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:90%
We are back.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be talking about,

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
right now, about how
media is involved

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.190 align:middle line:84%
in creating the
impression that we

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:90%
need these drugs in our lives.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.570 align:middle line:90%
So you've got a story to tell.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Here's an
article that I wrote about,

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.915 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Allen Frances, one of
the most famous psychiatrists

00:27:36.915 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the DSM that
we're referring to,

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:84%
the Bible of psychiatry, he was
in charge of putting together

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:90%
the fourth edition of this.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he was over
everybody, all the committees

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:90%
and subcommittees and whatever.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So years after this
he's being interviewed

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.470 align:middle line:84%
by a reporter from
"Wired" magazine.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you know,
you can't precisely

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.140 align:middle line:90%
define a mental disorder.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.368 align:middle line:90%
It's all bleep.

00:28:08.368 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And he wrote it.

00:28:10.715 --> 00:28:13.832 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: He was in charge of
putting it all together, right?

00:28:13.832 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He said this?

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.135 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: He said this.

00:28:16.135 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
should make us all

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.801 align:middle line:90%
have pause for thought on this.

00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: OK.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:90%
And, I mean, this was the guy.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.154 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote an
article about this.

00:28:26.154 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And basically I said, is this
the biggest liar in America?

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.106 align:middle line:90%
And that was my article.

00:28:31.106 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Or I could have said, is
this the biggest hypocrite

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:90%
in America?

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So I submitted it, because
a friend said I should,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:84%
to the "Columbia
Journalism Review."

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Or Review, whatever it is.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course they publish
stories about media.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.899 align:middle line:84%
They sent it back
rejected and they said,

00:28:49.899 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:84%
the reason that we're not
really considering this

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.450 align:middle line:84%
is because this is not
a story about the media.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.780 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:84%
This was all about
a story of the media

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.380 align:middle line:84%
refusing to look
at this published

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.590 align:middle line:84%
interview with the most
famous psychiatrist in America

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
who basically destroyed
his own complete work

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.362 align:middle line:90%
on the DSM, the Bible.

00:29:12.362 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:84%
It would be like somebody
coming along and saying hey,

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I wrote the Bible,
but it's all a lie.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And now the media's
not covering it.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
"Wired" magazine covered it,
but it never went up from there

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:29.160 align:middle line:84%
into the higher echelons of
the media that suddenly cause

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:84%
scandals and congressional
hearings to happen.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And this, whoever the city
it was from the "Columbia

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.664 align:middle line:84%
Journalism Review"
said well, we only

00:29:38.664 --> 00:29:39.830 align:middle line:90%
publish stories about media.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.296 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing
to do with media.

00:29:42.296 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It has everything
to do with media.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So that leads into
the idea, yes.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:84%
The media push maybe
could be breakthroughs.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:84%
We say we're on the
verge of genetic basis

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
for this disorder is likely
to be proven in the next five

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.400 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Just around the corner is
coming further research

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.090 align:middle line:84%
that's going to make the
current generation of drugs

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.510 align:middle line:84%
for depression be superseded
by something much better.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
a cheerleading squad

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.060 align:middle line:84%
for the pharmaceutical companies
and for the psychiatrists.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's all a mirage.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, could be, we
think, next breakthrough,

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:90%
already fantastic results with.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that, scandal
drug, scandal here, there,

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.590 align:middle line:84%
but nothing tying
it all together.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:84%
What does it all mean, the
story, of that drug, this drug?

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, what about this
researcher at Cambridge

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.870 align:middle line:84%
who's suddenly come
forward and said,

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
obviously the antidepressants
are causing people

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:84%
to kill themselves
and kill other people.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.980 align:middle line:90%
This is not a myth.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.710 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So now the media sort of gets
a hold of that and they say,

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.850 align:middle line:84%
well, one psychiatrist
in England

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.590 align:middle line:84%
believes something much
darker is going on.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.290 align:middle line:90%
End of story.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: End of story.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Killed.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's
go up the family

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.060 align:middle line:90%
tree a little bit higher.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I've seen those graphs of
corporate control in the US,

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:90%
as you have.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we start looking at
some of the parent companies

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.670 align:middle line:84%
as to why there would be a
consistency in the stories

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:84%
of the media and what
the Big Pharma is doing

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and psychiatry is doing,
there's a reason for that.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean essentially,
all the power

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.349 align:middle line:84%
has been reduced to just
a handful of corporations.

00:31:27.349 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Right.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And those corporations
are intimately

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.970 align:middle line:84%
linked to Big
Pharma corporations.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't make
a move in big media

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:43.130 align:middle line:84%
without it reflecting back
to advertising dollars

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:90%
paid for by Big Pharma.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you cause ripples in
Big Pharma from big media,

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.360 align:middle line:90%
they're going to come get you.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know a guy who used
to work at a major L.A. paper

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.160 align:middle line:84%
said to me, we published a
story critical of Big Pharma.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Next day executives from one of
our pharmaceutical advertisers

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:84%
just marched into the
editorial offices,

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:84%
marched into the editor's
office, shut the door,

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:90%
read him the riot act.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Basically, you want our money?

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.650 align:middle line:90%
You shut up.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't care whether
the article's true.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:90%
We're not here for that.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.881 align:middle line:90%
It's our money.

00:32:20.881 --> 00:32:21.755 align:middle line:90%
It's our advertising.

00:32:21.755 --> 00:32:24.660 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Play ball, or we take our
money and go somewhere else.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.094 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
I brought it up

00:32:30.094 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:84%
is because anybody that watches
any mass media is certainly

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:84%
going to notice the
preponderance of drug ads,

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:84%
especially in
primetime programming.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:90%
This isn't an accident.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not the only industry
that has any money left.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.310 align:middle line:84%
There is collusion happening
at a very high level

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.600 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.942 align:middle line:84%
And definitely, thank
you for your story.

00:32:49.942 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's worth bringing up.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking another
really big, big, big story.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.610 align:middle line:84%
You could say collusion and you
could explain how that works.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:59.917 align:middle line:90%
And that is Obamacare.

00:32:59.917 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know a lot of people
watching this are liberal

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and looking forward
to the justice that

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.490 align:middle line:84%
is embedded within that new
program set to take effect

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:90%
in 2014.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yeah.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about Obamacare.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I know it's one of
your favorite subjects.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Sure.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
can narrow it down

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and keep it specific
to health care.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But really, we're talking
something more general here.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: We are.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how does the
DSM interface with Obamacare?

00:33:30.115 --> 00:33:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Is this coming out in
alignment for a reason?

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.521 align:middle line:90%
Is the timing--

00:33:33.521 --> 00:33:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Plug it in.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT:
Obamacare is basically

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:84%
like a complicated
insurance company.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
cover certain things

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.153 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going
to cover other things.

00:33:45.153 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what an
insurance company does.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.280 align:middle line:84%
If you walk into
a doctor's office

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and you go blah, blah,
blah, and the doctor goes,

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:58.080 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, blah, the
diagnosis is either

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.910 align:middle line:84%
going to be covered
in your insurance

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:90%
or it's not going to be.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same
with Obamacare.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Except in the case of
Obamacare, the Department

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:84%
of Health and Human
Services-- which

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:84%
is an executive branch
cabinet post-- in collusion

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:84%
you can bet with
pharmaceutical companies

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:22.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to make up a master
list of all-- all diseases,

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:27.760 align:middle line:84%
disorders that exist that will
be covered under Obamacare,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and what permitted treatments
exist for those conditions.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, OK.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.250 align:middle line:90%
We diagnosis this.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:90%
OK, we give that drug.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:35.440 align:middle line:90%
We diagnosis this.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.219 align:middle line:90%
OK, we give that.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:84%
And as time goes by,
years up the road from now

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:46.540 align:middle line:84%
assuming that this survives
the constitutional challenges,

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.080 align:middle line:84%
it's going to get tighter
and tighter and tighter.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
robotic system, basically.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:90%
More and more and more and more.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to plug the
DSM directly into Obamacare.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.280 align:middle line:84%
In other words, however
many mental disorders

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:84%
officially exist-- and
let's say 400-- OK,

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.615 align:middle line:84%
if you're a psychiatrist you can
diagnose any one of these 400

00:35:05.615 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:90%
and you get paid.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But of course, you've
got to prescribe

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.270 align:middle line:90%
the drugs that are involved.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Big Pharma's really--
they're into Obamacare.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.550 align:middle line:84%
They see it as a gigantic
amount of profit for them.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.570 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to let the slide by.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we have a
subset of physicians

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:84%
in northern California who
are making diagnoses here.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But what are they doing here
with herbs and so forth?

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's look into that.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's send in a team to
find out what's going on.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.475 align:middle line:84%
Let's plant a few
patients in these officers

00:35:35.475 --> 00:35:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and see, why are they diverging
from permitted treatments

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:84%
under the plan for
the future of America?

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And they discover what's
going on, and boom.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They can kick these doctors
out of the plan, in which case

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.610 align:middle line:84%
they're really excommunicated
into the outer darkness

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:56.670 align:middle line:84%
because the plan
is all there is.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And the patients now can't
get the same kind of treatment

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.240 align:middle line:90%
they could before.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing
is, it's going

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:84%
to be lockstep conformity more
and more as we go up the line.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:13.130 align:middle line:84%
It's going to try to
eliminate alternatives.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.286 align:middle line:84%
That's Big Pharma's-- one
of their big ambitions.

00:36:15.286 --> 00:36:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.320 align:middle line:90%
To eradicate it.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.256 align:middle line:84%
Now how does this interface
with a broken economy?

00:36:20.256 --> 00:36:20.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:84%
How is Obamacare and the fact
that this nation is way beyond

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.507 align:middle line:90%
broke work together?

00:36:27.507 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking
about this narrowing

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.420 align:middle line:84%
down and the restriction of
what will and won't be covered,

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I start thinking economic
factors right away.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: You should because
the unfunded liabilities,

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:84%
as they like to call
them, of Obamacare,

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.920 align:middle line:84%
if you begin to
crunch the numbers,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.770 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like watching
two gigantic trucks

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:54.250 align:middle line:84%
on a very narrow highway
heading toward each other.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And you see it
coming, and there's

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:90%
going to be an explosion.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Because yes.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.021 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we're printing money.

00:37:02.021 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
in business for.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.790 align:middle line:90%
We just keep on printing.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:10.110 align:middle line:84%
We now have QE3, which basically
means we print forever.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And here's Obamacare looming up.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
sucking up trillions.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Where are we going
to get that from?

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's whistling in the
dark, but here come the trucks.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So that explosion could
happen regardless.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.410 align:middle line:90%
But you're absolutely right.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.370 align:middle line:84%
There will be a narrowing
down of what's coverable

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and how it's going to be
covered and with how much

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:84%
wait time it's going to be
covered as the system gets

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:90%
more and more financially broke.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: And as it
becomes more untenable

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.270 align:middle line:84%
because it's so complicated
and because people

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that are enmeshed in
it can't carry it out

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.029 align:middle line:84%
because they don't even
know all the rules,

00:37:54.029 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:84%
because all the rules
haven't been written.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's thievery, theft,
corruption, incompetence.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:03.790 align:middle line:84%
The usual government
nonsense and bureaucracy.

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:10.257 align:middle line:84%
Which adds to even worsening
the whole situation, so bad.

00:38:10.257 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And so now you have
people that are now

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.330 align:middle line:84%
wanting to go outside
the system, obviously.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.497 align:middle line:84%
The system isn't going to
be-- for all of the people

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:21.746 align:middle line:84%
watching this, I can't imagine
there's a single person

00:38:21.746 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:84%
watching that hasn't already
gone outside the system

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.064 align:middle line:90%
and isn't going to need to.

00:38:25.064 --> 00:38:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Now first of all, we
won't have a choice.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.959 align:middle line:84%
We have to participate
in Obamacare, right?

00:38:29.959 --> 00:38:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Right.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or we suffer a fine.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.892 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Right.

00:38:32.892 --> 00:38:33.433 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:33.433 --> 00:38:35.389 align:middle line:84%
That's different from
insurance of times past.

00:38:35.389 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Before it just got
swept up somewhere else.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But here, you will
be fined to do that.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Now the doctors are going to
be watched more closely as you

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.150 align:middle line:84%
said, so they're not
going to be able.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.930 align:middle line:84%
This whole movement
toward beginning

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:51.520 align:middle line:84%
integrative and complementary
therapies that's happening,

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
we'll be seeing an end to
that is what you're saying.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Not right
away, but eventually yes.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.745 align:middle line:90%
That would be my prediction.

00:38:57.745 --> 00:38:59.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
see it narrowing.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:00.138 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:39:00.138 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Streamlined medicine.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.710 align:middle line:90%
They'll PR that.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.730 align:middle line:90%
This is streamlined.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're going to be
carving away and eliminating

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.280 align:middle line:90%
as much as they can.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happens now
to the now growing millions

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and millions of
disenfranchised people

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
that are not going to be
so on board with Obamacare?

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can do what
people like myself do now.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:84%
You just pay your HMO in
case you get into a car wreck

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and have to be
stitched back together.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:84%
But for health care, I
wouldn't use that system.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually afraid of
that system and watching

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.430 align:middle line:90%
what they do, right?

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have to pay a premium
to go outside the system.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Are these practitioners
that are working

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.710 align:middle line:84%
outside the system and
people like your lovely wife,

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, naturopath--
how are they

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.980 align:middle line:84%
going to function with
Obamacare in place?

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.910 align:middle line:90%
How's that going to happen?

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there will be
no insurance billing,

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I would assume, for any
of these people, right?

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're out of
that stream of income.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.626 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: A lot
on them have been out

00:40:00.626 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of that stream for a long time.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:07.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, people have to
recognize there's today.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:90%
There's five years.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.790 align:middle line:84%
There's 10 years in
the future, right?

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So I've been at this for
30 years investigating

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:90%
these people.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's not difficult
for me to predict

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:18.850 align:middle line:90%
where things are headed.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:84%
For example who, in 1952
or 1953 when a drug called

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Ritalin somehow first appeared
on the scene and a few kids

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.280 align:middle line:84%
were being treated with it,
who would have predicted

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that all these years later,
more than five million children

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.970 align:middle line:84%
in America, mostly
boys, are suddenly

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:38.000 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with something that
has no test whatsoever called

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.490 align:middle line:84%
ADHD and are drugged with
this thing which is actually

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:84%
amphetamine and that
nobody seems to mind it?

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's just for beginners.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So to be able to see up the
road is what I'm talking about,

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.691 align:middle line:90%
where this is going to go, OK?

00:40:55.691 --> 00:40:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I think
is going to happen,

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.606 align:middle line:84%
at first-- there's
a lot of people

00:40:58.606 --> 00:41:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that are going to say,
well, I'll pay the penalty

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it
is, and I'll still

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:84%
go outside and see my
alternative whatever.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But as the generations--
young people get old.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:12.536 align:middle line:90%
Where's this really leading?

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a tremendous
propaganda machine

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.020 align:middle line:84%
behind this whole
idea of Obamacare.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Loyalty to the system.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Be a part of the system.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Be in the system.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And that person who is outside
there in the underground

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:90%
has a kid.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.490 align:middle line:90%
And that kid grows up.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that kid is now
like, what was my mother doing?

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:90%
That was like back in the '60s.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.670 align:middle line:84%
They were all
smoking that stuff.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:35.217 align:middle line:84%
But now I'm living
the normal life.

00:41:35.217 --> 00:41:36.550 align:middle line:90%
I want to be part of the system.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, the system is Obamacare.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, wonderful.

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Sign me up.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And gradually there's
attrition from the underground,

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.000 align:middle line:84%
the outside underground,
because more people

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.930 align:middle line:90%
are moved into the system.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:51.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like what happened
to corporate America.

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.390 align:middle line:84%
More and more people
discovered as the '60s

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:84%
turned into the '70s,
the '80s, and the '90s,

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that if you were not going
to join corporate America,

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:04.100 align:middle line:84%
you were going to have to be
extremely clever, extremely

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:84%
smart, extremely
resourceful, and make

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:08.600 align:middle line:90%
your own way in the world.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And so fewer and fewer people
were willing to drop out.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And would that have been
predictable in 1967?

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of some gigantic
protest against the Vietnam

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.540 align:middle line:90%
War?

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:90%
This is forever, baby.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.350 align:middle line:84%
The next generation doesn't
look at it that way.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:30.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, because I lived
close to UCLA in the 1970s,

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:84%
as soon as the Vietnam
War ended-- and UCLA

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:39.730 align:middle line:84%
was one of the hotbeds of
revolt during the Vietnam War--

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.190 align:middle line:90%
a switch was thrown at UCLA.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It was like Vietnam
never happened.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
the students were

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:52.580 align:middle line:84%
talking about my niche
in the job market.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to
do when I graduate?

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you saying this
was a natural kind of response

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.470 align:middle line:84%
or a reaction to, or was
it coming from elsewhere?

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: I think it
was the response of people

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:09.300 align:middle line:84%
who were exhausted and
found a good reason to stop

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.100 align:middle line:90%
rebelling against the system.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.940 align:middle line:90%
That's what a juggernaut does.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And here's a juggernaut called
National Health Insurance,

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:18.800 align:middle line:90%
or Obamacare.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to keep on
going down the superhighway.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And as time passes more
people will collect to it

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and fewer people will
take on the drama

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.580 align:middle line:90%
of a life outside the system.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.619 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:32.619 --> 00:43:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: And I think that
makes sense to a lot of people,

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.720 align:middle line:90%
and they can see that.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not tomorrow, but
it's going to happen.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
about a more quiet kind

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.249 align:middle line:84%
of underground rebellion
that could take place?

00:43:44.249 --> 00:43:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Where it's not so
much fighting, it's

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.380 align:middle line:90%
simply more ignoring the system.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Because again, I think
most of the people

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.520 align:middle line:84%
watching this are already
prepared to simply

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.720 align:middle line:84%
quietly continue taking
matters into their own hands.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Could there come a point where
there's enough critical mass

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:84%
that something could
develop alongside it,

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:05.130 align:middle line:84%
alongside Obamacare, something
of a significant nature?

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Or will it always
be people looking

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:84%
for each other in an
underground world?

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: The latter I
think is where it's headed now.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
going to be collegial

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:21.110 align:middle line:84%
where Big Pharma's
going to say, all right.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's give 'em
$100 billion a year

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.249 align:middle line:84%
for alternative whatever
out there, right?

00:44:25.249 --> 00:44:27.040 align:middle line:84%
We still have our
trillion dollar business.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.190 align:middle line:90%
No, they want everything.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And they see a
way of getting it.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're going
to do whatever they

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.070 align:middle line:84%
can to marginalize
everybody else.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's going to
be friendly and collegial.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:90%
But I agree with you.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
you see who are saying,

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.252 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is silly.

00:44:45.252 --> 00:44:47.242 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
quietly drop out

00:44:47.242 --> 00:44:48.450 align:middle line:90%
and nobody's going to notice.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'll pay my fine.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Everything is going to be good.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:90%
I agree now, yeah.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.150 align:middle line:90%
But do you have kids?

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.840 align:middle line:84%
What's the next
generation going to do?

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.630 align:middle line:90%
What's the future going to do?

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.590 align:middle line:84%
This is how it
changes over time.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the people who are
on the outside, you see, there

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.630 align:middle line:90%
are fewer of them.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Which means that there are fewer
resources to accommodate them

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.877 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
game of economics.

00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:84%
How many practitioners
are going to be

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.830 align:middle line:84%
out there if instead
of, let's say,

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:84%
20 million people in America
that are seeking alternatives,

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:90%
it's only 10.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And you and I talked
off camera about this.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:27.425 align:middle line:84%
This is really
going to come down

00:45:27.425 --> 00:45:31.190 align:middle line:84%
to more-- this is almost
a spiritual crisis that's

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.800 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.973 align:middle line:90%
That is what it is.

00:45:32.973 --> 00:45:34.264 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: That's what it is.

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And here
you have medicine

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:39.680 align:middle line:84%
which is, the way
it is right now

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.050 align:middle line:84%
is a wholly materialistic
view of what a human body is,

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:84%
essentially meat with chemicals
and functions and such

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
incredibly complex,

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.380 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional beings
that we actually are.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And again, millions
and millions of people

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.000 align:middle line:84%
are waking up to this reality
that they're a lot more

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:84%
than this bag of
bones, so to speak.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we were talking
about this off camera

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:11.060 align:middle line:84%
we were sharing some information
about a particular drawing that

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.780 align:middle line:90%
is very rare that I had found.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But before we get to that,
you had an experience

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.360 align:middle line:84%
in your own right in
Southern California.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.319 align:middle line:90%
You went into a vault.

00:46:19.319 --> 00:46:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And I would like you to
explain a little bit about what

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:24.530 align:middle line:84%
you were doing, because this
is central to the story.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:28.310 align:middle line:84%
If we can't understand
we're more than simply

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.450 align:middle line:84%
flesh, bones, and
chemicals, we're

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.620 align:middle line:84%
not going to find our
way out of this mess.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: That's right.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
ultimate rebellion

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.350 align:middle line:90%
against where we're at.

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been talking about
psychiatry for almost an hour

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.650 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is a pseudo scientist's
nightmare based on the idea

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.600 align:middle line:84%
that we are all only
physical and there's

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:84%
nothing left except chemical
reactions in the brain.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Now to the degree that a culture
or a civilization or a society

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.690 align:middle line:84%
would accept that view of
things, they're doomed.

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.010 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely doomed.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:07.762 align:middle line:84%
But now as you say, many
people are waking up

00:47:07.762 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:90%
to the notion, wait a minute.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:09.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:14.270 align:middle line:90%


00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.520 align:middle line:90%
We're talking spirit here.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.330 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
creative power here.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.600 align:middle line:90%
We're talking magic.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.020 align:middle line:90%
We're talking dimensions.

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.870 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
multiple dimensions

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:30.650 align:middle line:84%
of non physical reality
or physical reality

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:35.370 align:middle line:90%
in different types of energy.

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:38.140 align:middle line:84%
From that point of
view, you look down

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:42.340 align:middle line:84%
at what's going on in the field
of especially psychiatry, which

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:46.390 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
all about the mind,

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and you see it's
completely absurd.

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They have ruled out all
of this bigger picture.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So, many years ago I was working
doing some stories for "L.A.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Weekly" in Los
Angeles and I wanted

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to do a story on the
Philosophical Research Society,

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Manly Hall, a venerated
institution, marvelous library,

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.224 align:middle line:90%
great location in Los Angeles.

00:48:09.224 --> 00:48:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And brilliant man.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Beyond brilliant.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.549 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: The pink,
the famous pink building.

00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:15.590 align:middle line:90%
And so I went over there.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And as part of the
whole situation

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I was taken on a
tour of their library

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:84%
of very esoteric, philosophical,
metaphysical literature.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I was told, you
know, there's a vault here.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:30.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.451 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where we keep
the most rare volumes.

00:48:33.451 --> 00:48:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to see it?

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.680 align:middle line:90%
So tic tic tic tic tic.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Open the vault.

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.014 align:middle line:90%
I go inside.

00:48:40.014 --> 00:48:40.930 align:middle line:90%
And there are shelves.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a rather small, as I
remember, circular vault.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.540 align:middle line:90%
This is maybe 20, 25 years ago.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:49.990 align:middle line:90%
And there are all these volumes.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I'd like
to stay here for a week

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:56.280 align:middle line:90%
to find out what's really here.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And I see these
books sticking out

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.446 align:middle line:84%
of one shelf that
are triangular.

00:49:00.446 --> 00:49:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Like a regular book
except instead of it's

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.340 align:middle line:84%
regular on one side, but it
comes to a point on the other.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And you open the point and
the pages are all triangular.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:16.836 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this and
I'm kind of in a feverish state

00:49:16.836 --> 00:49:18.210 align:middle line:84%
of mind, because
I know I've got,

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.340 align:middle line:84%
like, three minutes
to be in the vault.

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who's
leading me on the tour

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:25.470 align:middle line:84%
is saying something to me that
I'm not really listening to,

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:84%
because I'm looking at these
incredible cosmological

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.420 align:middle line:90%
diagrams.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Very complex.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.580 align:middle line:84%
They all looked to me as
if they were done by hand.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Some with colors,
some black and white.

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:42.070 align:middle line:84%
They show a human
figure in some of them

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
incredible lines

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and things and dimensions
happening around him, right?

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
these were alchemists,

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.280 align:middle line:90%
heretics during medieval times.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm listening
to what he's saying.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:01.328 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
find out, is this

00:50:01.328 --> 00:50:02.880 align:middle line:84%
a reproduction I'm
looking at or is

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.130 align:middle line:84%
this the original that
somebody's found here?

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.920 align:middle line:90%
And what else have you got here?

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a minute
left in here, you know.

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.820 align:middle line:90%
And we left.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't really have
the answers that I wanted.

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just staggered out
of there because talk

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:21.990 align:middle line:84%
about historical,
multi-dimensional view

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:25.090 align:middle line:84%
of the human being, of what
an individual human being is.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.380 align:middle line:84%
This was a whole heretical
tradition obviously

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:32.080 align:middle line:84%
going on in Europe during
the reign of the Roman church

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.870 align:middle line:84%
when if you varied one
stick away from doctrine,

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.010 align:middle line:84%
you would be burned
and so forth.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And the picture
that you showed me

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.710 align:middle line:90%
reminded me very much of this.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
human being displayed

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:90%
in spiritual dimensions.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The one we're
looking at right now,

00:50:50.255 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that's how Western, modern
science views a human being.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't see it because
the monitor's to your back.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But that's how they view us in
terms of our mental functioning

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:90%
and our personality and such.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a head with some
colored quadrants diagramming

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:06.940 align:middle line:84%
where speech comes from,
where memory comes from.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.939 align:middle line:84%
Which of course we know
isn't even true anymore.

00:51:08.939 --> 00:51:10.754 align:middle line:84%
But now let's take
a look at the one

00:51:10.754 --> 00:51:11.920 align:middle line:90%
you were just talking about.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I think what
you saw may have

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:17.880 align:middle line:84%
been even aspects of this
one that we're going to see.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Now this is just the
beginning, just a taste of it.

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
secretive diagram.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:31.210 align:middle line:84%
This particular one was
drawn by a man in Mexico

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.360 align:middle line:90%
in the mid 1700s.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:39.134 align:middle line:84%
But this is the larger view
of what a human being is.

00:51:39.134 --> 00:51:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you just
look at this, what's

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.180 align:middle line:84%
happening in the center if
you could see these close up

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.810 align:middle line:84%
pictures, this
draws the cosmos in.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:47.300 align:middle line:90%
It has angelic realms.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.380 align:middle line:90%
It has the Kabbalah.

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:53.750 align:middle line:84%
It has astrology, all of
the cosmic influences.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And here's the signature
of the man that did this.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.750 align:middle line:90%
I've talked to many people.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.330 align:middle line:84%
No one has dared explain
the whole thing yet.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:07.340 align:middle line:84%
My guess is that this diagram
is passed down information

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.880 align:middle line:84%
from very, very knowledgeable
secret orders that still exist

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.690 align:middle line:84%
underground, that have
existed from the time

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.560 align:middle line:84%
before Egypt, even into the
Atlantean period of time.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:22.930 align:middle line:84%
That's an understanding
of what a human being is.

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: And this
is what the future holds

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.320 align:middle line:84%
if people are willing
to wake up to this

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and stop the madness
of reductionist science

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that is supposed to be the
ruler of us all at all times.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.746 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're heading as
a very bad materialist society.

00:52:44.746 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Where we could be heading
and where a lot of people

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:84%
are waking up to is exactly
what you're showing there.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that diagram
I'm sure has been well buried.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I've only talked to
one other person who's

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:02.310 align:middle line:84%
even seen a copy of it
and became pretty obsessed

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:06.660 align:middle line:84%
with that just even beginning
to try to comprehend what

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.500 align:middle line:90%
was trying to be said in this.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And the place I
originally saw it

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.960 align:middle line:84%
was a man who was a healer
of extraordinary proportions.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he could
see into the being

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and he could just work
with a little energy

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.740 align:middle line:90%
and it was more or less done.

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said oddly, when
people came to his office,

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:23.810 align:middle line:90%
no one saw it.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.560 align:middle line:84%
It was as though it was
invisible on the wall.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.240 align:middle line:90%
It didn't mean anything.

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.385 align:middle line:84%
And again, isn't there this
incredible period of time

00:53:31.385 --> 00:53:33.760 align:middle line:84%
we're in right now as they
call the thinning of the veils

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.560 align:middle line:84%
where our consciousness is
beginning to expand out to

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.660 align:middle line:84%
where many, many of us
could be asking questions

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.910 align:middle line:84%
about that diagram,
and could be seeking

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:42.780 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of
answers for ourselves?

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Exactly.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And the effect that that has
a person's life, their health,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.800 align:middle line:84%
their state of mind,
their space, their energy,

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.350 align:middle line:84%
their power, their
imagination, their creativity

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:58.740 align:middle line:84%
is so enormous
that it makes all--

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.620 align:middle line:84%
you look back from
that perspective.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what I hope people
can begin to think about.

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Looking from this
multi-dimensional perspective

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:10.520 align:middle line:84%
of what an individual
human being is,

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:14.890 align:middle line:84%
to look now at the
culture of scientism--

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:17.620 align:middle line:84%
not trying to say all science
is bad or anything ridiculous

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:18.120 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But look at where these things
we've been talking about,

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:24.020 align:middle line:84%
where these trends are
really heading here.

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.815 align:middle line:84%
They're heading in the
opposite direction.

00:54:25.815 --> 00:54:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And so really it
seems from what I'm

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.980 align:middle line:84%
hearing you say that our
primary responsibility is

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.540 align:middle line:90%
we have to keep our minds alive.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.930 align:middle line:90%
We have to keep inquiring.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:38.480 align:middle line:90%
We have to keep creating.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.039 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep
stretching ourselves

00:54:41.039 --> 00:54:42.080 align:middle line:90%
to have original thought.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.537 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever it
is that seems to be--

00:54:44.537 --> 00:54:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and if anyone watched
my interview yesterday

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.850 align:middle line:84%
with David Icke, we
speak of larger agendas

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:52.370 align:middle line:84%
there-- whatever it is
that's trying to force us

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:54.650 align:middle line:84%
down this chute
that you're talking

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:59.460 align:middle line:84%
about to that outcome with
so few options with a species

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.760 align:middle line:84%
of drugged,
compliant individuals

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:06.010 align:middle line:84%
can only be overcome by
creativity, by thought,

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.310 align:middle line:90%
by rebellion.

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:08.200 align:middle line:90%
By what else?

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.000 align:middle line:90%
We only have about a minute.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: By imagination.

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Imagination creates reality.

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So somebody's imagination
created this pseudoscience here

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that we have, that we've
been talking about.

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a perverse work of art.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:27.450 align:middle line:84%
You just look at it
and you say, well, yes.

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:28.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if this is what you want
to do you're completely insane.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And we know now what the
real definition of insanity

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:37.490 align:middle line:84%
is because we see
what you've done here.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a work of art
created by imagination.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that I can
create something.

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:43.430 align:middle line:90%
I can imagine something better.

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, as
Don Miguel Ruiz says,

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:48.570 align:middle line:84%
you have to be the artist
that creates your own painting

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:49.950 align:middle line:90%
on your own blank canvas.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
buy this garbage

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.410 align:middle line:90%
that we're being encouraged to.

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:55.092 align:middle line:84%
And on that, I know
we're out of time.

00:55:55.092 --> 00:55:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you so much
for taking time to be here.

00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're going to
have another conversation down

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:00.730 align:middle line:90%
the road.

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:01.955 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Oh, I
know we will have many.

00:56:01.955 --> 00:56:03.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Until next time.

00:56:03.038 --> 00:56:04.072 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:04.072 --> 00:56:06.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're like Jon and
me, you may have already

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.904 align:middle line:84%
taken your health and
that of your loved ones

00:56:07.904 --> 00:56:08.967 align:middle line:90%
into your own hands.

00:56:08.967 --> 00:56:11.050 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to be forced
to go underground then

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:13.020 align:middle line:84%
we need to know where
the resources are.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I hope you'll continue to come
here to Gaiam to learn more

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:18.366 align:middle line:84%
about what you can do to
protect and help yourself.

00:56:18.366 --> 00:56:19.990 align:middle line:84%
We'll do everything
we can to bring you

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.710 align:middle line:84%
the most pertinent information
we can toward that end.

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:45.367 align:middle line:90%
