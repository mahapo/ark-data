00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:34.067 align:middle line:84%
>> There has been a nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.202 align:middle line:84%
and the Soviets have
admitted that it happened.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.871 align:middle line:90%
The Soviet version is this.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.406 align:middle line:84%
One of the atomic
reactors at the Chernobyl,

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:42.275 align:middle line:84%
atomic power plant in the
City of Kiev was damaged,

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.811 align:middle line:84%
and there
is speculation in Moscow

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.581 align:middle line:84%
that people were injured
and may have died.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.082 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets may have
been fairly quick

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.252 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge the accident
because evidence in the form

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.455 align:middle line:84%
of mild and nuclear radiation
had already reached beyond the

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.791 align:middle line:90%
Soviet borders to Scandinavia.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.893 align:middle line:84%
>> Barack Obama: We do
not expect harmful levels

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.997 align:middle line:84%
of radiation to reach the
West Coast, Hawaii, Alaska,

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:07.934 align:middle line:84%
or the U.S. territories
in the Pacific.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.204 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:14.808 align:middle line:84%
and public health experts
do not recommend that people

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:18.211 align:middle line:84%
in the United States take
precautionary measures beyond

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.446 align:middle line:90%
staying informed.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.014 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
It's becoming clear

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.518 align:middle line:84%
that the nuclear disasters at
Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:26.953 align:middle line:90%
in 2011 were much more serious

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.588 align:middle line:84%
than the public has
been led to believe.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.124 align:middle line:84%
From contaminated reactor
water leaking into the ocean

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:34.694 align:middle line:84%
to rain clouds, depositing
radioactive elements

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:36.963 align:middle line:84%
around the world, I
believe it's time to speak

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.332 align:middle line:84%
about how it's affecting us
in what we can do about it.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.903 align:middle line:84%
Fukushima is the only
the latest nuclear event

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:44.538 align:middle line:84%
and no one really
knows the true nature

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.606 align:middle line:90%
of what devastation is to come.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.375 align:middle line:84%
But we can learn from people
who lived through Chernobyl.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.912 align:middle line:84%
One of those people
is Katrine Volynsky.

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:54.247 align:middle line:84%
Katrine has an amazing
story of both the effects

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:58.518 align:middle line:84%
of radiation exposure and how
to cleanse it from our bodies.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
Katrine, welcome

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.157 align:middle line:84%
and how did you feel watching
those two sound bites?

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Katrine Volynsky: Oh my
gosh, especially the first one,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.296 align:middle line:84%
you know, being there
and experiencing it all

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.399 align:middle line:84%
and seeing how it was seen in
the west.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's correct that.

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:15.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: You know, this
is the first time I've seen.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:16.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Really?

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:17.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:19.973 align:middle line:84%
So from your perspective,
now, you were very young,

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.608 align:middle line:84%
but looking back on it,
from your perspective,

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
what was happening on the
ground in the Soviet Union?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Well, on the
ground, right when I was a child

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.682 align:middle line:84%
and this was happening,
we didn't know.

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:32.619 align:middle line:84%
There was absolutely no one
else and was nothing that day

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.922 align:middle line:84%
when it was all happening, the
only thing I remember as a child

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
that the sky was
this crazy color.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The sky
was a crazy color?

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah, it was.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.696 align:middle line:90%
I do remember that.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:46.165 align:middle line:84%
And we were in the area,
there was no mentioning

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:49.269 align:middle line:84%
about anything, no one
knew, and they actually got

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.805 align:middle line:90%
onto another destination later,

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:54.908 align:middle line:84%
and no was saying
anything for a while actually.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.543 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea that
this was happening.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:57.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: When you say awhile,

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.179 align:middle line:84%
how long before you
knew what had happened?

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Well, it was
at least couple of weeks

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.083 align:middle line:84%
until we actually even knew
that there was an explosion,

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:07.654 align:middle line:84%
you know, the media was not
as prominent as it is here.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:08.655 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, everyone--

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What was controlled?

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: It was control,
yeah, and there was--

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:15.829 align:middle line:84%
there were talks about it being
an exposure and then that wasn't

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.299 align:middle line:84%
that serious, you know, like
by week three, week four that's

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
when we started
getting more information

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.503 align:middle line:84%
that there were serious
conditions

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.005 align:middle line:84%
and the children
were being moved

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.141 align:middle line:84%
to other places from
the actual area.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So for your
own personal part of that,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.546 align:middle line:84%
you and your family where on a
family outing, and let's talk

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:84%
about when-- during that
event you were moving through,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.386 align:middle line:84%
so we can understand the degree
of direct exposure you had.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.288 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:44.257 align:middle line:84%
We were really close to the
location during the time

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:49.329 align:middle line:84%
of explosion and right past the
explosion, we were in the area

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
that was a little
bit further down

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.268 align:middle line:84%
but it still getting quite a bit
of fallout and actually a lot

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.905 align:middle line:84%
of the children from the area
got moved to where we were.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:03.243 align:middle line:84%
And further down, you know,
after probably six months,

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.546 align:middle line:84%
my family ended up moving
to a place in Belarus

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.048 align:middle line:90%
which was supposedly safe.

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:10.884 align:middle line:84%
There was not supposed
to be much radiation.

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:13.586 align:middle line:90%
It was like mild acid rain.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:14.421 align:middle line:90%
How acid rain can be mild.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:17.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: I have no idea.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.826 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, we moved to those
areas in Belarus and, you know,

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:22.128 align:middle line:84%
we lived there for
the next 8 years

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:24.798 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually the area
that was getting 40 percent

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:29.035 align:middle line:84%
of the fallout for next seven
years after the explosion.

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Again, no one knew.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.838 align:middle line:90%
We were just unlucky that way.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:35.075 align:middle line:84%
And that's where most of the
children that were born actually

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:38.445 align:middle line:84%
after the explosion and not
in the area were getting--

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.413 align:middle line:84%
starting to get defects,
you know,

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.248 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular issues,
hormonal issues.

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:44.384 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of those
children, you know,

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:47.887 align:middle line:84%
everyone in my family
got touched

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
by this explosion
and by radiation.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But yours was
a slightly unique story,

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.495 align:middle line:84%
because everyone in-- well,
it sounds like most everyone

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.364 align:middle line:84%
in your family did
develop cancer.

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Um-hmm.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You did not.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.201 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
distinguishing factor there.

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.705 align:middle line:84%
I was very different in a way
how I was approaching my eating,

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.474 align:middle line:84%
like I declared it
since I was child.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.142 align:middle line:90%
I was not going to eat meat.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:13.713 align:middle line:84%
And I think this was one of the
reasons why it didn't touched me

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:18.685 align:middle line:84%
as much because a lot of
the wild game, a lot of meat

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:21.755 align:middle line:84%
from cows and pigs,
everything that was being used

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.324 align:middle line:84%
in a villages around
because you were probably--

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
most of your food sources came
actually from your own backyard

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.763 align:middle line:84%
and from your own
slaughter house, I guess.

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:32.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So, I was
not one of those children.

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.334 align:middle line:84%
I was not eating a lot
of the animal products.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because it
was being concentrated

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.637 align:middle line:84%
into the tissues
of all the animals.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Exactly.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.775 align:middle line:84%
So, most of the issues that
the children and, you know,

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:84%
adults were getting
were from consumption

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.846 align:middle line:84%
of contaminated products, and
because we couldn't buy products

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.182 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere else and
that was not available,

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.217 align:middle line:84%
they had to eat something
that was grown in the area,

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:56.056 align:middle line:84%
that was consistently exposed to
radioactive particles, you know,

00:05:56.056 --> 00:06:00.293 align:middle line:84%
everything from wild berries to,
you know, mushrooms to dairy,

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:02.896 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything has
some kind of concentration

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:04.831 align:middle line:90%
of reactive nucleotides.

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was growing up,
I remember once everyone knew

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.538 align:middle line:84%
and everyone was talking about
it that there is radiation

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
like we were checking
soil every day,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.042 align:middle line:84%
like my grandmother was checking
soil, and checking the water,

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.044 align:middle line:84%
making sure it was
safe to drink,

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.712 align:middle line:90%
you know, but how safe is safe?

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: You know?

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so what happened
to the rest of your family?

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.918 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: The rest of my
family, everyone is alive.

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.085 align:middle line:90%
This is-- We've been extremely--

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:26.953 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's a good news.

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:27.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: -- lucky.

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:29.055 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, extremely lucky.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.925 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is alive,
we had a few cancers.

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:36.062 align:middle line:84%
One of my cousins, you know, she
was 15 years old at the time,

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:39.265 align:middle line:84%
and she got leukemia, she
was in a ward with 40 kids,

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:43.269 align:middle line:84%
and today there is only her and
then that child that's alive.

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:46.473 align:middle line:84%
So you can understand the, you
know, how the difficult it was.

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:47.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: How the severity.

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:47.841 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:48.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: And
then once again,

00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:51.644 align:middle line:90%
it was not the children right

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:52.879 align:middle line:84%
at the Chernobyl, it was
children that were living

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.814 align:middle line:84%
in Belarus that were
getting the fallout.

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:56.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: That was
supposedly not harmful,

00:06:58.685 --> 00:06:59.886 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:01.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And was
there a high degree

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.623 align:middle line:90%
of mortality among young people?

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:06.426 align:middle line:90%
As you say, only a couple

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.596 align:middle line:84%
out of those 40 are still alive
today and they were young.

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:10.964 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: They were young.

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:12.665 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
how it was happening.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't right away.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:17.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: You know, like
we're looking at casualties

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.572 align:middle line:84%
from nuclear exposure, it's
usually people that are kind

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.207 align:middle line:84%
of dying within the
next couple years

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:84%
from the exposure
right in the place.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.212 align:middle line:84%
This was happening overtime
as people are getting--

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:29.482 align:middle line:84%
developing cancer,
cardiovascular disease and,

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.584 align:middle line:84%
you know, disease that
were really affecting them.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:34.554 align:middle line:84%
And it was taking years but it
was still the rates had gone

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:37.857 align:middle line:84%
up quite significantly
in the area.

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:40.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And for you,
you didn't escape it.

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.628 align:middle line:90%
You just didn't have cancer.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:42.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so let's
talk about what happened

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:45.899 align:middle line:84%
with your own body because
it was equally as dramatic

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:48.635 align:middle line:90%
and you did die in the process.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: I did.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:50.904 align:middle line:84%
Well, what ended up
happening with me,

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.405 align:middle line:90%
I end up getting extreme anemia

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:57.744 align:middle line:84%
and really disturbing
endocrinology issues.

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Nosebleeds?

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Nosebleeds, that
was like normal for everyone.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Everyone
was having nosebleeds?

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Pretty
much everyone

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.753 align:middle line:84%
in schools getting nosebleeds,
that was normal thing.

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.888 align:middle line:90%
Nosebleeds, not such a big deal.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:13.826 align:middle line:84%
I was getting issues with my
hormones and in the process

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:18.131 align:middle line:84%
of couple times bleeding
pretty much to death.

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:21.234 align:middle line:84%
I died, pretty much
did die to death.

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:26.105 align:middle line:84%
I died, and I was clinically
dead for seven minutes

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:29.842 align:middle line:84%
and magically I came
back, you know--

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, there
were-- we talked off camera,

00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:32.512 align:middle line:84%
there were some emotional
components.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: There was
big emotional components.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And there's
always love.

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:37.050 align:middle line:84%
There's always love that seems
to be pulling people back

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.852 align:middle line:84%
and your love for your
grandmother who really took care

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:40.753 align:middle line:90%
of you and raised you.

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:41.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:42.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:44.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: That was definitive
factor of why I came back.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: It was
definitely not my time

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.294 align:middle line:84%
and was also the love
for my grandmother.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:51.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: At the same
time you came back

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.933 align:middle line:84%
and you've had a
very exciting life.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:55.501 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time to
get into your life,

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's the kind that
movies are based upon

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.106 align:middle line:90%
and novels are written about.

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.774 align:middle line:90%
You ended up with in contact

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:04.377 align:middle line:84%
with very interesting
high powered people all

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.679 align:middle line:84%
over the world throughout
your life.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:10.183 align:middle line:84%
But as of quite a few years ago,
you started throwing yourself

00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:13.586 align:middle line:84%
as a result of some of these
health problems into the

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:14.854 align:middle line:84%
solutions and you're probably
one

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of the most intrepid
researchers I've met.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.226 align:middle line:84%
And just so, you know, off
camera, we were talking

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.395 align:middle line:84%
about this, the people
that I interview,

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.497 align:middle line:84%
there's almost no one you
haven't been in contact

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.965 align:middle line:90%
with before I got there.

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.135 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to say
that because what people are

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:32.271 align:middle line:84%
about to hear and we're going
to do another interview as well

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:35.808 align:middle line:84%
on total well-being
is grounded in many,

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:40.279 align:middle line:84%
many years of a very
solid scientific research.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:43.616 align:middle line:84%
And so, let's go
into what happened

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:44.817 align:middle line:84%
from that point,
after you came back.

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So after
I came back,

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.621 align:middle line:84%
and I was still in Russia that
point.

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:53.226 align:middle line:84%
I got somewhat stabilized
by medical terms, you know.

00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:55.662 align:middle line:84%
I was still controlling
my hormones

00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
by just taking birth
control pills

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:02.268 align:middle line:84%
and not feeling amazing ever,
you know, I always had issues

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:06.673 align:middle line:84%
with chronic fatigue
and just low energy.

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:11.077 align:middle line:84%
But in the same time, when
we moved here to America,

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:14.847 align:middle line:84%
it took probably a few more
years of very fast-paced

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle. I ended up going to
university.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.017 align:middle line:90%
I was doing double major.

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:18.751 align:middle line:90%
I was modeling.

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.787 align:middle line:90%
I was working.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.556 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of stress, not
enough taking care of yourself.

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:27.427 align:middle line:84%
Now as much as I know about
my health, I'm just surprised

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:29.462 align:middle line:84%
that my body had
survived this long.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.697 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:32.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: And by the
time I was in my early 20s,

00:10:32.364 --> 00:10:36.469 align:middle line:84%
like my body just started
shutting down, organ by organ,

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.906 align:middle line:84%
you know, system by system, I
started feeling worse and worse

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:43.443 align:middle line:84%
and no one could tell
me how to fix myself.

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.478 align:middle line:84%
And no one could tell me
that it was from radiation.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.347 align:middle line:84%
It actually took quite a
bit of digging to figure it

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:50.783 align:middle line:84%
out that it was still in my
body, it was still affecting.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:51.984 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: In the bone marrow?

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: In the
bone marrow, yes,

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.054 align:middle line:84%
it actually took bone
marrow sample to figure

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:56.556 align:middle line:90%
out that it was still there

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:59.125 align:middle line:84%
and still affecting my
body all these years later.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now, your an
extreme example of someone

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:04.931 align:middle line:84%
who was right near ground
zero more or less and grew

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:06.632 align:middle line:84%
up in the effects
of this fallout,

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:10.837 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is this is
what people don't understand

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.506 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.942 align:middle line:84%
We feel a... great
compassion for the people

00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:19.278 align:middle line:84%
in Japan and what's going on and
many people have been impacted.

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:21.748 align:middle line:84%
But what's not as well known
because the media doesn't talk

00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:25.451 align:middle line:84%
about it is that there is
a drift that is occurring

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:28.755 align:middle line:84%
of this radiation which is only
increasing in its output now,

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:30.256 align:middle line:90%
a couple years later more--

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.592 align:middle line:84%
two and a half, almost three
years later, it's increasing

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to go
with the clip I talked

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.498 align:middle line:84%
with Patrick Flanagan, who you
also know a couple of days ago,

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:39.832 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to just
tell us a little bit

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:43.169 align:middle line:90%
about what their finding, OK?

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:46.572 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to that.

00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Patrick Flanagan: I have a
full spectrum Geiger counter

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.313 align:middle line:84%
that is able to measure
everything

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:58.484 align:middle line:84%
and tell me exactly
what is there,

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:07.727 align:middle line:84%
everything from plutonium
232, uranium, weapons grade,

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:15.601 align:middle line:84%
reactor grade, plutonium,
CCM 137, iodine 131,

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:21.941 align:middle line:84%
all of these isotopes
we can measure precisely

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:24.644 align:middle line:90%
with that device.

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It's coming over and
polluting the waters

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:35.188 align:middle line:84%
of the entire west coast,
all the way from Canada,

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:39.659 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
tip of South America.

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:48.501 align:middle line:84%
And there's a huge amount of
radiation in the water and some

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:52.872 align:middle line:84%
of it's also in the air
sweeping over because...

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:58.044 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, we're getting
more radiation than the people

00:12:58.044 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:90%
who live in Japan are getting

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.749 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
blowing this way.

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:09.355 align:middle line:84%
I've tested a girl who lived
right on the edge of Fukushima

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:14.527 align:middle line:84%
and she had less radiation in
her body than people in Hawaii

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:19.432 align:middle line:84%
or some of the people
coming from the west coast.

00:13:19.432 --> 00:13:22.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Ooh, that
kind of flies in the face

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.204 align:middle line:84%
of what Obama was saying at the
top, "No need for the citizens

00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:27.039 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
or elsewhere

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:28.241 align:middle line:90%
to be concerned about this."

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:29.609 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:31.277 align:middle line:84%
And we will find that
there's a complete absence

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:34.247 align:middle line:84%
of the information now that
it is being made available

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:35.614 align:middle line:90%
by other sources.

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:39.218 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go another
scientist in a moment.

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:40.486 align:middle line:84%
That's being made
available to us.

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.521 align:middle line:84%
But this is kind of
an underground circuit

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:43.956 align:middle line:84%
of information, not to
the public at large.

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:46.826 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
what some of the effects

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:47.994 align:middle line:84%
of that radiation
exposure on these

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.663 align:middle line:84%
ongoing, lower levels
is here.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.798 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
how it's being deposited

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:55.768 align:middle line:84%
in other places particularly
in the United States now.

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:59.772 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to Adam
Trombly who I also spoke

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:03.209 align:middle line:90%
with a couple days ago.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:07.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Adam Trombly: On August
28th of 2013, I was sitting

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:10.516 align:middle line:84%
in my office at the Institute
for Advanced Studies at Aspen.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:19.492 align:middle line:84%
And this meter that I have on my
desk wherever I am, basically,

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:24.163 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, there was
an alarm going off

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:26.866 align:middle line:84%
for really much higher
levels of radiation

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:33.439 align:middle line:84%
than are normally present, and
to the point where I put it

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:38.544 align:middle line:84%
on a certain function and
the entire screen was red.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.781 align:middle line:84%
I mean not the-- I mean, you
know, it was all in alarm,

00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:46.385 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't like a pulse
of alarm, it was constant.

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.721 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "Well, gee, I
wonder if there is some kind

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.958 align:middle line:84%
of radon event that's
happened here in this building.

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.359 align:middle line:90%
So I went outside and it was

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:55.828 align:middle line:84%
like almost twice
as bad outside.

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:90%
It was really bad outside.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.798 align:middle line:90%
It was worse.

00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:02.234 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked down the
street in both directions,

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.437 align:middle line:90%
and it was the same everywhere.

00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And then various places
in town it was the same.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.309 align:middle line:84%
We'd been having some
rains, and it turns

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:13.679 align:middle line:84%
out that those rains must
have been very hot rains

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.348 align:middle line:84%
from these isotopes
that are floating

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:19.418 align:middle line:84%
around in self-organizing
ionic clouds from Fukushima all

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.887 align:middle line:84%
over the world and we
just happened to get hit

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:26.993 align:middle line:84%
with a really heavy
concentration August 26th

00:15:26.993 --> 00:15:29.328 align:middle line:90%
and 27th before August the 28th,

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:31.597 align:middle line:90%
and on August 28th as well.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.899 align:middle line:84%
Probably, even, you
know, on August the 25th.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:40.039 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that a friend
of mine took a nine inch corer

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and stuck it into the ground
to see if the soil was hot,

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.345 align:middle line:84%
and it was hot, nine
inches down.

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:47.813 align:middle line:90%
So it'd been soaking rains,

00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:49.281 align:middle line:84%
and it had already
been raining a lot.

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:53.753 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of like
we have this indication

00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:57.289 align:middle line:84%
that this huge pulse, and this
is happening not just in Aspen.

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:59.458 align:middle line:90%
This happens all over the place.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So one
thing we'll bring

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:02.595 align:middle line:84%
up here is he's using the same
device as Patrick Flanagan.

00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the 17,000 dollar
Geiger counter.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.499 align:middle line:84%
It's not the one
you get at Kmart.

00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:10.036 align:middle line:84%
And it is very sophisticated
in what it's able to pick up

00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:13.205 align:middle line:84%
and we don't need to go
into any of the back story

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:15.841 align:middle line:84%
as to why it should have
plutonium, CCM, uranium,

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
things in it.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.045 align:middle line:90%
But that's what's in it.

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:20.446 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is--
So we know that.

00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:21.947 align:middle line:84%
We know that we're being
exposed to that and we know

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:25.551 align:middle line:84%
that these kinds of hot
rain clouds he's talking

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
about are happening
all over the planet.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.424 align:middle line:84%
So that said, that
means we're all being--

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:35.728 align:middle line:84%
to one degree or another exposed
to radiation, to say nothing

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:39.298 align:middle line:84%
of all the atomic testing
over the course of 50 years

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.534 align:middle line:90%
that happened around the globe.

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:43.936 align:middle line:84%
So, what do you-- from what you
have learned in your research,

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:48.174 align:middle line:84%
what are you seeing as
the most common spikes

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.576 align:middle line:90%
in chronic diseases?

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:53.579 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of conditions are
we seeing spikes in as a result

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:57.249 align:middle line:84%
of most likely at least
partially radiation exposure?

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:58.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Well,
definitely any kind of

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.586 align:middle line:90%
endocrinological issues.

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:90%
So anything that's hormones,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.323 align:middle line:84%
especially for women
'cause this is

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:05.958 align:middle line:84%
where we get hit
first, unfortunately.

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:10.395 align:middle line:84%
So any hormone disturbances
you might be experiencing a lot

00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:14.266 align:middle line:84%
of times that's attributed
to exposure to radiation.

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:15.801 align:middle line:90%
Definitely cancer rates too.

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:19.772 align:middle line:84%
I have seen some data
on mortality of infants.

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:22.575 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how accurate it
is but it would make sense

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:25.978 align:middle line:84%
because infants are
so prone to such--

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:26.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Sensitive.

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.948 align:middle line:90%
They're so sensitive.

00:17:28.948 --> 00:17:30.716 align:middle line:84%
So just even a little bit
can push them over the top,

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.953 align:middle line:84%
especially there's the
kind of toxicity levels

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:35.521 align:middle line:90%
that we have in general.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:39.825 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of stresses we
have, and what are children are

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:41.427 align:middle line:84%
born with already wit kind of
issues.

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:42.862 align:middle line:90%
So we have some of that.

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:44.163 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, thyroid,
I know that's part

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:90%
of the endocrine system.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Thyroid.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But it seems
like that's epidemic now.

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:48.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:49.301 align:middle line:90%
And thyroids-- that comes

00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:50.936 align:middle line:84%
from combination
differently of things.

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:53.973 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit of
iodine 131, you know,

00:17:53.973 --> 00:17:58.177 align:middle line:84%
if you get that into your system
that can make a huge difference

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:00.779 align:middle line:84%
on how you're going
to be functioning.

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:03.549 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, thyroid issues,
for sure, because it's part

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.117 align:middle line:90%
of endocrinological system.

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:09.355 align:middle line:84%
But also just general
fatigue, you know, and like me,

00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:12.525 align:middle line:84%
myself chronic fatigue, it has
to do a lot with your sodium,

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:14.727 align:middle line:84%
potassium levels and the
sodium, potassium pump.

00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:18.764 align:middle line:84%
And the CCM 137-- 131,
I mean what they say

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.667 align:middle line:84%
that you get a lot with this
kind of low level radiation,

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:27.173 align:middle line:84%
especially over time because
iodine has less of a lifetime

00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:29.775 align:middle line:90%
and CCM can stay for--

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.544 align:middle line:84%
in an environment for
quite a long time.

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:34.613 align:middle line:84%
It gets concentrated
in the liver,

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:38.617 align:middle line:90%
in your heart, in your muscles.

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:40.886 align:middle line:84%
So it's like kind of get
spread all over the place,

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:43.789 align:middle line:84%
so it can affect
variety of systems.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:44.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What about
the plutonium?

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Oh,
well, that's big ones.

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:49.495 align:middle line:84%
You-- Of course, brain
functioning, you know,

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:52.331 align:middle line:84%
the heart, the liver, the
side effects, the whole body,

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:55.834 align:middle line:84%
and that is very
dangerous one as well.

00:18:55.834 --> 00:19:00.139 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is--
things like CCM and iodine.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Those are manmade.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:84%
They were not here, you
know, 60, 70 years ago.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.645 align:middle line:84%
They only started
occuring in the environment

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:10.883 align:middle line:84%
with our nuclear testing
and with events like this.

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:13.152 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies are not used to
them because there're a lot

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:16.121 align:middle line:84%
of radioactive particles
that our body is used

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:18.757 align:middle line:84%
to like the radioactive
potassium that you find

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:22.294 align:middle line:84%
in bananas, you know, like if
you eat a lot of things, whoa,

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:84%
it's as much radiation
as it is in banana

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.399 align:middle line:84%
or as much radiation as
there is in, you know,

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:28.634 align:middle line:84%
in a flight that you
are taking, right.

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But your body got
used to the potassium.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There's more
natural background radiation.

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:34.373 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:35.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Exactly.

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:36.542 align:middle line:90%
And your body got used to a lot

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:37.943 align:middle line:84%
of those natural
radioactive particles.

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:39.345 align:middle line:84%
But there hasn't been
enough time for us to evolve

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:42.882 align:middle line:84%
to get used to these
nuclear particles.

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:43.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Right.

00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:46.952 align:middle line:84%
So they're affecting variety
of systems, and it also depends

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:49.855 align:middle line:84%
on where the person is
at and their genetic weaknesses.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.323 align:middle line:90%
So these low levels radiation,

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:55.127 align:middle line:84%
you also affect your
lipid oxidation.

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:59.365 align:middle line:84%
So you get a lot of the active
species, you know, radioactive--

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:00.833 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What does that mean?

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:03.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: It means you
get radical-- free radicals.

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK, free radicals.

00:20:05.004 --> 00:20:08.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So in the low
radiation usually affects your

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:09.575 align:middle line:84%
free-- affects
fats, fat cells.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:13.112 align:middle line:90%
And in the fat cells, you have--

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:15.781 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times, a
lot of stored toxins.

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:17.349 align:middle line:84%
So you have the pesticides,
the fertilizers

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:21.854 align:middle line:84%
that we get exposed to, heavy
metals, and kind of other things

00:20:21.854 --> 00:20:23.789 align:middle line:84%
that you might get exposed
to in a daily basis.

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:84%
If you get a reaction
happening in that cell,

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.996 align:middle line:84%
you get all of those things
released into your system,

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:33.565 align:middle line:84%
not just getting a
damage from, you know,

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:35.668 align:middle line:84%
the radioactive particles
affecting your cells

00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:37.136 align:middle line:90%
and dying around.

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:39.338 align:middle line:84%
It's also all of those other
things that gets released

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:42.007 align:middle line:84%
into the system and your body
will have to deal with that.

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:45.077 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us is just not
equipped to deal with it.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we are seeing
increased levels of fatigue,

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.281 align:middle line:90%
also mental fogginess.

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:52.484 align:middle line:84%
It seems that a lot of people
seem somewhat overwhelmed,

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:55.454 align:middle line:84%
and part of it is
just life and stress.

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:56.855 align:middle line:90%
Everything is moving very fast.

00:20:56.855 --> 00:21:00.025 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go really
esoteric and metaphysically

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:02.261 align:middle line:84%
in that direction, you would
say, "There is a speeding up.

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:06.432 align:middle line:84%
There is an impulse for us to
go through very extreme change

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:90%
within our being right now."

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.103 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
beyond that's very tangible

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.639 align:middle line:84%
and very physical in these
fatigue levels as well,

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:14.773 align:middle line:90%
these mental fatigue levels.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.308 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.844 align:middle line:84%
And it also affects all your
brain functioning, obviously,

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:21.213 align:middle line:84%
not just fatigue, but, you
know, we've also seen a lot

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:84%
of rates going up, with
depression and ADHD

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and any kind of, like,
mental disturbance.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.588 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected.

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
It's-- You can't
separate those things.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.891 align:middle line:84%
You can't separate heavy
metals from radiation

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:34.393 align:middle line:84%
and from the other things that
they're getting exposed to.

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.228 align:middle line:90%
It's just here.

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:37.296 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the environment.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: And unfortunately,
a little bit of radiation

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:90%
if the person is already

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
in thea critical state can
just push them over the edge--

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: -- rapidly.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But now we talk
about the good news part of it,

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:53.178 align:middle line:84%
and that is you're obviously
now in vibrant health.

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:56.582 align:middle line:84%
You do things that are-- I mean,
I know what you do as a routine.

00:21:56.582 --> 00:22:00.753 align:middle line:84%
We talked about it off camera,
the kind of workout that you do.

00:22:00.753 --> 00:22:02.755 align:middle line:84%
One of them is-- I
have you tell you this.

00:22:02.755 --> 00:22:04.857 align:middle line:84%
You run up Cathedral
in the morning.

00:22:04.857 --> 00:22:06.458 align:middle line:84%
Now Cathedral is a very
famous Rock in Sedona.

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:09.928 align:middle line:84%
It's my favorite
place in Sedona.

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:12.164 align:middle line:84%
But-- And I've climbed
it many times.

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:16.869 align:middle line:84%
Now, just going up to the-- up
that crevice, up the base of it,

00:22:16.869 --> 00:22:19.204 align:middle line:84%
that takes some time and
you're huffing and puffing,

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:21.807 align:middle line:84%
but you run up that
and down each day.

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:23.642 align:middle line:84%
So, the point is you've
recovered your health.

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:24.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: I did.

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.677 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:26.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: And it took time.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.314 align:middle line:84%
It took a lot of
research, finding people

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:32.017 align:middle line:84%
that were giving me
information and a lot

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.519 align:middle line:90%
of experimentation on myself.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:34.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:36.555 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: It wasn't
just a short, you know, hill.

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:37.289 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: No.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.925 align:middle line:84%
It was really, you know,
focusing on my health,

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:41.927 align:middle line:84%
just stopping everything
I was doing

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:43.162 align:middle line:90%
and finding those solutions.

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:44.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But what
I love about you is

00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:48.033 align:middle line:84%
if you find something is off,
you'll actually take a sample

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.501 align:middle line:84%
of blood and you'll
take it to the lab.

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:51.437 align:middle line:84%
You'll make sure that you
see exactly what's going on

00:22:51.437 --> 00:22:54.406 align:middle line:84%
and you've been relentless in
the pursuit of your urinalysis,

00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:57.576 align:middle line:84%
to see what's improving, what's
not, and seeing what's working.

00:22:57.576 --> 00:23:00.679 align:middle line:84%
So you are a living
walking laboratory.

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:02.047 align:middle line:90%
But it had-- But the--

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: My own
experiment, my own lab rat.

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:04.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You are.

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:05.617 align:middle line:90%
You're your own lab rat.

00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:07.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:08.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But the point is--
I mean you've helped thousands

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:10.088 align:middle line:84%
of other people, help
detox from these things.

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:12.958 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about now
what you feel are some

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:16.595 align:middle line:84%
of the most critical
elements that we need to take.

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:19.164 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
supplementation,

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.834 align:middle line:84%
take into the body to
begin chelating or pulling

00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
out these heavy metals,
including radiation.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So, when
we're talking about removal

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:29.041 align:middle line:84%
of those things, there
are several things

00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:30.742 align:middle line:84%
that are usually
known by people.

00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:32.244 align:middle line:84%
There is chlorella
and Spirulina.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.612 align:middle line:84%
Those got a lot of research
and a lot of publicity.

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.547 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people know about them.

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:37.549 align:middle line:90%
The zeolites--

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:38.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Zeolites.

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:39.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Zeolites.

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:40.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Explain zeolites.

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:42.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Zeolites, they're
kind of like little cages,

00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:44.923 align:middle line:84%
you know, like when
you take them in,

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.625 align:middle line:90%
they cage those particles.

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:50.195 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times they remove
it, but sometimes they don't.

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:54.032 align:middle line:84%
So, zeolites are really good
for detoxifying those particles

00:23:54.032 --> 00:23:56.201 align:middle line:84%
out of your body, and
also heavy metals as well.

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:58.604 align:middle line:84%
But I find that when
you have kidney issues,

00:23:58.604 --> 00:24:01.373 align:middle line:84%
it's harder for the
body to filter it out.

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:05.677 align:middle line:84%
Then there is of course
MSM, we're talking

00:24:05.677 --> 00:24:09.915 align:middle line:84%
about at, and MSM is
extremely amazing at

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:90%
just sulfating all of those.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: For anything.

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:14.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:16.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I had a friend
who was a doctor who was kind

00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:17.789 align:middle line:84%
of off the radar
for obvious reasons

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:22.728 align:middle line:84%
because he was practicing
the reversal of cancer,

00:24:22.728 --> 00:24:26.298 align:middle line:84%
and he put everyone on
a three-week protocol

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.433 align:middle line:84%
of MSM before he would even
introduce anything else

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:32.437 align:middle line:84%
to start sweating the
toxins out of the cells.

00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:33.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:33.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So that's good.

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Yeah, and then
it's also brown seaweed extract

00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:37.676 align:middle line:90%
that's been used a lot.

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:38.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, brown
seaweed extract, yes.

00:24:38.911 --> 00:24:40.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So that's
a really nice one

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:43.682 align:middle line:84%
that can be taken very
easily by a lot of people.

00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:45.584 align:middle line:84%
It's also combinations
of cilantro,

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and there is also
combinations of cilantro

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.888 align:middle line:90%
with zeolises.

00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like all these
combinations of things.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
But what I find that works
amazingly well and it's kind

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.362 align:middle line:90%
of more across the border.

00:24:57.362 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can take
it as apple pectin.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Apple pectin.

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:00.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Apple pectin.

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:01.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It sounds
so innocuous.

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:03.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: I know.

00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:04.736 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So simple.

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:06.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: You
know, it's interesting

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:07.706 align:middle line:84%
because when you start reading
and researching about this,

00:25:07.706 --> 00:25:09.741 align:middle line:84%
you won't find as much
in western nutrition

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:11.343 align:middle line:90%
about apple pectin.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:15.948 align:middle line:84%
And actually what was used
in Russia was apple pectin

00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:21.453 align:middle line:84%
for detoxing children from
Chernobyl and even in my area.

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:24.523 align:middle line:90%
So it was a very easy to get.

00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Was this studied

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:27.459 align:middle line:84%
by the Russian Academy of
Sciences at the time?

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Absolutely, yes.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:30.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:31.797 align:middle line:90%
It was studied quite a bit.

00:25:31.797 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening
is it was cheap.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.935 align:middle line:90%
It was easy to give to children.

00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:39.104 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have any,
you know, side effects.

00:25:39.104 --> 00:25:41.139 align:middle line:84%
So children can take
it very easily

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:43.475 align:middle line:84%
and you could hide
it in the food.

00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:45.143 align:middle line:84%
So I actually talked to my
grandmother said, "Yeah,

00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:48.447 align:middle line:84%
they were giving us-- giving
it to you in your dessert."

00:25:48.447 --> 00:25:49.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:51.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- basically,
you know, so.

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:53.051 align:middle line:84%
And apple pectin is
extremely natural substance

00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:55.954 align:middle line:90%
and it's kind of like a sponge.

00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So it gets into your
intestinal tract

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.593 align:middle line:84%
and it just starts sponging and
cleaning all that stuff out.

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:06.698 align:middle line:84%
It's-- It attracts all the free
radicals and attracts negative,

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:10.035 align:middle line:90%
you know, like, heavy metals.

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:12.404 align:middle line:84%
And it's also amazing at
balancing blood sugar.

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:13.772 align:middle line:84%
It helps with your
fat metabolism.

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a fiber, too.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.643 align:middle line:84%
So it's great for
intestinal health.

00:26:17.643 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Why--
You know, this--

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.713 align:middle line:84%
in America there are
so many detox centers.

00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:25.283 align:middle line:84%
But I don't really hear that
they use so much of apple pectin

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:27.786 align:middle line:84%
and why is it not
that well-known?

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:30.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Well, it is
a lot of times in some

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.556 align:middle line:84%
of the supplements and
it's more like-usually,

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:84%
you get apple fiber and
not the apple pectin.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.295 align:middle line:90%
There is two reasons.

00:26:37.295 --> 00:26:39.731 align:middle line:84%
Fist of all, apple pectin that
is pharmaceutical grade is not

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
as available here
in United States.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it.. should it be
pharmaceutical grade, I mean?

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:47.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Well, it's just
more effective, you know.

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
If you get an apple pectin
from a store, usually,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.845 align:middle line:84%
it's very crude kind of apple
pectin that's used for canning,

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.047 align:middle line:90%
you know, making jams.

00:26:55.047 --> 00:26:56.048 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same stuff.

00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:57.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: But they do have--

00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:00.852 align:middle line:84%
they do have supplemental
apple pectin as well that's not

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:03.622 align:middle line:90%
that pharmaceutical grade.

00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:04.756 align:middle line:90%
There is that in between place.

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:06.224 align:middle line:90%
Can that be helpful?

00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:08.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Yes, it can be
helpful, absolutely, yes.

00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:10.062 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- if you
are looking for one,

00:27:10.062 --> 00:27:13.065 align:middle line:84%
just make sure it's apple
pectin, not apple fiber.

00:27:13.065 --> 00:27:14.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:15.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So a lot of times
it will say apple pectin,

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:17.035 align:middle line:84%
but in fact, it will
be apple fiber.

00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:18.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But because
you're so rabid

00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:19.204 align:middle line:84%
about getting the
best of the best.

00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:21.206 align:middle line:90%
I know that you ran into some--

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:22.641 align:middle line:90%
also some study going

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:84%
on regarding apple pectin
a specific kind that came

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.679 align:middle line:84%
out of Poland and that's where
you became really intrigued.

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:31.083 align:middle line:84%
I got really intrigued by
apple pectin, you know,

00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:35.620 align:middle line:84%
when I got this sample
from Poland of apple pectin

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.656 align:middle line:84%
that was-- not just
pharmaceutical grade but it came

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:41.593 align:middle line:84%
from this little, tiny place
that has a specific conditions

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:45.063 align:middle line:84%
and they were making this apples
that don't grow anywhere else.

00:27:45.063 --> 00:27:46.932 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those
things like wine, you know,

00:27:46.932 --> 00:27:49.634 align:middle line:84%
like you get wine that's
like one door, you know,

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:52.003 align:middle line:84%
like you got a wine that's like
amazing thousand dollar bottles,

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.538 align:middle line:84%
the next door is
like something that's

00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:54.906 align:middle line:90%
like you sell for 5 dollars.

00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:58.176 align:middle line:84%
Same as this place, it's just
amazing conditions developed

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:03.048 align:middle line:84%
this tree and these apples that
have this apple pectin inside

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:05.317 align:middle line:84%
of the peel that is
super, super strong.

00:28:05.317 --> 00:28:08.286 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, it was--
they try to use it for jams

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:11.289 align:middle line:84%
and it was destroying their
jams, you know, it's so strong.

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:14.392 align:middle line:84%
So it got forwarded to a
scientist to study like what's

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:16.728 align:middle line:84%
so different about it and
they found it was just

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:18.096 align:middle line:90%
super concentrated.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:20.298 align:middle line:84%
And they started making
the supplement out of it.

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:22.801 align:middle line:84%
And when I got exposed
to it I was just shocked

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to see how fast it
removes, you know,

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.671 align:middle line:90%
heavy metals out of the body.

00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:27.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you were
doing testing all the way--

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:30.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- with people's
hair samples and so forth.

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: 'Cause I'm
always curious, you know,

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.378 align:middle line:84%
to see something
that works better

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:34.913 align:middle line:90%
and I keep tabs on everything.

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:37.716 align:middle line:84%
So when I saw that, I was like,
wow, this is really amazing.

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.886 align:middle line:84%
And just around the time I
got invited to come to Japan

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.921 align:middle line:84%
and this was right
after Fukushima

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.723 align:middle line:84%
and I was really interested to
see what's going on in there

00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:48.226 align:middle line:84%
for myself, not just, you
know, hearing stories.

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:52.164 align:middle line:84%
So when I got that apple pectin
in my hands, I was really,

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:54.399 align:middle line:84%
really certain that nothing
is going to happen to me

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:58.103 align:middle line:84%
and already everything else that
I had even if there was a lot

00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:00.272 align:middle line:84%
of radiation, I knew
I'm going to be fine.

00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:01.973 align:middle line:90%
I could consume food there.

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:03.542 align:middle line:90%
I could consume water there.

00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:05.944 align:middle line:84%
And I did, you know, for
several months at the time.

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:07.913 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't get
anything in my body.

00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:09.981 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because you are also
using these protocols already.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Yeah, I was
using combination of things,

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:16.321 align:middle line:84%
so I was really solid
in what I usually do,

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:19.157 align:middle line:84%
which is one part is removal
and blocking those, you know,

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:84%
radioactive particles
like with apple pectin

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.628 align:middle line:90%
and zeolites and MSM.

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:25.831 align:middle line:84%
The other part is also
remineralizing the body.

00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:26.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Remineralizing.

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:27.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Oh, yeah.

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:28.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:29.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: That's a big one.

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:31.102 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
you might not see as high

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.738 align:middle line:84%
of cancer rates in
Japan because--

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:36.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They have a
mineral rich diet, don't they?

00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:37.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: They have--

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:40.345 align:middle line:84%
If any culture was able
to handle a situation

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:90%
like this, it would be them.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.815 align:middle line:84%
A lot of studies on healthy
thyroid are based in Japanese

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:48.053 align:middle line:84%
of what they get usually daily
and their diet through seafood.

00:29:48.053 --> 00:29:49.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:29:49.488 --> 00:29:51.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So they were
already naturally equipped

00:29:51.056 --> 00:29:52.057 align:middle line:90%
to deal.

00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:53.358 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And sea vegetables.

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:54.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Sea
vegetables, it also have a lot

00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:56.261 align:middle line:90%
of probiotics in their diet.

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:58.063 align:middle line:90%
Naturally fermented food.

00:29:58.063 --> 00:29:59.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Absolutely.

00:29:59.431 --> 00:30:01.499 align:middle line:84%
Their lifestyle is
completely different from ours.

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:04.369 align:middle line:84%
They're big into alkalinity,
alkaline water those--

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:05.237 align:middle line:90%
all of those factors--

00:30:05.237 --> 00:30:06.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- help you
be a healthy survivor.

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:09.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.343 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: There was actually
study in Hiroshima

00:30:11.343 --> 00:30:13.278 align:middle line:84%
by Allie Steward that she was
looking people who survived

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:14.679 align:middle line:90%
and she figured it out that--

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:16.281 align:middle line:84%
actually people that
were healthy to start

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:18.149 align:middle line:84%
with were able to
survive, you know.

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:19.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, of course.

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Usually
it makes sense, right?

00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:22.621 align:middle line:84%
So, it all goes back
again to remineralization.

00:30:22.621 --> 00:30:25.657 align:middle line:84%
So, they have their prebiotics
and their gut flora in check

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.959 align:middle line:84%
and they had highly
mineralized diet.

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:30.962 align:middle line:84%
So, then you have to look
at several minerals, calcium

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:32.063 align:middle line:90%
and magnesium to be able to--

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:33.765 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Calcium
and magnesium.

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:35.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Calcium and
magnesium to protect you

00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:37.135 align:middle line:90%
from Strontium because--

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:40.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we have
Strontium in our chemtrials

00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:41.640 align:middle line:84%
so we're being exposed
to Strontium.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:30:42.641 --> 00:30:43.208 align:middle line:90%
And its actually...

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: In this, you
know, the body is very amazing.

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:50.448 align:middle line:84%
This is called Selective Uptake
and the body has the things

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:53.785 align:middle line:84%
that it needs like the real
potassium, real sodium,

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:55.387 align:middle line:84%
you know, real calcium,
magnesium, they won't go

00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:58.456 align:middle line:84%
for their radioactive
particles. It won't uptake it,

00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:01.459 align:middle line:84%
it just will get it out
of the system very fast.

00:31:01.459 --> 00:31:05.096 align:middle line:84%
But if doesn't, if it's
deficient it will take it

00:31:05.096 --> 00:31:08.433 align:middle line:84%
into the body, incorporate it
and that's when it starts doing

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:09.734 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the damage because
it's--

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:11.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's a bad
information being taken

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:13.805 align:middle line:84%
in thinking that it's
one type of potassium

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:90%
when it's actually very toxic.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.441 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Exactly.

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:18.877 align:middle line:84%
So, you need calcium and
magnesium made available

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:22.514 align:middle line:84%
for the body to be able
to protect for Strontium,

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:24.082 align:middle line:90%
Iodine and we've heard here

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:26.918 align:middle line:84%
that a lot usually that's
what the warning is.

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.353 align:middle line:90%
To take the iodine, you know,

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:31.323 align:middle line:84%
tablets when there's a big
nuclear thing going on.

00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:32.557 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is,
most of the people

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:35.226 align:middle line:84%
in United States are
deficient in iodine.

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:37.896 align:middle line:84%
And there's a distinction
there and I know Patrick talks

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:39.497 align:middle line:90%
about this a lot and exposed me

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:41.333 align:middle line:84%
to that probably
a dozen years ago

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:43.868 align:middle line:84%
which is there's
potassium iodide

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:45.904 align:middle line:90%
and then there's nascent iodine.

00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.939 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying you have
to take both in order

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:51.776 align:middle line:84%
to get the proper spectrum or
you can throw yourself further

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.778 align:middle line:84%
out of balance by taking
iodine supplements.

00:31:53.778 --> 00:31:54.946 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Absolutely.

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:56.481 align:middle line:90%
And that's another thing, too

00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:58.049 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times you don't want
to self medicate yourself--

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:59.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:31:59.551 --> 00:32:00.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- with those
things as well and just going

00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:01.987 align:middle line:84%
online and taking Iodoral
and all those things.

00:32:01.987 --> 00:32:05.557 align:middle line:84%
To be completely
safe, just a Kelp,

00:32:05.557 --> 00:32:06.958 align:middle line:90%
really clean Icelandic Kelp.

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Icelandic Kelp.

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:09.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:10.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK, that's good.

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Because you want
it to be clean, you know?

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's-- OK.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.365 align:middle line:90%
Icelandic Kelp, all right.

00:32:13.365 --> 00:32:14.833 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: So, Icelandic Kelp,

00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:16.468 align:middle line:84%
any kind of seaweed extracts
there is a product called Sea

00:32:16.468 --> 00:32:19.771 align:middle line:84%
Clear that's got a whole bunch
of different sea vegetables

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:22.674 align:middle line:84%
that have been fermented, too,
so you've got probiotics

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.009 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
minerals going on.

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:25.844 align:middle line:90%
So, this is like a safe one.

00:32:25.844 --> 00:32:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course then you
can kind of experiment

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.783 align:middle line:84%
with nascent iodine and with
potassium iodide.

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:33.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And what was
that-- potassium iodide, yes.

00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:35.787 align:middle line:90%
So, you can do both of those.

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.323 align:middle line:84%
But that's a little
bit more I think--

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:39.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:40.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- individual,
you know, I wouldn't--

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:41.826 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, the Kelp is
already a full spectrum?

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:42.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:43.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The Iceland
Kelp is that the same?

00:32:43.862 --> 00:32:44.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Exactly.

00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:45.697 align:middle line:84%
It gives-- it's natural
as a whole food.

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:46.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:48.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: You're not going to
go wrong with whole food.

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:49.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it's
not that expensive.

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:50.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Exactly.

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:51.102 align:middle line:84%
It's not that expensive
and it's very easy to find.

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: It's
very easy to find.

00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So, you got that for iodine
and also you need something

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:84%
for your potassium because
that's what the body, you know,

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:84%
needs and they obviously
in that.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.916 align:middle line:84%
So, that's CC137, that's
the predominant pollutant

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:05.917 align:middle line:90%
from Fukushima.

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that
gets into your body

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.655 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
enough potassium and--

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And starts
taking up as potassium.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:12.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:13.324 align:middle line:90%
And the potassium--

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:14.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- and sodium
has to be in balance as well.

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:18.997 align:middle line:84%
So, it's like it's
a very fine balance.

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:22.434 align:middle line:84%
I really like just doing
a lot of celery juice,

00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:26.104 align:middle line:84%
an organic sodium that
helps you absorb potassium

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
from like sea salts
and other things.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.707 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:31.342 align:middle line:90%
So, that's again an easy fix.

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But it's celery
>> Volynsky:juice.ly easy but--

00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:33.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- you know
like making-- exactly.

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:34.779 align:middle line:90%
It's freshly pressed--

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:35.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:33:35.547 --> 00:33:36.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: -- celery juice.

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:37.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:38.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: Not something
that's been stored

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Excellent.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: -- for a while.

00:33:40.452 --> 00:33:41.286 align:middle line:84%
Those are something very
easy that everyone can do.

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:42.754 align:middle line:90%
Celery is an amazing food

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.756 align:middle line:84%
in general. I mean we're not
getting enough organic minerals.

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So, that's a
really good way of doing that.

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:48.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I like that
approach because it's not

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:49.694 align:middle line:84%
like everything costs
you, you know,

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:51.096 align:middle line:84%
a couple of hundred
dollars a pop.

00:33:51.096 --> 00:33:53.164 align:middle line:84%
And there are some beautiful
things out there that do--

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:54.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: It was
a beautiful product.

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:55.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- the apple
pectin that you're talking

00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:58.036 align:middle line:84%
about that particular one is
expensive, it's hard to get

00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:00.205 align:middle line:84%
because it's coming out
Poland still, right?

00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:00.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:01.639 align:middle line:90%
That's-- and--

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:02.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That one source.

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- and
it's also, you know,

00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:06.044 align:middle line:84%
there's a special solubility
package on that so it goes--

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: At what package?

00:34:07.878 --> 00:34:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- it's
called solubility package

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.483 align:middle line:84%
that they make it
soluble so a lot of--

00:34:11.483 --> 00:34:12.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Soluble, OK.

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:13.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- apple pectins
are not soluble so they--

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:14.686 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I see.

00:34:14.686 --> 00:34:15.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- they're
not working

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:16.354 align:middle line:90%
as effective but this one does.

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:17.588 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:18.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So, this
one doesn't just stay

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.558 align:middle line:84%
in your intestinal track.
Apparently it can cross the

00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:23.194 align:middle line:84%
barrier and go into the body
and pull those heavy metals

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:25.195 align:middle line:84%
and radioactive particles,
you know.

00:34:25.195 --> 00:34:26.463 align:middle line:90%
This is the new research--

00:34:26.463 --> 00:34:28.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And everybody
has to look at their own--

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:31.436 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at your
own budget, your own ability

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:33.238 align:middle line:84%
to do these things
but the information

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:34.371 align:middle line:90%
on that will be on your website.

00:34:34.371 --> 00:34:35.173 align:middle line:90%
All these things--

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:36.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Absolutely.

00:34:36.307 --> 00:34:37.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- will
be on your website.

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:39.677 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And they're
in your book as well.

00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:40.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: And thre are so
many different... for each

00:34:40.945 --> 00:34:41.813 align:middle line:84%
person that has lots of
different solutions--

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:42.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- you
know, like you just have

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.449 align:middle line:90%
to pick one that is affordable--

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:34:45.617 --> 00:34:46.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- that
you can do everyday,

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:49.154 align:middle line:84%
that is within your
lifestyle and just do it.

00:34:49.154 --> 00:34:49.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:51.021 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're going
to do another clip here.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.291 align:middle line:90%
And in this particular one,

00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:54.759 align:middle line:84%
we're going to John Douillard
who I spoke

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.961 align:middle line:84%
with a couple of days ago as
well and most people know him

00:34:56.961 --> 00:35:00.231 align:middle line:84%
because of his work in sacred
geometry but he is very,

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:01.132 align:middle line:84%
very active when it
comes to the world

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:03.902 align:middle line:90%
of restoring health as well.

00:35:03.902 --> 00:35:04.936 align:middle line:90%
Behind the scenes, a lot

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:06.571 align:middle line:84%
of people don't know
about his work there.

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:10.008 align:middle line:84%
But just as you found this
apple pectin out of Poland,

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:13.144 align:middle line:84%
Hungary started responding
to the problems of Chernobyl

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.312 align:middle line:90%
for their citizens as well.

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:17.182 align:middle line:84%
And they made some
discoveries having to do

00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:20.885 align:middle line:84%
with these Earth minerals
particularly humic acid

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:21.986 align:middle line:90%
and folic acid.

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:24.389 align:middle line:84%
So, let's go to this
piece from John Douillard.

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:27.859 align:middle line:84%
>> John Douillard: When
Chernobyl happened,

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:30.795 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that radiation
came into Hungary.

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:34.132 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they shifted
their attention to try

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:38.503 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to
heal this problem.

00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:41.206 align:middle line:84%
And they found that it was
humic acid and folic acid

00:35:41.206 --> 00:35:46.878 align:middle line:84%
that was the key to
this for Hungary.

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:49.948 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:35:49.948 --> 00:35:54.919 align:middle line:84%
I mean it solved their problem
but we were not able to use

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:59.057 align:middle line:84%
that data, that information,
anywhere else in the world.

00:35:59.057 --> 00:36:02.227 align:middle line:84%
They just-- nobody like the
United States will not allow it.

00:36:02.227 --> 00:36:05.597 align:middle line:84%
That has to be come
out of Hungary.

00:36:05.597 --> 00:36:10.401 align:middle line:90%
So, this is the best thing

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:13.071 align:middle line:84%
that I have ever found
is humic and folic acid.

00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, even if
it's a bad source,

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.042 align:middle line:84%
its chelation abilities
are still very good.

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:21.613 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I find that one
really interesting as well

00:36:21.613 --> 00:36:24.182 align:middle line:84%
and of course in Sedona a lot
of people are aware of this

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:90%
and take these various there--

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.517 align:middle line:84%
there are different
people that formulated

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.286 align:middle line:90%
in these various products.

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:30.021 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like John Douillard
was able to talk the Hungarians

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:34.359 align:middle line:84%
into giving him the very
specific ingredients needed

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:35.893 align:middle line:90%
so he can formulate.

00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:38.429 align:middle line:84%
So, there's another that we can
go with and that seems to be--

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:39.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- well researched.

00:36:40.098 --> 00:36:41.099 align:middle line:90%
It's a quality one.

00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:42.233 align:middle line:84%
And that is again
chelates the heavy metals

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:43.234 align:middle line:90%
out of the body as well.

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:44.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:46.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So, that's good.

00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:48.873 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the part of the
story that we really don't talk

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:52.043 align:middle line:84%
about is the consciousness
aspect of it

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:54.579 align:middle line:84%
because what's happening
is the people that do know

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:58.316 align:middle line:84%
about radiation exposure
tend to go in mass.

00:36:58.316 --> 00:37:00.852 align:middle line:84%
We tend to go into fear over
it thinking, "Oh my God.

00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:03.354 align:middle line:84%
My life is going
to be shortened."

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:07.558 align:middle line:84%
But again, from a metaphysical
point of view, life is much more

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:90%
than just exposure to toxins.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.164 align:middle line:84%
People are able to survive
insurmountable types

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:15.533 align:middle line:90%
of obstacles that seems--

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:16.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Absolutely.

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:17.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- and live
to be ripe old ages.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:20.104 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about
the consciousness part

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:24.742 align:middle line:84%
from your perspective and then
we're going to have a little--

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:27.745 align:middle line:84%
lets see into it, Patrick and
Adam feel about it as well.

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.148 align:middle line:84%
That's actually part of
my protocol, you know,

00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:33.051 align:middle line:84%
we got to remove and
immunolize repair,

00:37:33.051 --> 00:37:36.921 align:middle line:84%
you can to do repair your DNA
as well because antioxidants,

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.257 align:middle line:84%
this one is very easy, everyone
knows about antioxidants.

00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:41.659 align:middle line:84%
And the last one is the
calibration, that's how I call

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:43.628 align:middle line:84%
and that's the conscious
piece, recalibration.

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:44.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Recalibration.

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:46.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So,
recalibrating your body,

00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:48.866 align:middle line:84%
your energetic body,
your spirit.

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:53.571 align:middle line:84%
Because its massive amounts of
energy, you know, in radiation

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:54.872 align:middle line:84%
when there's radioactive
particles,

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:58.042 align:middle line:84%
it can literally shift
your energetic body.

00:37:58.042 --> 00:38:01.346 align:middle line:84%
I do work with GDV
which is a Russian--

00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:02.647 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Konstantin Korotkov.

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:03.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: -- technology.

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:05.116 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I've interviewed
him with this.

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:07.085 align:middle line:84%
If anyone wants to take
a look in the archives

00:38:07.085 --> 00:38:09.153 align:middle line:84%
under Konstantin Korotkov,
that's in the CNN archives.

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yes.

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:12.023 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend
checking this one out.

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:13.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: And so, I
have one of those cameras

00:38:14.192 --> 00:38:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and I always check things--

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Of course.

00:38:17.195 --> 00:38:18.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: I'm curious.
I'm curious cat.

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:20.064 align:middle line:84%
So, I did see that people
that are more expose

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:24.135 align:middle line:84%
to radiation had their
energetic body shifting.

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:27.572 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same, there's
a whole bunch of raggedness,

00:38:27.572 --> 00:38:29.173 align:middle line:84%
there's holes and
it's not as full.

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:34.645 align:middle line:84%
So, it does affect the body
but then what I was looking at,

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:37.115 align:middle line:84%
what will shift the
energetic body?

00:38:37.115 --> 00:38:42.754 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, positive thinking,
you know, little tools

00:38:42.754 --> 00:38:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that you can use like
heart math monitor

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.893 align:middle line:84%
so you should basically
doing breathing, Pranayama.

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:51.729 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
were rapidly filling

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:54.966 align:middle line:84%
out the energetic body
right after the exposure.

00:38:54.966 --> 00:38:56.934 align:middle line:90%
Same as their negative thoughts.

00:38:56.934 --> 00:39:00.371 align:middle line:84%
If the person continued being
in fear, and being stressed,

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:84%
you know, stressing out
for the next 15 minutes,

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.674 align:middle line:90%
it was getting worse.

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:06.043 align:middle line:84%
It was not, you know,
getting any better.

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:09.247 align:middle line:84%
So, it start me thinking on this
whole conscious part how is our

00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:84%
thinking and our state
of emotions are going

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.254 align:middle line:84%
to effect our physical body and
how we can transform ourselves

00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:19.424 align:middle line:84%
without even using
supplements just by the power

00:39:19.424 --> 00:39:22.427 align:middle line:90%
of our spirit and our thoughts?

00:39:22.427 --> 00:39:24.162 align:middle line:90%
So, that being like a big part

00:39:24.162 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
of my research, and
that's what excites me

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:30.101 align:middle line:84%
that you can't do that, it
can affect your physicality

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:33.304 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
around you just as that.

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:37.175 align:middle line:84%
And the interest thing also
was that it get me thinking

00:39:37.175 --> 00:39:40.344 align:middle line:84%
about this as when I was
researching low levels

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:43.080 align:middle line:90%
of radiation, there was a lot

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.117 align:middle line:84%
of study showing how it is
read negative on the body

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:48.052 align:middle line:84%
and how this is like-- all
these horrible things happening

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.587 align:middle line:84%
but then there's a whole
bunch of research showing

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:52.089 align:middle line:84%
that the people getting
over cancer

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:55.393 align:middle line:84%
and they were getting all
sort of powers, you know.

00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:57.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's true.

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:59.897 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a Russian woman
a few years ago named Elena

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:05.536 align:middle line:84%
Tonetti-Vladimirova again go
the CMN Archives at Gaiam.

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:08.005 align:middle line:90%
I did a full interview with her.

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:13.344 align:middle line:84%
She was raised near a
leaking reactor in Siberia.

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:17.482 align:middle line:84%
Half the people thrived and
the other half had mutations

00:40:17.482 --> 00:40:19.183 align:middle line:84%
in their offspring
and were sick.

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:21.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: So-- yeah, I
could totally see that--

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Because--

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:23.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: -- depending
from studies

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.022 align:middle line:84%
so it's started me
thinking of, "OK.

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:26.624 align:middle line:84%
So, you got all these
energy happening,

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:27.892 align:middle line:84%
you even got this
radioactive particle,

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:28.893 align:middle line:90%
with all these energy, right?

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:30.495 align:middle line:90%
Because it's charge particle.

00:40:30.495 --> 00:40:33.464 align:middle line:84%
If you thought direction
isn't a positive, you know,

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:36.601 align:middle line:90%
place and you got your spirit

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.836 align:middle line:84%
like positive recharging
forward.

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:41.906 align:middle line:84%
You can actually might suddenly
transform your physiology

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:43.207 align:middle line:90%
for the better.

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:43.841 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:44.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Right?

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And not only that.

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:47.345 align:middle line:84%
We're having more extreme
exposures to radiation

00:40:47.345 --> 00:40:50.915 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, this is
coming in for purpose.

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:84%
None of this is an accident
so to speak because--

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: It is not.

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:55.953 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of evolution of the
fittest in a way, you know.

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:58.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, on
that note, in fact--

00:40:58.723 --> 00:40:59.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Yeah.

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:01.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- this
is a good time to go

00:41:01.259 --> 00:41:02.894 align:middle line:84%
to Patrick's statement on
exactly what you're just saying.

00:41:02.894 --> 00:41:04.529 align:middle line:84%
So, we're going to listen to
Patrick but we're also before

00:41:04.529 --> 00:41:06.998 align:middle line:84%
that going to hear Adam
Chambley.

00:41:06.998 --> 00:41:08.232 align:middle line:84%
That event, he was
talking about in Aspen,

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:10.868 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
over 100 mile area.

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:13.237 align:middle line:84%
He was just a physician
in Aspen.

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:17.041 align:middle line:84%
Something very interesting
happened after that.

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:20.244 align:middle line:84%
The second half of that
story when he started looking

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:24.315 align:middle line:84%
at the higher, more
spiritual aspect of working

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:29.053 align:middle line:84%
with the quantum field and
radiation and consciousness

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:30.855 align:middle line:90%
so let's go to that piece.

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:32.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Adam Chambley: We need
to see some thing happen.

00:41:32.423 --> 00:41:35.826 align:middle line:90%
We need an intervention here.

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:38.563 align:middle line:84%
And people say things
to me like, "What?

00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:39.897 align:middle line:90%
Why would you?

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:42.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah, I'm a scientist."

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So, I relate to the
infinite field of radiation

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.572 align:middle line:84%
that every other molecule
has been absolutely proven

00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:50.408 align:middle line:90%
to be a modification of finally

00:41:50.408 --> 00:41:53.578 align:middle line:84%
by the Higgs-Boson I mean
the way before that it was.

00:41:53.578 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I relate to this
field personally

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:05.022 align:middle line:84%
and so this field is not just a
field, it's a conscious being,

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.757 align:middle line:90%
it's a conscious awareness.

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.292 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds
of expressions

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:11.596 align:middle line:84%
of conscious awareness and
I don't even know, you know,

00:42:11.596 --> 00:42:15.199 align:middle line:84%
I'm not necessarily addressing
people by name, you know,

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:18.569 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying, this
needs to change now.

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:20.504 align:middle line:90%
We know how to change this.

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:22.173 align:middle line:90%
We know this is all mutable,

00:42:22.173 --> 00:42:25.376 align:middle line:84%
this is all phantasmagoric
even the radio isotopes.

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:29.413 align:middle line:84%
We have to have faith
but not stupid faith,

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:30.881 align:middle line:90%
not an informed faith.

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:33.184 align:middle line:90%
We have to have faith.

00:42:33.184 --> 00:42:36.253 align:middle line:84%
And actually incarnating,
as human beings,

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:38.623 align:middle line:84%
in a way that we
haven't yet incarnated.

00:42:38.623 --> 00:42:41.892 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, all I can
tell you is that from 3o'clock

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:44.762 align:middle line:84%
in the morning until 7:30
in the morning when we woke

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:49.367 align:middle line:84%
up feeling completely different
than we've had for several days.

00:42:49.367 --> 00:42:53.638 align:middle line:84%
My meter which was actually
on a stool by the bed

00:42:53.638 --> 00:42:55.339 align:middle line:84%
which should been
all red at 3o'clock

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:59.944 align:middle line:84%
in the morning was not
only reduced to normal,

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:02.880 align:middle line:90%
it was half of what normal was.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Not only that but the
soil samples were clean.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:07.918 align:middle line:84%
So, the air was clean,
the soil was clean,

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:11.222 align:middle line:84%
and then for scientifically
speaking, you know,

00:43:11.222 --> 00:43:13.491 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to happen.

00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:21.465 align:middle line:84%
You know, this was actually
you could call it a miracle.

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:25.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then Patrick
also talks about his experience

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:29.907 align:middle line:84%
and what he feels is happening
with radiation and our DNA.

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:32.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Chambley: Our
DNA is changing.

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.878 align:middle line:90%
It does evolve.

00:43:33.878 --> 00:43:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
DNA is a super conductor.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.422 align:middle line:90%
It's an antenna.

00:43:44.422 --> 00:43:49.694 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the radiation
can possibly stimulate genes

00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:53.397 align:middle line:90%
that we don't even know about

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:59.537 align:middle line:84%
and possibly even change the
number of strands on our DNA.

00:43:59.537 --> 00:44:03.307 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of speculation
and that maybe the case.

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:06.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What intrigued
me about that statement

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:09.113 align:middle line:84%
from him was when I
mentioned a moment ago is

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:12.249 align:middle line:84%
that we are also being
exposed to this increase

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:15.653 align:middle line:84%
in cosmic radiation at this
incredible time in history

00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:17.488 align:middle line:90%
when the species does appear

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:23.260 align:middle line:84%
to be making a leap forward both
genetically and spiritually.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.364 align:middle line:84%
So, I find all that--
all of it fascinating.

00:44:26.364 --> 00:44:28.699 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we should be
careless and not take care--

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:29.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Volynsky: Absolutely.

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:30.368 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:30.368 --> 00:44:31.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- of the
physical components

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:32.369 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of toxic exposure.

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.472 align:middle line:84%
So, on that note,
Katrine, what--

00:44:34.472 --> 00:44:38.008 align:middle line:84%
give us any final thoughts
on the subject about all

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:41.445 align:middle line:84%
of us being exposed to
radiation now that you would

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:44.482 align:middle line:84%
like to before we end
this show?

00:44:44.482 --> 00:44:46.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Volynsky: It's an
invitation to evolve.

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.152 align:middle line:90%
To--

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:49.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: To evolve.
