00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
It's been said

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:10%
that if you can manipulate
a person's blood,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:10%
you can manipulate the person.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:10%
Thankfully, this can be
done to excellent effect.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:10%
Medical renegade Harvey Bigelsen
has been looking at, analyzing,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:10%
and healing people by
getting to know their blood.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the first
in the United States

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:84%
to utilize dark field microscopy
in his medical practice.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:84%
What the blood showed
him was nothing short

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
of a holographic representation
of the medical and even

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.420 align:middle line:90%
emotional history of the person.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:84%
The field of live
blood analysis is now

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:84%
crowded with practitioners
of every sort,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
but Harvey says there's
a qualitative difference

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:84%
between garden variety
analysis and the esoteric truth

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
behind the reality of what's
going on inside of us.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It took Harvey many years to
understand the story of blood,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
which he documented in his
book, "Holographic Blood."

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:90%
And Harvey's with us today.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Harvey.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY BIGELSEN:
I'm glad to be here.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's good
to see you again.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
We've already had a couple
interviews through the years

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.381 align:middle line:84%
But the nice thing is your
work continues to expand.

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And for the people that
aren't familiar with it,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I want to go ahead and
go back to the beginning

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:90%
of the story a bit.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you say there is
a fundamental platform

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:90%
that has to be understood.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There was, I think
it was called,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
"Divided Legacy," a book
written called "Divided Legacy,"

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.944 align:middle line:84%
saying there were two basic
philosophies in healing.

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you'll start
there, then we

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:84%
can start moving
in through blood.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: Basically,
it really goes back

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.495 align:middle line:10%
to Hippocrates and Galen.

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:10%
It goes back that far.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:10%
There are two
basic philosophies.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:10%
Number one, you look at the body
as a whole, working unit, that

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:10%
may be working with
all its parts working.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Or the other way is something
is coming in and damaging

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And these two competing
thoughts, philosophies,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
have gone on for
centuries and centuries.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's brought us up to
the germ theory of disease,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.994 align:middle line:84%
which I have major
questions about.

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you do.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you're
dealing in very avant-garde

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:90%
areas of germs therapy, even.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
People hear that and it's
like, ooh, "germ therapy."

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, here
we are, everywhere

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.815 align:middle line:84%
you go you have this--
what is that disinfectant.

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh, sanitizers.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sanitizers
for your hands, and ooh,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:84%
don't let the baby crawl on
the ground, and all that.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about germs and
Louis Pasteur, what he brought,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.495 align:middle line:84%
and everything right to
the very-- on his death

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:84%
bed, what he had
to say about it.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, first
of all, very interesting

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:10%
is, number one, we are a bundle
of germs that have basically

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:10%
organized over evolution
to create a body.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.795 align:middle line:10%
But basically, every
cell is a separate germ.

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We're a germ bag.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.935 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: We're a germ bag.

00:03:02.935 --> 00:03:03.434 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:90%
So germs are not harmful.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
The creator didn't make a
whole-- evolution, however

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:84%
you want to look at it, didn't
make anything to beat you up.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything is made to be
in harmony with each other.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
As evolution has gone on,
we've been in harmony.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
As the Earth has changed, man
has changed and adapted to it.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Nature is not fighting us.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:90%
This is what goes on.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, Pasteur.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Coming back up to the
late 19th century,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.477 align:middle line:84%
Louis Pasteur becomes
very, very famous.

00:03:34.477 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:84%
He comes up with the
germ theory of disease,

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:90%
that germs cause disease.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
His rival, Antoine
Bechamp, said no, germs

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:90%
live in a diseased body.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Pasteur, though, his
whole concept really

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:84%
explodes wide open
with Rockefeller,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.532 align:middle line:84%
who sponsors the germ
theory of disease.

00:03:50.532 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk about
that-- the political reasons

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.455 align:middle line:84%
why Pasteur's theory
won out over Bechamp.

00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: OK.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
At the turn of the
century-- that's

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting
philosophy on it.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
At the turn the
century in history,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
there were five different
types of health schools.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
By the year 1910, Rockefeller
decides to spend his money

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and back the chemical
industry, start

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:90%
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.299 align:middle line:84%
And all the other
schools, by 1947,

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.465 align:middle line:84%
in the homeopathic schools--
Flower and Fifth Avenue

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and Hahnemann
Homeopathic School--

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.752 align:middle line:90%
they become medical schools.

00:04:24.752 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
All the other schools
lost their charter,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and everything becomes
medical schools.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.223 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now, what were
the-- besides homeopathy--

00:04:30.223 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
which my understanding
is it was more than 40%

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
of the medical schools
were homeopathic up

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.307 align:middle line:84%
to that time-- what were some of
the other modalities of schools

00:04:38.307 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:90%
that were available?

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: There
was naturopathy.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.875 align:middle line:84%
There was a structural
type of school.

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Osteopathy?

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.209 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Osteopathy, that
doesn't come on till later on.

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Till later, OK.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: But still,
people were questioning that.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.825 align:middle line:90%
They were looking at that.

00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Why is this body not working?

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.211 align:middle line:90%
Naturopathy was a big one.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of herbal stuff
that was done at that time,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:90%
because that was man and nature.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.021 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So we had a plethora
of what now would

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
be called "alternative
medical schools."

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
But they were actually
primary medical schools.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you take and
synthesize nature's herbs,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
turn them into
drugs, which is now

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:84%
called primary, which should
be secondary for sure.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:90%
That should be the alternative.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's see what
happened politically then.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, first
of all, Rockefeller

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
decides-- he sponsored
the industry.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, Rockefeller
dies the age of 94

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:84%
with never taking a drug in his
life, and homeopathic physician

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.804 align:middle line:90%
attendants.

00:05:31.804 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
was a vegetarian.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, and he was
a vegetarian all his life.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:90%
This it tells you a big story.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is money.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.958 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It's all
money, money, money.

00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the name of the game.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on now, it's
all the name of the game.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:90%
It's money, money, money.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.935 align:middle line:84%
It's pharmaceutical industry
controlling everything.

00:05:46.935 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back
to that story, it

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
was convenient, then, for
them to adopt the germ theory,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.531 align:middle line:84%
because you can throw an
alternative pharmaceutical drug

00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:90%
at it.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.696 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: If you
have the germ theory,

00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
you can have the
magic bullet theory.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Plain and simple.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So we've developed
magic bullets.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.094 align:middle line:84%
Now the name of the
game is the name.

00:06:07.094 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
You go into the doctor,
they work you up over there.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
They come up with
all these tests,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.195 align:middle line:90%
and they put a name on you.

00:06:12.195 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:90%
They put a name on you.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:90%
You've got a disease name.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Now they can open
up a drawer and look

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.060 align:middle line:84%
at what should be done
with that disease.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.910 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- Regina Meredith
is the only person like her

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't fit into a drawer.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.829 align:middle line:90%
It's as basic as that.

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:27.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:28.703 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: It's that simple.

00:06:28.703 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so
Pasteur, as I recall,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
recanted on his deathbed
and said he was wrong.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.812 align:middle line:84%
Didn't change the nature of
what was going on politically

00:06:36.812 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
medicine, though, did it?

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.145 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No.

00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
No, Pasteur definitely
recanted on it.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But Rockefeller--
it was the money

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:90%
that overwhelmed everything.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Which is really what's
going on in society.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Money overwhelms everything.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And Rockefeller
just bought it out.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.101 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So now, some people listening
to this might be thinking, yeah,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:84%
but our life spans
were only what, 45?

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:90%
45 to 50, maybe 100 years ago.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, people would die
of an infection of some kind.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But that point is still--
that's still not the point.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
The point is that person had
a terrain of unhealthy blood.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: That's
exactly right.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:90%
It's unhealthy blood.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
First of all, people talk about,
well, we're living longer.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it must
be the system.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
This is just evolution
that we're living longer.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with the system.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:84%
The United States ranks 37th by
the World Health Organization

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
in longevity, which is
absolutely incredible.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
We think we're so
great, but there

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
are countries in
Ethiopia and stuff

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
like that, Oman, that are
living much longer than us.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's just this
whole concept of taking

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:84%
all of this medicine
and all these poisons

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're taking
all of these poisons.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's really what they are.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Pick up a pharmaceutical label.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Try to read it.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:90%
See what it says in it.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Try to pronounce
the words sometimes

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the
generics on it over there.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is all done with
what I call smoke and mirrors.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
The bigger and
fancier it is, it's

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:90%
got to be the best there is.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the
creation was simple.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.785 align:middle line:90%
Life is simple.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
They purposely do this to
cloud you, to overwhelm.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
You can't understand
these four-syllable words.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%
That's intentionally designed.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about this,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
because you have a real bone--
I know that I've introduced you

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:84%
before as an alternative
medical practitioner,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:90%
even though you're an MD.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:90%
And you say, no.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
no for a purpose,

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:90%
and I alluded to that earlier.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.770 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, "alternative"
means, basically, they're

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.947 align:middle line:10%
primary and I'm secondary.

00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:10%
And I look at it the
other way around.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.113 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Shouldn't
nature be primary?

00:08:44.113 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: Totally.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:10%
1,000%.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:10%
Number one--
they're alternative.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I look at myself as
primary, because I

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:90%
take the whole package into it.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:84%
They're taking only
one aspect into it.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:90%
They're alternative.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:90%
I can integrate them.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.814 align:middle line:90%
They can't integrate me.

00:08:58.814 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't throw out, necessarily,
the pharmaceuticals.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't throw out the
baby with the bathwater.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it needs
to save your life,

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
like crisis medicine
and stuff like that.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.296 align:middle line:84%
But all this stuff to take
for Lyme disease and things.

00:09:09.296 --> 00:09:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Take this medicine for
the rest of your life.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
You're hypertensive,
take this medicine

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.965 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:09:13.965 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:84%
An they give you these
foreign chemicals.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.176 align:middle line:90%
Watch out for the side effects.

00:09:18.176 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Number one, there's no such
thing as a side effect.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.841 align:middle line:84%
I put something in
your mouth, you're

00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:90%
going to have a direct effect.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:90%
It's as basic as that.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:84%
They tell you, 3% of the
people who have heart attacks

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:90%
take this.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:90%
You've got a 3% chance.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple on it.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're so snookered
by the industry.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.545 align:middle line:84%
We watch TV and you
hear the commercials.

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And always in the prime
time, the commercials

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.055 align:middle line:84%
with a beautiful girl
dancing through the forest.

00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And she's got this
horrendous illness.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:84%
But if she takes this,
she's doing so nice.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.155 align:middle line:84%
But side effects are
death, homicide, suicide.

00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to- well,
we won't get into that.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.356 align:middle line:84%
That's a different
political discussion.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
But we know the harmful
effects, side effects,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
effects of this
psychologically as well as

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.980 align:middle line:84%
physically in a
lot of these drugs.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.944 align:middle line:90%
So Bechamp was correct.

00:10:05.944 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Disease happens
in a diseased body,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:90%
in a diseased terrain.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about that.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into some--
we'll go into cancer

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and the whole notion
of adaptations of molds

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and viruses and bacterias,
one to another, and so forth.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's
just talk about blood.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:84%
What you started finding, and
when you started this field,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:90%
what led you to it.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And what you started
seeing as a story emerging

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.091 align:middle line:90%
through people's blood.

00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, it
was a number of years

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
ago-- it had to probably
be about 25, 30 years ago

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
now-- that I was sponsored
by a private foundation

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
to go through Europe and
halfway around the world

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
to see what everyone
else is doing.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up
outside of Montreal,

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
a French Canadian physicist's
little laboratory.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And he had a microscope
that magnified 30,000 times.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.725 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to do that.

00:10:57.725 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
But I've never seen
anything like that,

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.865 align:middle line:90%
that he built this thing.

00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And what he showed us,
he took a drop of blood.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.407 align:middle line:84%
We looked at it
under the microscope.

00:11:06.407 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And right then and there,
the moment I put my hand

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
on the microscope, goosebumps
broke out all over my body.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Chills broke out.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
There were things
moving in the blood

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that there were no name
for in American literature.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I got so excited, it
just overwhelmed me.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Basic.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.060 align:middle line:84%
The blood is the
basis to everything.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the connection.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:90%
The basis to everything.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet there are
things living there

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that have never been
seen by American doctors.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.617 align:middle line:84%
Americans, what they do
is you go to a doctor

00:11:35.617 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:90%
and they do a blood test on you.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.735 align:middle line:84%
What they do is
they take the blood

00:11:38.735 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:90%
and they stain it to look at it.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, that stain kills
anything it picks it up.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:90%
It fixes it from mortality.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.481 align:middle line:84%
So 10 years from now, they
can take out Regina's blood,

00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:90%
look at the slide.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
also not looking

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:90%
at living blood by then.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
They're missing the
forest for the trees.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
When I saw the living blood
and saw those things moving--

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm only the
third doctor in US history

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:90%
to look at the blood live.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered the same things
that the other two discovered

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:84%
How can you go to medical
school, or 100 years

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of medicine, and no one has
looked at a drop of blood

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and tell you what these little
things are that are moving?

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.657 align:middle line:84%
They remind me of the moron that
lost a quarter on a dark night,

00:12:19.657 --> 00:12:21.281 align:middle line:84%
was looking two blocks
down the street,

00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:22.957 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the street lamp is.

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:23.791 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a good analogy.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, now,
we have a common fondness

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:90%
for someone.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1980s, I was running
around with a camera in Europe,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
trying to find all
the avant-garde

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:90%
physicists slash physicians.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.135 align:middle line:84%
And microscopy was part of it,
the Ergonom 400, which was big.

00:12:43.135 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh,
Bernard Muschlein.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bernard Muschlein was
working with Kurt Olbrich, who

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
was the-- he was the
developer of the Ergonom.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But all they were trying
to do is recapture

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
what Rife had already done.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
Rife's microscopes

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
had reportedly been
destroyed or spirited away.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were
looking at that time,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
about the time
you're talking about.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Bernard must have been one of
the very first in the world

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.767 align:middle line:84%
to look at AIDS and cancer
cells and such under this field.

00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Bernard,
he was actually--

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.308 align:middle line:84%
when I was sponsored by
the private foundation,

00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
he was the first
one we went to see.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.655 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, he
didn't have a microscope.

00:13:18.655 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:90%
But we were into the philosophy.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.526 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
was even before.

00:13:21.526 --> 00:13:23.871 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: That was
before he had a microscope.

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But he started to tell
us, OK, now from here,

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go and look
at this type of thing.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:84%
He was into the
whole philosophy.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:84%
He sent us to laboratories,
he sent us to other people

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.407 align:middle line:90%
so we can start to communicate.

00:13:38.407 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
what he was showing me--

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
because that was at the
time, the anemoscope,

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:90%
they killed the inventor.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:10%
The government stole it.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.941 align:middle line:10%
Kurt's microscope, the Ergonom
400, was really all there was.

00:13:49.941 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:10%
For all I know, it's still
being used in universities.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.787 align:middle line:10%
I know that they were able to--

00:13:53.787 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: I think it is.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.828 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --license it.

00:13:55.828 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But I was shocked when
I looked at these cells

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:90%
at 30,000, 40,000 magnification.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw is the very thing
that you were talking about.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know you then, and no
one else was talking about it.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was watching
what many call a mutation,

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:90%
but you say an adaptation.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Totally different.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cells that were
adapting from one form,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
from a bacteria to
a mold to a virus,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:90%
or whatever order it was in.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So please explain some
of that, and what's

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:90%
happening in our blood.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And this whole ability of
these other mechanisms,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
these little organisms, to
adapt and become cancerous,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.354 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:14:33.354 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: Well,
germs are constantly--

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:10%
everything is always
adapting in society.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:10%
If I have a stagnant
pond, and I have

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:10%
sterile water of a stagnant
pond, Give me a week or so,

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:10%
and you'll start to see
things growing in there.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:84%
This was distilled,
sterile water.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.336 align:middle line:90%
And then they'll change.

00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:84%
First you'll see little
things moving around,

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.090 align:middle line:84%
then you'll see
germs moving around.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And the more it sits there,
the germs become bigger

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:90%
and they become fungi.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is a constant
change at the beginning.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happens to a human.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:90%
We're a bundle of germs.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, as we
get out of line,

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:90%
bacteria will tend to grow.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the first term.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, chronic
disease will start

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.014 align:middle line:84%
to come in, which
is fungal in nature.

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:17.096 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All chronic
disease is fungal in nature?

00:15:17.096 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: All chronic
disease is fungal in nature.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And this includes cancers?

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Cancer is a mold.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a fungus; it's mold.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're not
the only person saying this,

00:15:27.478 --> 00:15:27.981 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: It's a mold.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
When they gave women
hormonal therapy

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
for menopause and hormonal
therapy for hot flashes,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
then they gave 'em
calcium for osteoporosis,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.242 align:middle line:84%
they skyrocketed breast
cancer because breast cancer

00:15:40.242 --> 00:15:43.320 align:middle line:84%
loves to-- the mold
for breast cancer loves

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:90%
to feed on calcium in the bones.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.685 align:middle line:90%
The mold loves the calcium.

00:15:47.685 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It
loves the calcium.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they paired them.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.223 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They
paired them together.

00:15:51.223 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Breast cancer will metastasize
to 20 spots in the bones

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
first without ever going
to the lungs or the liver,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
but it's never gone to
the intestines ever.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.830 align:middle line:10%
And what they say
is, cancer, what

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:10%
happens, the way it spreads,
is one cell breaks off,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:10%
gets onto a capillary, and
spreads around, and sort of

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:10%
implants itself
someplace randomly.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.722 align:middle line:10%
Nature is not random.

00:16:16.722 --> 00:16:19.145 align:middle line:10%
That whole concept of
nature being random,

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:10%
no, there's no such
thing as random things.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I can predict cancer
on patients just

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:84%
by measuring the pHs
of their oxygen levels.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Because cancer, it's a mold.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
A mold grows when
there's poor oxygen.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And the pH of the
blood, pH is alkaline.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.384 align:middle line:84%
When we're stressed out, now
the mold can start to grow.

00:16:35.384 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you
can see here we

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
have about five different
avenues of conversation that

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.484 align:middle line:90%
have just been opened up.

00:16:41.484 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Let me start with one that
might be a little more obscure,

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll go
into the more obvious.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Naturopaths also say that
the use of reishi mushrooms,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:84%
for example, in these
extracts from fungi,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
are capable of helping
reduce the cancer

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
or eliminate the
cancer in the body.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So is this really going back to
the essence of like cures like?

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.536 align:middle line:84%
Aren't we back into the
terrain of homeopathy?

00:17:04.536 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Exactly right.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what
the whole thing is.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.149 align:middle line:84%
Because those mushrooms,
they're fungi.

00:17:09.149 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what mushrooms
are, and you're

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
treating like treats like
is very, very important.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how
does introducing fungi

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:84%
into a diseased
terrain, say a terrain

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that's lacking in
oxygen, for example,

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.545 align:middle line:84%
how does that
start reversing it?

00:17:23.545 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
the mechanics of it.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:25.424 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well
first of all, you've

00:17:25.424 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
got to start to reverse
it structurally.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
All I can do is I can give you
remedies and stuff like that

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:90%
to straighten out your pHs.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But if that
structure is blocked.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.934 align:middle line:84%
To me, the greatest
American physician,

00:17:37.934 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
who was the founder
of osteopathy,

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:84%
who said "disease cannot
exist where there are no

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:90%
obstructions."

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:84%
If you've got an obstruction of
flow, you get a stagnant pond.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
And that stagnant pond happens.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: That's
the name of the game.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.496 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
an acupuncturist

00:17:50.496 --> 00:17:51.966 align:middle line:90%
would say the same thing.

00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN:
Acupuncture-- really,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:84%
we have an electrical
body that runs a physical.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Acupuncture's working with that.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But if the person really
understands the whole way

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.425 align:middle line:84%
the physical body works, you've
also got to open the structure.

00:18:02.425 --> 00:18:04.091 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now
you're talking more

00:18:04.091 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
about the nervous system,
then, and manipulation,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system,
the musculature.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It's not
just the nervous system.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the structure of
the flow, of electricity

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
stops the flow of
fluids, all of that.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you're crunched
up like this--

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All those meridians.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: --you're
tightened up like this,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
you're now stopping some of the
flows that are going through.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So your emotions
can really dictate

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot what's going on by
where you hold the tensions.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
That will start to cut
the circulation down,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and then disease, da da
da, will start to appear.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got
that circulation down.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, let's move on
from there and talk about this.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you one
more question about it,

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:90%
because I find it fascinating.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I recently interviewed someone
named Gerald Cohen, who's

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:84%
a chiropractor doctor,
but many other modalities.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.015 align:middle line:84%
Like you, spent
a lifetime at it.

00:18:55.015 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a new little
device that you

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:84%
can attach to the
side of the nose.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it oxygenates
the blood supply in the body.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
It took 14 years for
this Chinese man, Lim Lu,

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:90%
to reverse engineer it.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But it goes in and oxygenates
the blood, the bloodstream.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.885 align:middle line:90%
So what is this going to do?

00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:16.094 align:middle line:90%
In your mind, that would be--

00:19:16.094 --> 00:19:17.801 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: That's a
cancer preventative.

00:19:17.801 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Now,
our subconscious,

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
our emotion can overcome
that, try to fight that.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But if someone's doing that, and
you're being super oxygenated,

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:90%
the mold can't grow.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:90%
It's just that simple.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:90%
We live on oxygen.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:90%
We can fast for days.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop breathing.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.151 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're on, I think,
according to the World Health

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Organization, an
oxygen-deprived planet now.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.191 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting proper
oxygen supplies anymore.

00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Humans
are the only ones

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:90%
that sort of destroy the planet.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
We're the only creatures on the
planet that really almost rape

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:90%
it or take things from it.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.520 align:middle line:90%
You never see a fat deer.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.617 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
interestingly, we also look

00:19:57.617 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
at the disappearance
of other species.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:84%
If our species is being impacted
by low levels of oxygen,

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:84%
certainly it's impacting
other species as well.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going to look
at, from a technological point

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
of view, it sounds like we have
very inexpensive technology

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
coming up that'll allow us
to re-oxygenate the blood.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Which I thought sounded
just very exciting.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: To me,
life is simple.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
They make it very, very complex.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
If you think you'd
be good oxygenated,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:84%
they can implant cancer on you
and it's not going to grow.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:90%
That's as simple as that.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
If your cells are
getting the oxygen,

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:90%
they are happy as clams.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.684 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.684 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, it's
the most important thing

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
there is, is just
the way we breathe.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I work on patients
a lot and teach them

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.770 align:middle line:84%
how yoga methods of
pranayama, teach them

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.195 align:middle line:84%
how to breathe with their belly
so they get a full breath all

00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:90%
the way down into the body.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.279 align:middle line:90%
Very, very different.

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is very different.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
helpful for opening up

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those
meridians and such,

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and the various
diaphragms, of which you

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:84%
say there are actually five
diaphragms on the body.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle line:84%
But we're still breathing an
oxygen-depleted air supply.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.424 align:middle line:90%
That's what's interesting.

00:21:06.424 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: If you
go back, Edgar Cayce,

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:84%
America's most
prolific psychic, said

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
humans have been on
the planet eight times.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And it takes us a while, maybe
10,000 years, 20,000 years,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.244 align:middle line:84%
to destroy the planet
and destroy ourselves.

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And it takes another
billion years

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
for the planet to
regrow people again.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Humans are the furthest
away from God and nature

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.814 align:middle line:90%
and missing the whole ball game.

00:21:30.814 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you're
absolutely right on that.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to continue down
this one other path

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't
interviewed him yet.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
He's in Italy, and
we didn't connect

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:90%
when I was there recently.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.857 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Simoncini, Tullio Simoncini.

00:21:43.857 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh, yes.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He is
eradicating breast tumors

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
by injecting them
with sodium bicar--

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:84%
a form of sodium bicarbonate,
which is baking soda.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, how could that be?

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It's
controlling the pH.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Cancer grows when the
cells are too acid,

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and they dump alkaline waste,
and it's poor oxygenation.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.740 align:middle line:84%
What he's doing, sodium bicarb,
he's stabilizing the pH.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a real key.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:84%
We do that if someone
comes into the office

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and they have a cancer
case we're working with,

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
we will do sodium bicarb
or hydrochloric acid.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We'll measure
their pHs, and then

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.910 align:middle line:84%
use those two things in the
IVs to balance their pHs.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
If they're too acid or too
alkaline, whatever it is.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ingredients
we basically use.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
If we can keep
those pHs balanced.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
If I can have a cancer patient
that was 24 hours on an IV,

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and keep them balanced,
the cancer could not grow.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.553 align:middle line:84%
And then if I've put them
in a hyperbaric chamber--

00:22:39.553 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: --forcing the
oxygen into their body.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Hyperbaric chambers are
very, very anti-cancer.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:84%
We have them in our
office, and the patients

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:90%
come in and just lie in them.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it really works.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It slows
the cancer down.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:90%
The cancer can't live in oxygen.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Oxygen will kill cancer.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.742 align:middle line:90%
Just that simple.

00:22:59.742 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's amazing.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: I know.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And we make
everything so complex.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I think the complexity
is intentional.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:10%
It's plain intentional, to keep
the average person not knowing

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:10%
what the story is about.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:10%
They use four-syllable words
and they use those things

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:10%
intentionally so you don't
know what's going on.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
That I'm special,
because I'm a doctor,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.274 align:middle line:84%
and you really
don't know anything.

00:23:25.274 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Now let's, for a moment,
talk about something.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Which is, if you go
to a medical doctor--

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and this is a very
difficult situation.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So a person goes through, they
go through all their exams,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.428 align:middle line:84%
sure enough they find
something in there.

00:23:37.428 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a little something.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they even find that
it's become cancerous.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Now you're in the system.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Now you're probably going to
have chemoradiation or surgery

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.130 align:middle line:84%
thrown at it, all of which are
extremely damaging to the body.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, people won't go
outside the system

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:84%
because you have to pay extra
to go outside the system

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:90%
to save your own life.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
you start down that road?

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, first of
all, I tell my patients,

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:90%
don't go to the doctor.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Number one, look at
a medical doctor.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Can anyone name
one chronic disease

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:84%
that medical doctors have
found a cure for in 100 years?

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
They haven't cured one disease
in 100 years, chronic disease.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, what makes you an expert
if you're a 100-year failure?

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:84%
They found one cause of a
chronic disease-- smoking

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:90%
causes cancer.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure they found it.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:90%
It was tossed upon them,

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they don't
even have a choice.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:84%
With the AMA regulations
what they are,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:84%
what choice does
the doctor have.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Now you're in the system.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
It's being covered by your
insurance through your work.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
They found something
because you went and you

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:84%
had your scans and whatnot,
or colonoscopy or whatever,

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:90%
and they've now found something.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And so what choice does your
doctor in that system have?

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: The
doctor has no choice.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:90%
They must go by the system.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I once got charges
brought against me

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that I cured a person
with an illegal means.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.834 align:middle line:84%
I had a severe case
of what's called

00:25:05.834 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
optic neuritis
that came in to me.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've done multiple
different types of therapies,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and there's a therapy
called neural therapy.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I actually injected
the nerve area

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and I fixed up the optic
neuritis in 24 hours.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that patient
was so excited,

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:84%
he wrote a note to
several doctors.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-oh.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, just
to tell 'em what went on.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
The doctors complained about
me and they brought charges

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:84%
against me that I cured
a person illegally.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.207 align:middle line:84%
And the head of the
board said, "We do not

00:25:34.207 --> 00:25:36.290 align:middle line:84%
care if your patients are
getting better or worse.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:84%
We only care if you're
doing the work in our way,

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.716 align:middle line:90%
scientifically."

00:25:40.716 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, die in our
hands, but don't you

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
dare get better in
a way we don't know.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything's got to be done
by the system, controlled

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:90%
by the system.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And they oversee it by
the insurance companies.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
The box you check
off, they oversee it.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It's as basic as that.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.651 align:middle line:84%
I once had a random
Medicare-- "random."

00:26:01.651 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:84%
One of three presented
physicians are picked our

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
every year for a
random Medicare audit.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
They randomly picked out 28
cases out of my 3,000 files.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Those 28 cases only
involved something

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:90%
called chelation therapy.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Something that I've
personally never done,

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.613 align:middle line:90%
because I've not been into that.

00:26:17.613 --> 00:26:19.162 align:middle line:84%
But I know other
people have done it.

00:26:19.162 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And I had a guy
that worked with me

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:84%
in my office of three
months that did it.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Those were his 28 cases.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The random audit picked out
the only 28 cases of them

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:90%
out of 3,000 files.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not random.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.045 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No.

00:26:31.045 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:90%
They chose it as an illegal spy.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
had already started

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:90%
making waves by this point.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, that's
why they went after me.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:84%
The reason they picked it
out on me is I was a rebel.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You called me a renegade,
which I liked that.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Arizona,
the medical board

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:90%
was coming after me.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But there were people,
some laypeople,

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.291 align:middle line:84%
trying to get a homeopathic
establishment licensing going.

00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And I went up to the governor,
Governor Babbitt at the time,

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:90%
and I said, these are laypeople.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we make the law
a medical law that you

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:84%
have to be an MD or an
osteopathic physician

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go on to
this alternative law?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
tried to incorporate

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.005 align:middle line:84%
these "alternative"
therapies that

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:84%
had been around far longer than
allopathic medicine into law.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they say no good
deed goes unpunished.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:10%
And so that is how you
ended up outside the system.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:10%
There was, essentially,
a bit of a witch hunt.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.822 align:middle line:10%
And you were audited.

00:27:26.822 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:10%
Didn't have any
patient complaints.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.239 align:middle line:10%
But they found a way
to shut you down.

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So you had to go south
of the border, where

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.321 align:middle line:90%
you could practice all of this.

00:27:33.321 --> 00:27:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just doing that in a
nutshell so you don't have to.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So that allowed you to be
free of these constrictions

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
of the AMA, however, and really
start doing some amazing case

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.829 align:middle line:90%
studies in healing.

00:27:48.829 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It was the
back door to heaven.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a
blessing in disguise.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: There
I was, basically

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.867 align:middle line:10%
I had to leave the United States
because the United States,

00:27:57.867 --> 00:27:58.700 align:middle line:10%
they didn't want me.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:10%
The states didn't
want me anymore

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.159 align:middle line:10%
because I was such a rebel.

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:90%
And I go to Mexico.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And Baja is a free trade
zone, which is fascinating.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
You can order anything
from around the world.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a total free trade zone.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Then what I had-- and it's
strange to say-- but truly,

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I had a guinea pig population.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that's failed
in the United States

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.160 align:middle line:90%
came down to Mexico.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they still do.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes,
and they still do.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you had a population
of people that were lost,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Given up by the system.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I then had supplies from
any place in the world.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.869 align:middle line:84%
So I can now start to
try different things

00:28:32.869 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:90%
with all of these people.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it was like
a human guinea pig system,

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
because you couldn't
harm them any more.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.040 align:middle line:90%
They're already dying.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
already ravaged.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of them had
been through whatever

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.120 align:middle line:90%
the available therapies of--

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They've
been through everything.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --allopathic
medicine were.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.526 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: No one goes
to Mexico for medicine

00:28:49.526 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:90%
unless it's a last resort.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.930 align:middle line:90%
So the last resort.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But then I had a population
that I can try things with.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was
fascinating over there.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.646 align:middle line:84%
We started to-- it took
awhile, but step by step,

00:29:02.646 --> 00:29:03.520 align:middle line:90%
the more I got to it.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And the blood would tell me.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:84%
You can see in a cancer
patient, the blood will die.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Take a drop of blood, it'll
die within a half hour,

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:84%
an hour, right in
front of your eyes.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.080 align:middle line:84%
You can meet a five-year-old
kid that's healthy,

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:84%
his blood will live on a slide
three or four, five days.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And the faster the blood
dies, the faster you die.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:90%
It's as basic as that.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So I had this population
that everyone gave up on.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And the buck stops with me.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So I can start to
figure out things.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of learning that
went on in those seven years

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that I was in Mexico was
absolutely incredible.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.527 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you able to
help a lot of those people?

00:29:40.527 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh, yes.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.060 align:middle line:10%
The more I got into it, the
more we can help people.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:10%
We definitely had what I
call a cure rate with cancer.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:10%
Something that American
medicine doesn't--

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can't
say that in America.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
You can't say
anything about a cure.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.564 align:middle line:84%
Except, as you say, at
the end of a sentence.

00:29:58.564 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Searching for a cure.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:01.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A cure.

00:30:01.785 --> 00:30:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Since they've
never cured anything,

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.881 align:middle line:90%
you can't say that.

00:30:04.881 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:90%
But we had a cure rate.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And I went into
medicine to help people.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And medicine-- I was so suicidal
in medicine after a few years,

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:84%
because patients
never got better.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Now I had a whole
area, and I could

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.694 align:middle line:84%
work to figure out how to get
people better and stronger.

00:30:21.694 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I started to put together
different philosophies

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.805 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:30:24.805 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:84%
It was so exciting,
to work so free.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to see people
actually recover themselves.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.177 align:middle line:90%
People who had been given up on.

00:30:35.177 --> 00:30:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Totally.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:84%
From cancer cases
to autistic cases

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.760 align:middle line:84%
to all different types of
cases everyone has given up on.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you
have to figure out

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:51.680 align:middle line:84%
why is this body, this great
machine, not working correctly?

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
ways to look at it.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I would look at it, what's
wrong with this machine?

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.815 align:middle line:84%
And why do you only work on
four cylinders or five cylinders

00:30:59.815 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:90%
over there?

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:90%
And step by step.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.310 align:middle line:90%
It was a process.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
that I had is

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:90%
that I did a lot of blood work.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And the teachers that
taught me that passed away.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:90%
So the buck stopped with me.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there weren't many
people doing this at the time.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
were you learning?

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Incrementally, what were you
learning, then, from the blood

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and applying as you became
aware of the other therapies

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:90%
available around the world?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: First of all,
I started seeing things

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:84%
in the blood that
there's no name for.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:84%
There are several
things, when you

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.790 align:middle line:84%
look at the blood,
absolutely no name for.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:84%
The things that are
swimming around.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And these huge
crystals in the blood.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Only one red cell goes
through a capillary at a time.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.435 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
my book, we have

00:31:42.435 --> 00:31:43.680 align:middle line:90%
pictures of these crystals.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:90%
These crystals are huge.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.750 align:middle line:90%
How did they get there?

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And they tell you pictures.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I have pictures, one of
which one of my books has,

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.990 align:middle line:90%
of a perfect broken leg.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And you match it up with
a Grey's Anatomy textbook,

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and you see a perfect,
perfect broken leg.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And that picture
was taken two weeks

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.300 align:middle line:84%
before the patient
broke her leg.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
the femur bone, right?

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I remember you talking
about this story once.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:90%
That is so fascinating.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, this
hologram in the blood

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:21.870 align:middle line:84%
was something that her being
was anticipating on some level.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Was conjuring,
anticipating, was going

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to be moving into
this experience.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was showing
itself holographically

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:90%
crystallized in the blood.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's just
an amazing story.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: The story
was, she was 80 years old,

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.043 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted her kids
to take care of her,

00:32:36.043 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:90%
and they weren't interested.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was talking to
her on the phone.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.161 align:middle line:84%
Well, the only way
they'll take care of her

00:32:41.161 --> 00:32:42.720 align:middle line:90%
is if something happens to her.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:90%
So she was thinking about that.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was very,
very interesting.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.390 align:middle line:84%
She sent me a slide
right then and there,

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and there was that perfect
picture of that broken leg.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And two days later,
what happens,

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.935 align:middle line:90%
I get a call from her son.

00:32:55.935 --> 00:32:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Guess what happened
to my mother?

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.434 align:middle line:84%
She walked out of the house
and slipped on the ice.

00:32:59.434 --> 00:33:01.170 align:middle line:84%
But she ended up
breaking her arm.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And the difference is,
an 80-year-old person who

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
breaks their leg, they're
never getting out of bed,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.306 align:middle line:84%
and they're really
going downhill.

00:33:06.306 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So subconsciously, she morphed
it into breaking her arm,

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:90%
and then got what she wanted.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
she wanted emotionally, was

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:90%
the support from her family.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And she needed to have a
broken wing, so to speak.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: That's right.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:90%
So they can help her.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.690 align:middle line:84%
That was the only way
they would take her in

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about a few other cases

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
like that that
you've seen, where

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.083 align:middle line:84%
you were seeing a crystallized
pattern in the blood that

00:33:26.083 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:84%
was a direct
representation of what

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.904 align:middle line:90%
was wrong with that person.

00:33:29.904 --> 00:33:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, we
have pictures in my book.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of the pictures that
I have in this book over here.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Holographic Blood."

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: "The
Holographic Blood."

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a picture,
and this is a picture

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:90%
of a torn organ, a torn spleen.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And this was a person that
was in a skiing accident,

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:90%
tore her spleen.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, Interesting.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.026 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: And there
it is, the spleen,

00:33:46.026 --> 00:33:47.830 align:middle line:90%
blood leaking right out of it.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:51.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the most interesting
cases I like-- I deal with,

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:90%
my cases are so tough.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.559 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes I
have a lot of fun.

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:56.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
was having a lot of fun

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:90%
with is I had a pregnant woman.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And there were pictures
of the baby in the blood.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.800 align:middle line:10%
That was so awesome,
to see the pictures

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:10%
of the baby in the blood.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:08.790 align:middle line:10%
And my book will show it.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:11.659 align:middle line:10%
I have a picture of
a-- in the blood,

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.139 align:middle line:10%
a picture of a six-week fetus.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:10%
We did a sonogram
on the same day,

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:10%
and it's almost the exact same
picture as in the sonogram.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.495 align:middle line:84%
Then we did the blood
again at three months.

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It had progressed the
same, the crystalline structure

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:84%
in the blood, the holographic
crystalline structure.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.026 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:32.639 align:middle line:84%
It progressed all the
way, until at six months,

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:90%
you actually saw a picture.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:38.514 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, there was
a penis and it was a boy.

00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:84%
And right in the blood,
you can see the whole thing

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.741 align:middle line:90%
in the blood.

00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:90%
My books have pictures of it.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
And those pictures, they
were taken years ago,

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.560 align:middle line:90%
and they still give me chills.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this
takes-- this takes us

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:84%
deeper into a much larger
matrix of some kind.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to be talking about
some kind of participation

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and imprint from what we
can loosely call the spirit,

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.920 align:middle line:84%
or what others
will call the soul.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Something is imprinting
itself on our blood.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.632 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is--
I don't know if it's

00:35:08.632 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:84%
anything you've looked
into a great deal,

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.016 align:middle line:84%
but historically, how
was the blood perceived?

00:35:15.016 --> 00:35:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I'm not
sure what you mean.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the time of
Hippocrates and others,

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:90%
how was the blood perceived?

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.445 align:middle line:90%
Even in Egyptian times?

00:35:22.445 --> 00:35:23.327 align:middle line:90%
This was sacred.

00:35:23.327 --> 00:35:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: It was sacred.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.500 align:middle line:84%
The blood has been sacred in
religions and stuff like that.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jewish.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:90%
It's totally sacred.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do things
with the blood.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:36.744 align:middle line:84%
The blood, going back, all
the way back, the spirit

00:35:36.744 --> 00:35:37.410 align:middle line:90%
is in the blood.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.820 align:middle line:90%
The life is in the blood.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in the blood.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:90%
It'll tell you the story of it.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And religions have had that.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Societies have had
that philosophy,

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that the blood is a whole--
the soul is in the blood.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're saying,
what you just said,

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.340 align:middle line:90%
the soul is in the blood.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.820 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing images of what
your soul is creating for you.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:90%
You see it in there.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And the patient may not even
know. it, that subconsciously,

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:90%
their thoughts are in there.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And the blood will tell
you every little thing

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.409 align:middle line:90%
that's going through you.

00:36:12.409 --> 00:36:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, Edgar Cayce, going back to,
since you mentioned him before.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.686 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce said the
same thing, essentially.

00:36:19.686 --> 00:36:21.393 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: "The
phycisian of the future,

00:36:21.393 --> 00:36:23.180 align:middle line:84%
from one drop of
blood, will diagnose

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.850 align:middle line:84%
the condition of the
entire physical body."

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.727 align:middle line:84%
That was his prediction
in the mid-1930s..

00:36:28.727 --> 00:36:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here we are today.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: And we
are doing it today.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The technology
really-- well, the technology

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.330 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Rife had developed his
superscope by then.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:90%
It was there.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.860 align:middle line:90%
They were able to see it.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Remember the famous picture?

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:42.180 align:middle line:90%
The end of cancer.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: The
technology is there.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't need
anything really fancy.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.500 align:middle line:84%
What Muschlein is
doing with the Ergonom,

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.775 align:middle line:84%
and Rife had his
special technology.

00:36:49.775 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself a
decent microscope,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's so obvious,
it's just right there.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't even need--
you need what's

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.710 align:middle line:90%
called a dark field condenser.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.500 align:middle line:90%
But that'll show you.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.665 align:middle line:84%
And you can have a
cheap microscope.

00:37:01.665 --> 00:37:03.950 align:middle line:90%
It's so obvious in there.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:08.150 align:middle line:10%
What amazes me is that
no American laboratories

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.302 align:middle line:10%
or doctors have looked
at the live blood.

00:37:10.302 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:11.510 align:middle line:10%
They don't.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: Totally amazes me.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.651 align:middle line:10%
I once had the Chief of
Hematology of Boston Medical

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:10%
School.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Now Boston, the academic
mecca of the universe.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.170 align:middle line:90%
He was the Chief of Hematology.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.110 align:middle line:84%
He was outside my
door, and he wouldn't

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.568 align:middle line:84%
come in and look
at the live blood.

00:37:24.568 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:84%
He said, why would anyone
look at the live blood?

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:28.290 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So fortunately, there are some
people doing it very seriously.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Another man I
interviewed, he was

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.480 align:middle line:90%
a student of yours, Dan Dunphy.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, he was.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.613 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he does a
really deep, beautiful job

00:37:39.613 --> 00:37:43.136 align:middle line:84%
of looking at it from all
levels, just like you do.

00:37:43.136 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And the emotions
which impact, as you

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:84%
say, our acid-alkaline
balance start

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
showing up immediately
in the blood,

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.056 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you go
off emotionally.

00:37:52.056 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: As soon as the
thought hits your mind--

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your blood changes.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN:
Instantaneous change.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you go to acid.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.316 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:37:58.316 --> 00:38:02.100 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, as you get
stressed, the cells become acid

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and they dump alkaline waste.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.652 align:middle line:84%
So the blood pH
starts to go higher.

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And caner, that's what
goes on in cancer.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.870 align:middle line:84%
When we are in a meditative
state, the bloods are alkaline,

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:16.370 align:middle line:84%
it dumps acid waste,
and the pHs come

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:84%
down to where they should be,
and that keeps us in health.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.305 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
total validation

00:38:20.305 --> 00:38:22.910 align:middle line:84%
for having some kind of
quieting practice, right?

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:25.534 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a nice little
walk in the woods or something.

00:38:25.534 --> 00:38:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I've actually
taken people's blood

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.169 align:middle line:84%
before, then had
them go into the room

00:38:29.169 --> 00:38:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and meditate, and
take it afterwards,

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see
differences in the way

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:90%
that blood has calmed down.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:90%
That fast.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, something
else I remember

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.101 align:middle line:84%
is that you say are
blood platelets.

00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
blood moving, you're

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.520 align:middle line:84%
looking at dirty, sticky blood
that's barely even moving.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything's stuck together.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you do some
of the type of remedies

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.160 align:middle line:84%
you do, or people
go in and find a way

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to calm themselves or whatnot,
and shake that blood loose

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.777 align:middle line:84%
so the cells are
operating independently,

00:38:59.777 --> 00:39:00.860 align:middle line:90%
and they're flowing again.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.980 align:middle line:84%
We have lovely images
of all of that.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
activity of platelets

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and what they are, because
this was shocking to me.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.995 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, platelets,
first of all are a plant.

00:39:10.995 --> 00:39:12.120 align:middle line:90%
There's no animal DNA.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what's shocking.

00:39:13.495 --> 00:39:16.060 align:middle line:84%
There's no animal
DNA in our platelets.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.954 align:middle line:84%
We have our own
garden within us.

00:39:18.954 --> 00:39:21.120 align:middle line:84%
We have our own garden that
we need to take care of.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no animal DNA in it.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:84%
When I learned that one,
that totally excited me,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:90%
put me onto a new level again.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now, what
are the implications of that

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.740 align:middle line:90%
when you're looking at blood?

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.656 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, one
of the things I look at,

00:39:32.656 --> 00:39:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I can tell the chronicity,
how chronic the disease is,

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:38.390 align:middle line:84%
by just looking
at the platelets.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.180 align:middle line:84%
As we get acutely
ill, the platelets

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.567 align:middle line:90%
become larger and more numerous.

00:39:41.567 --> 00:39:43.150 align:middle line:84%
As we get chronically
ill, they become

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.560 align:middle line:90%
smaller and less and less there.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Just by observing
the size of them.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.440 align:middle line:90%
I go right into the blood.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.850 align:middle line:84%
When I look at the blood
under the microscope,

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I find a central
portion of blood,

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I find some
platelets right away.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And just by this size of them,
I can tell how ill you are.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And looking at nothing
else, I can tell.

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:02.690 align:middle line:10%
Then there are aspects
in the platelets--

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:10%
let's assume you had
a gallbladder problem.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.850 align:middle line:10%
There'll actually
be giant platelets.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:10.889 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden
giant ones, and it

00:40:10.889 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:10%
can almost sometimes be in
the shape of the gallbladder

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.050 align:middle line:10%
and everything, saying
that the body is really

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:18.020 align:middle line:10%
working on that aspect.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:10%
The more giant the platelet is,
the more acute the problem is.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.285 align:middle line:10%
The smaller the platelet, the
more chronic the problem is.

00:40:24.285 --> 00:40:26.320 align:middle line:10%
It tells you how long
you've had the disease.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I use
different remedies

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to match the platelets to
start to get you better

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.915 align:middle line:90%
and get you stronger.

00:40:33.915 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Put them
into a normal range.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.193 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Put them
back into normal range.

00:40:37.193 --> 00:40:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How is it
possible that our platelets

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:90%
are plant-based?

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: That
still amazes me.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think that's the
great aspect of the creation.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I just wonder we have
living things in us.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I just sometimes
wonder that, if you

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.300 align:middle line:84%
went with great
microscopes, you'd

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.775 align:middle line:84%
see whole worlds in
those living things.

00:40:56.775 --> 00:40:59.860 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things--
we don't know anything.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.860 align:middle line:84%
One of my problems is
there's so few people that

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.400 align:middle line:84%
do what I do that I don't have
anyone to talk to about this.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.713 align:middle line:90%
And you know Bruce Lipton.

00:41:07.713 --> 00:41:10.120 align:middle line:90%
You probably know him.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he says.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:90%
You are a community of cells.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And the degree of
your health has

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to do with how well your cells
communicate, get along with one

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:21.120 align:middle line:90%
another.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:84%
You, as the captain of the
ship, what kind of input

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.750 align:middle line:84%
an information, whether
they're calm or agitated.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:32.251 align:middle line:84%
That you're the captain of this
community of billions of cells.

00:41:32.251 --> 00:41:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: It's all one unit.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:84%
If I step on your foot, your
shoulder knows you're in pain.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we need to
get to Lyme disease.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:90%
This is a really big one.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.370 align:middle line:84%
You've been working
on this a long time.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theory
that you likely

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.402 align:middle line:84%
have not heard before
unless you've heard Harvey,

00:41:48.402 --> 00:41:50.693 align:middle line:84%
because it's approaching it
from a completely different

00:41:50.693 --> 00:41:51.540 align:middle line:90%
position.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Lyme disease
to me-- number one,

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:58.810 align:middle line:84%
it's a tremendous epidemic
that's growing massively.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It's blamed on the
bite of a tick.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:84%
At least 70% of
my patients never

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.412 align:middle line:84%
even saw a tick that
had Lyme disease.

00:42:05.412 --> 00:42:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have quite a few,

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:08.657 align:middle line:90%
because they know of this now.

00:42:08.657 --> 00:42:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I'll have a
book out by the springtime

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:90%
on Lyme disease.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I love treating Lyme
disease because it

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.050 align:middle line:84%
tells the truth of
what's going on.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It really explains the
concept of the germ changing

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a germ
if you really know it.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:84%
What I have found
in Lyme disease,

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:31.220 align:middle line:84%
80% of Lyme disease patients
have had some type of surgery

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.730 align:middle line:84%
within a year of the
diagnosis of Lyme disease.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is surgery?

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Surgery is actually a
legal attack with a knife.

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.430 align:middle line:84%
If I cut your gallbladder
out behind 7/11,

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.470 align:middle line:90%
you knew you had a problem.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But you think because the doctor
did it you're fine and healthy

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
live happily ever after.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.340 align:middle line:90%
The body was stabbed.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:90%
The cells were not asleep.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.180 align:middle line:90%
They have felt that stab wound.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:58.940 align:middle line:90%
That has changed.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And the scars that that
stab wound has pulled in

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:05.110 align:middle line:84%
has pulled in different parts of
the body, so things can't flow.

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:07.720 align:middle line:84%
They've now created
an obstructive wall.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.341 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned earlier we have
five diaphragms in the body.

00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:84%
We have a diaphragm in
our pelvis, which is just

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.755 align:middle line:84%
constantly moving, about
8 to 10 times a minute.

00:43:14.755 --> 00:43:17.280 align:middle line:84%
We have the diaphragm
that we know of.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Our Adam's apple works
like a diaphragm.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have two
diaphragms in the brain,

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.870 align:middle line:84%
called the super and
inferi tentorium.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.905 align:middle line:84%
The whole body's expanding
and contracting and pumping.

00:43:26.905 --> 00:43:30.450 align:middle line:84%
If everything is doing evenly,
you're in perfect health

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.090 align:middle line:90%
and as good as the Messiah.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, no one's
really in perfect health.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Always we have little stresses.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're upset and
worried about something,

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:40.550 align:middle line:90%
you may tighten up.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:42.680 align:middle line:84%
That will start to affect
the diaphragm, just

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.850 align:middle line:90%
by your own stresses.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So the stresses
will tighten us up.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say in meditative
state, we're much more relaxed.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:55.200 align:middle line:84%
As we relax ourselves,
now the blood circulation,

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.650 align:middle line:84%
everything can go
through those areas.

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So disease cannot exist where
there are no obstructions.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
cause of obstructions

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:84%
are your own
emotions and surgery.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
have a scar now?

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.344 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
is exactly happening

00:44:10.344 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:84%
in the scar that would
make the link between that

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:90%
and the Lyme disease then?

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.973 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, the
scar, what it's doing,

00:44:15.973 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:84%
it's blocking the body from
functioning completely.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I liken the body to
an eight-cylinder car

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:90%
built by God.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Every Lyme disease case is
working on four cylinders.

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've thrown a
couple cylinders away.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.130 align:middle line:84%
They've done something to it so
all the other cylinders are not

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.740 align:middle line:84%
getting enough of
the circulation too,

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.860 align:middle line:90%
so they're not working as well.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Lyme disease, most people
are working on four or five

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.771 align:middle line:90%
cylinders.

00:44:36.771 --> 00:44:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I've got to figure out, why are
they working on four or five

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.510 align:middle line:90%
cylinders?

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:44.700 align:middle line:84%
The germ is just growing
in the weakened patient.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.930 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.277 align:middle line:84%
They blame it on the germ, going
back to Pasteur, going back

00:44:49.277 --> 00:44:51.110 align:middle line:84%
to the pharmaceutical
industry and Rockwell,

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.371 align:middle line:84%
they blame it on the
germ and the tick.

00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're saying
most of the people that

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.860 align:middle line:84%
have Lyme disease have
never been out in the woods

00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:59.600 align:middle line:84%
nor encountered a tick
to their knowledge.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.433 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Correct.

00:45:00.433 --> 00:45:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:02.780 align:middle line:90%
They were told.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what goes
on with doctors now,

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:06.830 align:middle line:90%
autoimmune diseases.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:09.340 align:middle line:84%
That means you're
allergic to yourself.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Basically, if the doctor
can't figure it out,

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:13.900 align:middle line:84%
something must have done it
to you that we don't know,

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.233 align:middle line:90%
something invisible invaded you.

00:45:15.233 --> 00:45:16.552 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, this is big.

00:45:16.552 --> 00:45:17.510 align:middle line:90%
A lot, a lot of people.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched people go
through the various therapies

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.460 align:middle line:84%
for Lyme disease and
watched them practically

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.410 align:middle line:84%
die as a result of the
therapies themselves.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So now you're saying
80% of these people

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.000 align:middle line:90%
have had surgery within a year.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And now you're saying
this is an epidemic.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But what's also interesting
is, alongside the rise in Lyme

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.890 align:middle line:84%
disease is a rise in
elective surgeries.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: That's the epidemic.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.360 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The more people that are cut
with a knife, the more Lyme

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.000 align:middle line:90%
disease we're going to have.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And we do have an
epidemic of surgeons.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.200 align:middle line:84%
We do have an epidemic of
surgery without question.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.409 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the tick
that's causing it.

00:45:55.409 --> 00:45:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You say you have
two diaphragms in your head.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fastest growing
area of surgery right now,

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.780 align:middle line:84%
emerging new surgeons,
is plastic surgery,

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.260 align:middle line:90%
cosmetic surgery.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.067 align:middle line:84%
And if you have two
diaphragms in your head, what

00:46:08.067 --> 00:46:09.150 align:middle line:90%
does that mean for people?

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:10.476 align:middle line:90%
Have you had to deal with this?

00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Probably,
they have a fair chance

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.016 align:middle line:84%
of ending up with
Alzheimer's, actually.

00:46:14.016 --> 00:46:15.505 align:middle line:84%
The whole skull--
there's 22 bone

00:46:15.505 --> 00:46:16.838 align:middle line:90%
in a skull that are interlocked.

00:46:16.838 --> 00:46:17.690 align:middle line:90%
They're not fused.

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:19.290 align:middle line:90%
There's hinges in there.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And the tailbone actually
moves 8 to 10 times a minute

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and pumps the cerebral spinal
fluid up into the skull.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And as the fluid gets up in
there to nourish the brain,

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:28.957 align:middle line:90%
the skull expands.

00:46:28.957 --> 00:46:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Pressure becomes too
great and it contracts.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:32.248 align:middle line:84%
We've got a whole
hydraulic pumping

00:46:32.248 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:84%
system that's
nourishing the brain.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you take it and
do a plastic surgery,

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.020 align:middle line:84%
you're taking the
skin, tying down,

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and you're locking that down.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So you're locking
the pumps down.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting
this stuff through.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.183 align:middle line:84%
Now the whole head is
locked into a position.

00:46:49.183 --> 00:46:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Not enough fluid
getting through.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.000 align:middle line:84%
That brain will
start to deteriorate.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Seriously,
there is this link?

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: There
is totally a link.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.530 align:middle line:90%
I look into the histories.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Even my secretary can
look at the history

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:03.536 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, that
started the disease.

00:47:03.536 --> 00:47:04.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It's very obvious.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The patient comes
in, Lyme disease.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.150 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Right in the history.

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: There's
no link on it.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:17.485 align:middle line:84%
They blame everything that they
don't know on something else.

00:47:17.485 --> 00:47:20.674 align:middle line:90%
They don't know anything.

00:47:20.674 --> 00:47:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.965 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah, because
they're not looking

00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:24.760 align:middle line:10%
in the same places
you're looking.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.070 align:middle line:10%
So now once you've
determined that a person has

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.730 align:middle line:10%
these blockages due
to surgeries and such,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:10%
what can be done about it?

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.331 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, what I do
is try to get the body back

00:47:33.331 --> 00:47:35.130 align:middle line:10%
into its best working shape.

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:10%
There's ways to treat the
scars, to loosen them up.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.890 align:middle line:10%
And that's called neural
therapy or scar therapy.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:44.570 align:middle line:10%
A lot of it comes from
Europe, and I do that a lot.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.229 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, you want
a really good physician?

00:47:48.229 --> 00:47:50.520 align:middle line:84%
They've got drool coming out
of their mouth and a knife

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.353 align:middle line:90%
in their other hand.

00:47:51.353 --> 00:47:55.310 align:middle line:84%
They can't wait to do something
to you, do a procedure to you,

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.050 align:middle line:90%
to help you do something.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And I know one fellow I used
to go to was in Arizona.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And he used
different modalities.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.680 align:middle line:90%
He was a chiropractor doctor.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But one thing he used also was
vibrations of a SCENAR device,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.570 align:middle line:84%
using frequencies over
scars to start loosening up.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:15.830 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, first
of all, the chiropractor

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:17.710 align:middle line:90%
can't inject it.

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I can use things to inject
the scar to loosen it up.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.496 align:middle line:84%
But the chiropractor
can't get it.

00:48:21.496 --> 00:48:22.995 align:middle line:84%
But he's a very
bright chiropractor.

00:48:22.995 --> 00:48:25.182 align:middle line:84%
He knows that scar is what's
called an interference

00:48:25.182 --> 00:48:26.390 align:middle line:90%
field or a disturbance field.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And he always works
on that on people,

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.010 align:middle line:84%
their scars with
the SCENAR device.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Which is skalar wave
technology, isn't it?

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, it is.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:34.863 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:34.863 --> 00:48:35.512 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: And
anything you can do

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:38.800 align:middle line:84%
to loosen up that scar
is very important.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll give people an exercise try
to stretch out multiple ways.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.895 align:middle line:84%
But classic neural
therapy, scar therapy.

00:48:44.895 --> 00:48:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is the
little mini-injections?

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They're
mini-injections using procaine.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Which actually, procaine is
different than xylocaine,

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.380 align:middle line:90%
lidocaine, novocaine.

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Procaine breaks down
into two B vitamins.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.670 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
negative about it.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I use that to start
to soften the scar up.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.789 align:middle line:84%
Now, once I start to
soften the scar up--

00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I said there's five
diaphragms in the body.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.280 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to pump.

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I can work on the body
physically to stretch it open

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.680 align:middle line:84%
and get those diaphragms
pumping again.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So a Lyme patient
comes in, they're

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.610 align:middle line:90%
working on four cylinders.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:18.385 align:middle line:84%
They leave working on six
cylinders or seven cylinders.

00:49:18.385 --> 00:49:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And all the sudden,
they're feeling different

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.900 align:middle line:84%
because we've broken the
blocks, eliminated that.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Organs are getting
the circulation.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And quote, their "Lyme
disease" gets cured.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:28.650 align:middle line:90%
It's so much fun.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:29.961 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is fun.

00:49:29.961 --> 00:49:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And not just Lyme disease;
many, many, many things.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: All
disease is related

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.370 align:middle line:84%
to what's going on
with the physical body.

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You look at the physical
body as just a magical thing.

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.914 align:middle line:90%
Get your darn hands off of it.

00:49:42.914 --> 00:49:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
isopathic therapies.

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:46.479 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: OK.

00:49:46.479 --> 00:49:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's
something that is not commonly

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:51.050 align:middle line:90%
used here in the United States.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And most people have never
heard the word before.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you can
explain what it is.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a large
part of what you do.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, since we're
a bunch of germs,

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:03.610 align:middle line:84%
isopathic remedies are
actually live germs.

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Live bacteria, live fungus.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.532 align:middle line:84%
One of the germs
we use is actually

00:50:08.532 --> 00:50:09.615 align:middle line:90%
a live form of penicillin.

00:50:09.615 --> 00:50:12.376 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:14.500 align:middle line:84%
If you have a pneumonia,
it'll get rid of pneumonia

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.860 align:middle line:90%
within a few hours.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.065 align:middle line:84%
And there are no
allergies to it.

00:50:18.065 --> 00:50:19.690 align:middle line:84%
You may be allergic
to the penicillin--

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I will say this.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I came to you one time.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you only live
about 45 minutes from me,

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:25.830 align:middle line:90%
which I'm lucky.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And I came to you
one time and had

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.680 align:middle line:84%
some kind of very strange
thing a couple of years ago.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.540 align:middle line:90%
I'd never had anything like it.

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And you gave me some of the
natural isopathic antibiotics.

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that thing
was gone in six hours.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: They work so fast.

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.621 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it was deep.

00:50:46.621 --> 00:50:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: They work so fast.

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I can make your red cells so
smooth and so elastic it'll

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.110 align:middle line:84%
get through the
tiniest capillary.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:55.595 align:middle line:84%
I've broken strokes on the
spot by opening up the--

00:50:55.595 --> 00:50:59.134 align:middle line:84%
by getting these-- by using
these isopathic remedies.

00:50:59.134 --> 00:51:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is
it about the germs?

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Is there a certain
intelligence going on?

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the germs can
do these instantaneous healings

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:07.717 align:middle line:90%
almost at times?

00:51:07.717 --> 00:51:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Not all the time, but sometimes.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.341 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, there is
an intelligence-- everything

00:51:11.341 --> 00:51:14.300 align:middle line:84%
has an intelligence-- but it's
the waste product of the germ.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.031 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:51:15.031 --> 00:51:16.280 align:middle line:90%
The waste product of the germ.

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.321 align:middle line:84%
The waste product of
penicillin is what you want.

00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:21.690 align:middle line:84%
The waste product of
that germ is the key.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:24.470 align:middle line:84%
The waste product of
the germ aspergillus

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:28.890 align:middle line:84%
is a very important key to the
body eliminating its wastes.

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:30.440 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
detox a person, you

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.590 align:middle line:84%
use the aspergillus germ,
which is called Nigersan

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.542 align:middle line:90%
by the isopathic company.

00:51:35.542 --> 00:51:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's the waste
product of that.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And it opens up all the
organs of elimination

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:41.120 align:middle line:90%
and detoxification.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.527 align:middle line:84%
So when I want to clean a
person up, I give them that--

00:51:43.527 --> 00:51:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That germ.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.594 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: That germ.

00:51:45.594 --> 00:51:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
creepy at first to people.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, I'm eating germs.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:50.514 align:middle line:90%
But it's in a capsule form.

00:51:50.514 --> 00:51:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Or it's in the
little injectables.

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal really.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not gross or anything.

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: The concept
that the creator

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.750 align:middle line:84%
made these tiny, invisible
little things to beat you up

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.880 align:middle line:90%
is a ridiculous concept.

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about why-- Now, these

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.977 align:middle line:90%
are mostly produced in Germany?

00:52:06.977 --> 00:52:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Mostly
produced in Germany, yes.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And why is this
something that hasn't really

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:14.320 align:middle line:84%
caught on if it's
that effective?

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Even in the United States,
there are people out there

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.010 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to
make a difference.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:21.637 align:middle line:90%
Why has that not caught on?

00:52:21.637 --> 00:52:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Several-- it's
political, a lot of it.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it's brainwashing
by the system,

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.420 align:middle line:90%
by the pharmaceutical system.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Look at most commercials
on prime time TV

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.980 align:middle line:90%
are pharmaceutical commercials

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.897 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:52:31.897 --> 00:52:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: It's a brainwashing.

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also because
you went through what you went

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.830 align:middle line:84%
through, and it freed
you up from the system,

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:42.000 align:middle line:84%
you can bring these things
in where an M.D. can't.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.375 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I'm
out of the system

00:52:43.375 --> 00:52:46.229 align:middle line:84%
now, because the system will
only deal a certain way.

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're not allowed to
step out of the system.

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
out of the system,

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.780 align:middle line:84%
so you can bring the isopathic
remedies and some other things

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in as well that most people
don't have access to.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.382 align:middle line:84%
But why can't a naturopath
bring in these things?

00:52:56.382 --> 00:52:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: They can do that.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:58.892 align:middle line:90%
The problem is to learn these.

00:52:58.892 --> 00:53:00.850 align:middle line:84%
You can't learn them easy
in the United States.

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:03.526 align:middle line:84%
There's no place to really
teach them in the United States.

00:53:03.526 --> 00:53:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where do people go
if they want to learn about it?

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:08.060 align:middle line:84%
What if someone's
watching right now that

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.620 align:middle line:90%
wants to extend their practice?

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: We're going to be
teaching that more and more.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I learned it by apprenticeship
by German physicians.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.400 align:middle line:84%
German naturopathic
physicians taught me.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn this
by apprenticeship.

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.225 align:middle line:90%
This is not--

00:53:23.225 --> 00:53:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
not an online course.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.955 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: You can't
do it on the weekends.

00:53:27.955 --> 00:53:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Lyme disease, you're not
going to fix in a weekend.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.420 align:middle line:84%
It took the person
a while to get it.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Cancer took a while to get it.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to slowly-- you're

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.549 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
change that around.

00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:38.480 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
you a while to fix it.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But we can change
using the remedies.

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I can reverse a year of
disease in one month.

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So I can reverse the process,
if you really understand.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.440 align:middle line:84%
What I do with the germs is I
don't go after your disease.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.640 align:middle line:90%
I make you stronger.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're going
to clean up the blood

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.197 align:middle line:84%
and make the blood
flow proper again.

00:53:56.197 --> 00:53:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: And make your body--

00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Strong, healthy cells.

00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: --as
strong as possible.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Bring you up to six
cylinders, seven cylinders.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And you're perking along.

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:06.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what I do,
and I do it by--

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again,
it's not a magic bullet.

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:10.860 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to come in--
sometimes people do come in

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and some amazing
things have happened,

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.340 align:middle line:90%
like that time with me.

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It does happen
quickly sometimes.

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.210 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times, a person
has to invest in themselves

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of taking time to allow
these things to take effect.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And do you see a breakdown
in that, where people just

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.702 align:middle line:90%
don't want to take the time?

00:54:26.702 --> 00:54:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Right
at the beginning,

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I give them that it's a process.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Like I was starting to say
before, one month of treatment

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.900 align:middle line:84%
will reverse a
year of a process.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.165 align:middle line:84%
So if 10 years ago,
something happened to you,

00:54:38.165 --> 00:54:40.310 align:middle line:90%
you had surgery.

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.290 align:middle line:90%
And you've never been the same.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Now you're working only
at 80% efficiency instead

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.796 align:middle line:84%
of 100% efficiency,
it'll take me 10 months

00:54:47.796 --> 00:54:48.920 align:middle line:90%
to completely reverse that.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.770 align:middle line:84%
But you'll start noticing it
right away, the difference now.

00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:54.850 align:middle line:84%
But it takes about
a month of therapy

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to reverse a year
of the process.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'll do that by
releasing the scars,

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:04.070 align:middle line:84%
getting the body back into the
position it's supposed to be.

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing nothing
fancy or different.

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to get this
car that's created by God,

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.590 align:middle line:84%
unbend its fenders,
straighten its wheels out.

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:15.694 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:55:15.694 --> 00:55:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the car is going
to get you better mileage.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:18.735 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:18.735 --> 00:55:20.150 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
minute or so left.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
else you'd like

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.633 align:middle line:84%
to add to the conversation
we haven't already discussed?

00:55:23.633 --> 00:55:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you're at a
point in your career where

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.420 align:middle line:84%
you're reaching out to
other practitioners to say,

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.910 align:middle line:90%
let's share information.

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:33.540 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know more
about dark field microscopy,

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.910 align:middle line:84%
you're happy to help and
become a mentor to others.

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:37.690 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:38.737 align:middle line:90%
So just a few seconds.

00:55:38.737 --> 00:55:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: What we need to
have is a network of people.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:42.110 align:middle line:90%
I really want a network.

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:45.085 align:middle line:84%
I'll be setting up a teaching
program with microscopes.

00:55:45.085 --> 00:55:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So I want people
with microscopes

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.400 align:middle line:84%
all around the country
and all around the world.

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So someone in Germany
has got a microscope,

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.790 align:middle line:84%
is looking at
hepatitis C blood, I

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.046 align:middle line:84%
want to know what
they're seeing.

00:55:56.046 --> 00:55:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
looking to connect.

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.128 align:middle line:84%
So if there's anyone
out there that

00:55:59.128 --> 00:56:01.880 align:middle line:84%
knows how to set up
this kind of network,

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Harvey's looking
for you right now.

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And we talk to each other.

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:06.504 align:middle line:90%
No more competition.

00:56:06.504 --> 00:56:07.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a cooperation thing.

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:09.086 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: This
is a cooperation.

00:56:09.086 --> 00:56:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And if I knew all the
answers, I'd be the Messiah.

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out
what other people see

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.520 align:middle line:90%
and what they're thinking.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're thinking in the same
direction of why this is not

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:21.350 align:middle line:90%
running a perfect situation.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't ever
stop looking, Harvey.

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.725 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:56:24.725 --> 00:56:26.058 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: You're very welcome.

00:56:26.058 --> 00:56:27.262 align:middle line:90%
It's always fun, Regina.

00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm guessing you now
know more than almost anyone

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.780 align:middle line:90%
else in your world about blood.

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.500 align:middle line:84%
You can learn more
about blood by reading

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Harvey's book,
"Holographic Blood," which

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:37.040 align:middle line:90%
is available on Amazon.com.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.680 align:middle line:10%
You can also contact
Harvey through his website,

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.700 align:middle line:10%
at DrBigelsen.com-- and
that's B-I-G-E-L-S-E-N--

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:10%
to find out where a qualified
practitioner who truly

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:49.040 align:middle line:10%
understands this
terrain work might be.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:56:52.060 --> 00:57:15.867 align:middle line:10%
