Last summer, we had Suzy Miller
here in the Gaiam Studios

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:40.107 align:middle line:84%
with us to talk about her
experience of autistic children.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
As a pediatric speech
and language pathologist,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.712 align:middle line:84%
she had felt ineffective
with standard means

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.715 align:middle line:84%
of bringing these sensitive
individuals out of themselves.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.517 align:middle line:84%
Through an intuitive
breakthrough, however,

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:51.685 align:middle line:90%
she eventually learned

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.521 align:middle line:84%
that autism was much
more spiritually driven

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
than what anyone
could've possibly guessed.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.526 align:middle line:84%
Suzy ultimately paired up
with Dr. William Tiller,

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:03.363 align:middle line:84%
a former Stanford professor and
pioneer in intention research.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:06.066 align:middle line:84%
They are conducting a
groundbreaking experiment

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.703 align:middle line:84%
in remote healing of autism;
truly phenomenal work.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.071 align:middle line:90%
We've talked off camera.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.807 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some of the graphs
and charts of what is happening

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:17.277 align:middle line:84%
with these kids and
if I were a parent

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:21.714 align:middle line:84%
or loved an autistic child, I'd
want to know what you're doing.

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I would want to be part
of it and I can't wait

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.319 align:middle line:84%
until the day comes when
everybody can be part of it.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.521 align:middle line:90%
So let's lunge into it.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:30.589 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Suzy, give
us a little bit of a recap

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.225 align:middle line:84%
of what happened to
you and how you came

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:90%
into connection with these kids.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.829 align:middle line:84%
We talked about it a
little bit in our last show,

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.330 align:middle line:90%
but let's go there again.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.632 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:42.335 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, I was a pediatric
speech language pathologist

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:46.172 align:middle line:84%
and I was working with --
had a private practice,

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:51.144 align:middle line:84%
a new child came to my case load
and was diagnosed of autism;

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:54.014 align:middle line:84%
hadn't have much success
with autism prior to that.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:57.317 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
when I met him,

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.587 align:middle line:84%
he was literally walking back
and forth in the daycare center

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.657 align:middle line:84%
where he worked --
where he was being seen

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:05.425 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "It's
the millennium.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.894 align:middle line:90%
It's 1999."

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And from my speech
pathology eyes I thought,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.898 align:middle line:84%
"You're a freaky
little kid," you know.

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:12.999 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Suzy Miller: It's just
so strange[background talking].

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.067 align:middle line:90%
You don't know that word.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.335 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Yeah
[laughter], millennium.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:16.503 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.772 align:middle line:84%
But, what was interesting
is he came up to me

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:22.843 align:middle line:84%
and made direct eye contact
with me and he said, "Master."

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:27.681 align:middle line:84%
And when he said "Master,"
I had a visceral experience.

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:31.117 align:middle line:84%
Everything on me -- in
me was on high alert.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:34.287 align:middle line:84%
And it took me kind
of a few minutes

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.523 align:middle line:84%
to get my bearings
quite frankly,

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.693 align:middle line:84%
but right after that I
took him into a backroom

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.762 align:middle line:84%
in the daycare center in order
to work with him privately.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.699 align:middle line:84%
And when I shut the door,
you know, I kind of sat

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.534 align:middle line:84%
down against the
back of the door.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:48.969 align:middle line:90%
He was new to me.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.003 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to work with me.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.272 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to be with
his friends.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.641 align:middle line:84%
And as I was letting him
just walk around the room,

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:59.646 align:middle line:84%
what I saw was floating above
his physical body kind of --

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.282 align:middle line:84%
physical body here,
light body here.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.551 align:middle line:90%
There was a body of light

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:07.921 align:middle line:84%
that was floating right
above into his right.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I never seen anything
like that in my life

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.693 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know what
it was at that time.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.429 align:middle line:84%
But as I asked myself, you
know, the logical question,

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.764 align:middle line:90%
"What the heck is that?"

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:21.434 align:middle line:84%
What I heard with --
through what I know now

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:24.537 align:middle line:84%
as telepathy was,
"That's my light body.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
You're here to help me
integrate my light body

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.042 align:middle line:90%
into my physical body."

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:34.047 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea what that was
or why he thought I could do

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.116 align:middle line:84%
that or any of those
kinds of things,

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:41.321 align:middle line:84%
but we spent the next year
working where he would come

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:44.057 align:middle line:84%
and he would either through
dreams, or through meditation,

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.159 align:middle line:90%
or through telepathy, would come

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.361 align:middle line:84%
and tell me exactly what
I needed to do in order

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.196 align:middle line:90%
to support his integration.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.064 align:middle line:90%
And it was effective?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.465 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: It was effective.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. It was wonderfully
effective.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.437 align:middle line:84%
He communicated -- began
communicating and writing

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:00.006 align:middle line:84%
and being able to let
people know what he needed

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.075 align:middle line:90%
and how he wanted things to be.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.444 align:middle line:84%
So it was quite a
change actually.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:06.513 align:middle line:84%
Now, that happened
with him specifically,

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:09.049 align:middle line:84%
but when did you start tapping
into some of the other kids?

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.385 align:middle line:84%
How did that process come about
on the same telepathic level?

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: It came about
pretty much simultaneously

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.925 align:middle line:84%
with Riley [assumed spelling]
-- my experience with Riley.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.295 align:middle line:84%
What happened is as soon as
I met Riley I was also open

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:26.566 align:middle line:84%
to my guides, or whatever
you would like to call them;

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:30.804 align:middle line:84%
but on top of that, the more
I worked with other children

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.773 align:middle line:84%
on my caseload that now we're
also diagnosed with autism

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:36.042 align:middle line:84%
because all of a sudden they
started coming like crazy.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.511 align:middle line:90%
It was really interesting

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.748 align:middle line:84%
because the collective
had a voice as well,

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:45.552 align:middle line:84%
and so sometimes I would
hear the higher consciousness

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:48.388 align:middle line:84%
of the children, an
individual child speaking,

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:53.226 align:middle line:84%
but when I had questions about
something, then I was tapping

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.862 align:middle line:84%
into this collective
consciousness.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.364 align:middle line:90%
And over the years,

00:04:57.364 --> 00:05:00.433 align:middle line:84%
I've developed quite
a dialogue with them.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:01.401 align:middle line:90%
So now it's more...

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.169 align:middle line:84%
And this is more
of a mass language;

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.006 align:middle line:84%
it's a collective consciousness
that has a single voice

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:07.841 align:middle line:90%
of sorts, telepathically?

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.042 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Absolutely.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.344 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Suzy Miller: And
they're providing a lot

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.147 align:middle line:84%
of the bigger picture
kinds of things

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.683 align:middle line:84%
versus because I don't
work so much individually

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:20.954 align:middle line:84%
with parents and
children anymore.

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:23.656 align:middle line:90%
That was helpful at that time

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:27.027 align:middle line:84%
but now it's bigger picture
things so that I can work

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:29.629 align:middle line:84%
on things like the autism
intention experiment

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.765 align:middle line:84%
And you clearly started
integrating this

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.767 align:middle line:84%
into your practice and
you have other people

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:35.668 align:middle line:84%
that are practitioners
under you, right?

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.206 align:middle line:84%
We have 60 -- close to 60
certified practitioners

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle line:90%
in 11 different countries now.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.677 align:middle line:84%
So they're learning the
same kinds of skill sets

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:48.815 align:middle line:84%
so that they can telepathically
communicate with these children

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:53.586 align:middle line:84%
where they can also begin to
not just get the information

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
but deliver that information
to a parent who may

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.061 align:middle line:84%
or may not be well versed in
the multidimensional reality

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.896 align:middle line:90%
of their children, or...

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:03.997 align:middle line:90%
Right. Suzy Miller: ...you know.

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:06.066 align:middle line:84%
So it's one thing to
get that information,

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.902 align:middle line:84%
it's quite another thing to
be able to deliver it in a way

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:12.505 align:middle line:84%
that people can really
understand and begin

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:14.908 align:middle line:84%
to explore themselves
because of it.

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:19.379 align:middle line:84%
But now, let's talk about these
continually expanding messages

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.315 align:middle line:84%
from these kids, which I
find absolutely fascinating

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.851 align:middle line:84%
because I hear a
lot of truth in it.

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:28.421 align:middle line:84%
And one of the subjects is
they talk about who they are,

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.891 align:middle line:84%
why have they come and they
talk about the new human.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.961 align:middle line:84%
So take a little bit of
time and paint a portrait

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:38.531 align:middle line:84%
of what it is they're saying,
they are and we will become.

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:40.333 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Right.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.435 align:middle line:90%
You know, I think, number one,

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:45.605 align:middle line:84%
they always say "We
are the new technology.

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:48.541 align:middle line:84%
We're the tech -- we are the
-- we're the new science.

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.943 align:middle line:90%
We're the new education.

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:51.811 align:middle line:90%
We're the new medicine."

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.981 align:middle line:84%
They also say that that
technology is the technology

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.382 align:middle line:90%
of love.

00:06:56.382 --> 00:07:00.954 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
to me because I believe

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:04.157 align:middle line:84%
that this population is
coming at a time in history

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:08.294 align:middle line:84%
where we need a higher state of
consciousness to be among us,

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.997 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to be
present with us.

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:14.968 align:middle line:84%
And they don't do -- they
aren't having such a fun time,

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:18.571 align:middle line:84%
if you will, in the physical
body, but energetically,

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:22.642 align:middle line:84%
dimensionally, vibrationally,
they are very well versed.

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And so as they come now,
they're really helping to tip --

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.952 align:middle line:84%
to tip the vibrational
frequency of humanity.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I see them almost as the
new Epoch, the children

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
of the new Epoch, as they
begin to kind of guide us

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.029 align:middle line:90%
into a new trajectory.

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And a trajectory where we
don't see ourselves simply

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.439 align:middle line:84%
as physical bodies or mental
minds, but that we really begin

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:58.811 align:middle line:84%
to understand ourselves as
a spirit, as source beings.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:03.816 align:middle line:84%
They're holding a lot of the
collective consciousness,

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
holds a tremendous
amount of information.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.521 align:middle line:90%
As a matter of fact, it's part

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:11.691 align:middle line:84%
of the reason why I started
this certification process

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:14.561 align:middle line:84%
because the information
that's available

00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:16.996 align:middle line:84%
within that consciousness
about the new science,

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:23.436 align:middle line:84%
the new technology, it's so vast
that, you know, no small group

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:25.838 align:middle line:84%
of people could begin
to access that and think

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.274 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to figure that all out.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:33.947 align:middle line:84%
But the more people that we
can have access to this level

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:36.683 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, the
more they're tapping

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.618 align:middle line:84%
into certain aspects of it
that they resonate with,

00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:41.421 align:middle line:90%
that they're true for them.

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:45.858 align:middle line:84%
So it's really expanding
in enormous ways.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. They're -- I think that
on a very practical level, too,

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.633 align:middle line:84%
you see what these
children are changing,

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.735 align:middle line:84%
the physical children
are changing simply

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:90%
because they're here.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.372 align:middle line:84%
They are changing
medicine right now.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.008 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't look at
-- we don't look at medicine.

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:04.611 align:middle line:84%
We don't look at vaccines
and things like that anyway

00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:08.581 align:middle line:84%
that we did when they --
before they showed up in mass.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.616 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, you look

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.451 align:middle line:84%
at what's happening
within education.

00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:16.723 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you have one in,
you know, 44, one in 54 kids,

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.726 align:middle line:84%
whatever the current statistic
is, and those are showing

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:23.429 align:middle line:84%
up in educational settings,
education changes simply

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.965 align:middle line:84%
because the demand for
that change is there.

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.669 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller: And it's --
we're also seeing it showing

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:33.039 align:middle line:84%
up in the technologies
as well, so...

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.441 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you were talking
about the technology of love.

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.777 align:middle line:84%
They say this is the
technology of love and lest

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that anybody feel that that
is some kind of woo-woo

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:84%
or religious kind of
notion, that's not.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.987 align:middle line:84%
And your partner in this,
Dr. William Tiller, says --

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:50.923 align:middle line:84%
he calls it "love is
the universal solvent."

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.593 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
about creating

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.862 align:middle line:90%
within that particular frequency

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:58.931 align:middle line:84%
which everyone who's experienced
even a glimpse of the feeling,

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:02.335 align:middle line:84%
the total feeling of
unconditional love, knows you're

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:06.739 align:middle line:84%
in a much higher state of
reality, what we can create

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:08.608 align:middle line:90%
as a species across the board

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.643 align:middle line:84%
from there is a completely
different reality.

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:12.879 align:middle line:84%
So it's not woo-woo
to talk about...

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:13.913 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: No.

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.048 align:middle line:84%
...the technology of
love by any means.

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:16.649 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: No, and the
kids have been saying

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:90%
for a long time now,

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.086 align:middle line:84%
the collective consciousness
has been saying

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:23.056 align:middle line:84%
that this population
cannot fully be here

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:26.559 align:middle line:84%
until the frequency up here
is the frequency of love.

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:29.228 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller: And they're
not talking, obviously about,

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:90%
you know, the Valentine's Day...

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.633 align:middle line:84%
No. Suzy Miller: ....or
whatever we perceive as love.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.602 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
that recognition.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.504 align:middle line:90%
I see you and you see me.

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:43.743 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about the
saturation of a certain level

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:48.047 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness which
allows us to all be who we...

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:50.516 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller:
...really are meant to be.

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:53.853 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, these kids have
also told you that they --

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:84%
they are living in what they
define more of the seventh,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.125 align:middle line:84%
eighth and ninth
dimensional fields.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.728 align:middle line:84%
That's where they
actually exist and that's

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:05.865 align:middle line:84%
where their information is
streaming through from, which,

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:08.701 align:middle line:84%
looking at -- I interviewed
Barbara Hand Clow recently,

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:11.704 align:middle line:84%
looking at the nine dimensions
of our being and our interface

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:15.541 align:middle line:84%
with life and reality, and
that makes perfect sense.

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:19.011 align:middle line:84%
So coming from there,
however, into a physical body,

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:23.282 align:middle line:84%
what an incredibly
torturous and painful thing

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.351 align:middle line:90%
that they must be going through.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.987 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have never
incarnated physically or not

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
since the days of
ancient lost civilizations

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.525 align:middle line:90%
with much higher frequencies.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.359 align:middle line:90%
What do they tell you?

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.228 align:middle line:90%
How do they explain this to you?

00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:37.063 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. What they explained is

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:41.834 align:middle line:84%
that their integration process
is they function primarily

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:45.404 align:middle line:84%
in a dimensional realms, if you
will, at the level of the soul,

00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:48.574 align:middle line:84%
like you say, seventh, eighth,
ninth dimensional realms.

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:51.644 align:middle line:84%
But in order to integrate
into the physical body,

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:55.248 align:middle line:84%
they are coming in --
they have to integrate

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:56.749 align:middle line:90%
into the emotional body.

00:11:56.749 --> 00:12:01.521 align:middle line:84%
The emotional body is
the first collective body

00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:04.857 align:middle line:84%
that they can really have
some kind of access to and

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:08.261 align:middle line:84%
yet it's also the body that
is probably the most disturbed

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:09.695 align:middle line:90%
within the human consciousness.

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:12.698 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller:
So, anybody who goes

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:15.301 align:middle line:84%
through any integration
process, your --

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:18.905 align:middle line:84%
our ability to integrate into a
physical body is going to meet

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:90%
with some kind of trauma, right?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.676 align:middle line:84%
Just simply because from
nonphysical to physical,

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:27.013 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be some degree
of trauma related to that;

00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:30.516 align:middle line:84%
and that all resides
within the collective,

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:32.852 align:middle line:84%
in that collective
emotional body.

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:35.621 align:middle line:84%
So here, these children are
trying to interface with that,

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
trying to integrate
into that space,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.761 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing they hit
is this distorted collective

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.262 align:middle line:90%
emotional body.

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:47.233 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of the reasons why
they say some simple things

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:50.636 align:middle line:84%
like we don't care that you
-- we don't care how you feel.

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:52.305 align:middle line:84%
We care that you
know how you feel.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:55.541 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a -- it's a
very simple statement,

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:59.612 align:middle line:84%
and yet it's hugely impactful,
because in order for you

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:02.615 align:middle line:84%
to know how you feel,
you have to be in touch

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.783 align:middle line:90%
with your emotional body.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.619 align:middle line:84%
You have to be present
to it and so --

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.589 align:middle line:84%
and you also have to be
outside of judgment of it.

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:12.325 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller: So,
how often does the --

00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
does your own emotional
stuff come up,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.363 align:middle line:84%
anybody's emotional stuff come
up and we automatically move

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:84%
into judgment of
self because we think

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.936 align:middle line:84%
that is an individualized
independent

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:26.772 align:middle line:84%
"I did something wrong" and
I pushed it way out there

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.107 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it wasn't
going to come back

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.376 align:middle line:90%
but here it comes again.

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:33.813 align:middle line:84%
What they're really helping
us understand right now

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.281 align:middle line:90%
or helping me understand is

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:38.885 align:middle line:84%
that that emotional body
has to be dealt with.

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:42.355 align:middle line:84%
It has to be integrated
and one of the things

00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:45.791 align:middle line:84%
that they're also showing me
is their vibrational frequency

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:49.962 align:middle line:84%
as they begin to integrate into
the collective emotional body.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.964 align:middle line:90%
They're dropping a little bit

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:56.602 align:middle line:84%
of their higher dimensional
energy into that space.

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:59.906 align:middle line:84%
So they're clearing
it on the one hand,

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:02.942 align:middle line:84%
at the same time they're
trying to integrate into it.

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:06.879 align:middle line:84%
And on a really practical level,
this shows up day in and day

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:10.316 align:middle line:84%
out in all of their households,
because if you talked

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:13.452 align:middle line:84%
to any parent of a child
diagnosed with autism,

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:16.289 align:middle line:84%
they will tell you that those
kids pushed their buttons

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:17.823 align:middle line:90%
like you would not believe.

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:20.059 align:middle line:84%
Their emotional bodies
completely

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:25.197 align:middle line:84%
and constantly being triggered,
but not in a malicious way,

00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
not in a negative way;
it's being triggered

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.706 align:middle line:84%
because these parents are also
very much helping the collective

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.776 align:middle line:90%
consciousness rise, right?

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:39.779 align:middle line:84%
So as they begin to have
awareness about themselves,

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:84%
as they begin to be present
to their emotional bodies,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.421 align:middle line:84%
number one, their very children
can come in a little bit closer

00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:51.724 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit further,
but when their children are

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.327 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit closer
and a little bit further,

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:59.231 align:middle line:84%
it has a positive effect on the
whole emotional body, therefore,

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:02.468 align:middle line:84%
the emotional body of the
earth, again, the emotional body

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:90%
of all sentient beings

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.271 align:middle line:84%
in relationship[background
talking] to [inaudible].

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.039 align:middle line:84%
Right, and that's a
good point you bring up;

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.775 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that the
global coherence project is

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:13.479 align:middle line:84%
working with as well,
is this emotional --

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:17.583 align:middle line:84%
the emotional fabric of the
emotional body of the planet.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.151 align:middle line:90%
We tend to think of we

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:22.822 align:middle line:84%
as multidimensional beings
can acknowledge our emotions,

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
our emotional body,
but the same is true

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.125 align:middle line:90%
with the earth itself, right?

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.159 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yep.

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.494 align:middle line:84%
And so these kids
are dealing not only

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:33.432 align:middle line:84%
with the human emotional body
but the interface of that

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.634 align:middle line:84%
with the earth itself
that they're coming into,

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
so I can understand why
to them it would feel

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.205 align:middle line:90%
so incredibly dense.

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.374 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Well, and
not only that, I mean,

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:43.576 align:middle line:90%
these children are also very --

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:46.779 align:middle line:84%
they're very connected to the
earth's movement, you know.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.382 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller: So you
watch this population,

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:52.118 align:middle line:84%
classrooms across the
world where you have a lot

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
of children diagnosed
with autism.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
You watch them a week
before something happens,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.628 align:middle line:84%
something erupts within the
earth, and you'll watch them,

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:06.499 align:middle line:84%
they'll feel it, the
tension, the anxiety, the --

00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:10.202 align:middle line:84%
all of that beings to happen
because they are one with...

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:14.106 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller: ...that
collective earth emotional body;

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:17.676 align:middle line:84%
and the minute it releases,
that's a whole another ballgame

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:20.112 align:middle line:84%
because they'll always
also say, you know,

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:22.481 align:middle line:84%
we feel the stress
leading up to it.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:23.816 align:middle line:90%
When you guys are all stressed

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.718 align:middle line:84%
because it's happened,
we're fine.

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:29.021 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're doing the
other piece of the puzzle.

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:31.223 align:middle line:84%
And just like the animal
kingdom which is operating

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:32.992 align:middle line:84%
in a much finer subtle
instincts.

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:33.759 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Very similar.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.895 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Very similar.

00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:40.433 align:middle line:84%
Okay. What about the whole
notion of vaccines and toxins

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:43.769 align:middle line:84%
and dumping these things into
the bodies of little kids.

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:46.405 align:middle line:90%
What are they saying the effects

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:49.975 align:middle line:84%
of these horrid toxins
are on them?

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:51.177 align:middle line:90%
And on kids at large?

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.478 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:56.282 align:middle line:84%
This population is coming
in much more sensitive

00:16:56.282 --> 00:17:00.519 align:middle line:84%
than previous populations, so --
and I think that what they're --

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:04.222 align:middle line:84%
what they've been sharing
is that there are all kinds

00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:07.893 align:middle line:90%
of toxins here that are not --

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:13.265 align:middle line:84%
not a great match for who they
are vibrationally, and vaccines,

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:17.068 align:middle line:84%
they have definitely said it's
-- falls into that category.

00:17:17.068 --> 00:17:20.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're taking a
brand new baby in many cases

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.977 align:middle line:84%
and you are giving
them these vaccines.

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It's putting in a substance
that is dense as far

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.118 align:middle line:84%
as they're concerned
and has to be processed

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:36.088 align:middle line:84%
in the body somehow, has to be
transmuted in the body somehow.

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.923 align:middle line:90%
That's not always easy to do

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:41.026 align:middle line:84%
when these children
haven't even integrated

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.394 align:middle line:90%
into the physical body yet.

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:46.198 align:middle line:84%
They're taking -- they're
not integrating at, you know,

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:49.635 align:middle line:84%
two or three months of
age, you know, after birth.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:55.374 align:middle line:84%
They're -- they are integrating
more like age three, age five.

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:58.611 align:middle line:84%
So -- and this is when all of
these vaccines are taking place;

00:17:58.611 --> 00:18:00.146 align:middle line:84%
they're taking place
between birth

00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:02.615 align:middle line:84%
and three-year birth
and school age now.

00:18:02.615 --> 00:18:05.017 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller:
And so it is --

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:11.157 align:middle line:84%
it's an issue, but there
are also other issues as far

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
as the level of toxicity
that are not a match

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.896 align:middle line:84%
for what they consider
the new humans.

00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:20.799 align:middle line:84%
And I think by them being
here also, we are --

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:23.636 align:middle line:84%
we have a much greater
understanding of that.

00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:27.072 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to parents
now, it's not a given

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.175 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to just
vaccinate their kids just

00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:30.242 align:middle line:90%
because somebody said so.

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:31.777 align:middle line:84%
No. And it's really
a subject of autism

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:32.945 align:middle line:90%
that has forced that discussion.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.146 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: It has
forced the discussion.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Which will eventually,
hopefully affect parents

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.884 align:middle line:90%
of all children...

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:39.985 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:41.787 align:middle line:84%
...I mean, because it
is now center stage,

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.656 align:middle line:84%
that conversation
is center stage.

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:45.057 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:50.095 align:middle line:84%
We did -- I was on a panel with
some physicians and a while back

00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:53.799 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking
about vaccinations

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:57.436 align:middle line:84%
and it just thrilled me because
there were probably, you know,

00:18:57.436 --> 00:19:01.073 align:middle line:84%
a hundred or so mothers in this
little bitty room all crammed

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:03.742 align:middle line:84%
in with their little babies,
but they were all listening

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:05.678 align:middle line:90%
to the same conversation.

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:07.413 align:middle line:90%
And this whole conversation

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:09.181 align:middle line:84%
about what the collective
consciousness

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:13.152 align:middle line:84%
of the children diagnosed of
autism have been talking about.

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:17.389 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of at the more
subtle realm, you know,

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:19.592 align:middle line:84%
so they're picking it
up first in many ways

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:23.295 align:middle line:84%
but they're absolutely passing
that information on saying,

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:25.698 align:middle line:84%
"You know, this is the way we
are all going to be moving.

00:19:25.698 --> 00:19:31.003 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to become more
and more energetically aware

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:36.041 align:middle line:84%
and our sensitivities -- our
energetic sensitivities prior

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:37.943 align:middle line:84%
to that will help
with that awareness.

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:39.879 align:middle line:84%
I consider them to
be very brave souls.

00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:42.681 align:middle line:84%
This has to be quite
uncomfortable an experience

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.017 align:middle line:84%
for them in this crossover
phase while we are...

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:45.951 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Learning.

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:47.019 align:middle line:90%
...becoming [laughter].

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:47.953 align:middle line:84%
While we're learning,
setting the field,

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:50.723 align:middle line:84%
becoming the new
humans as it were.

00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:52.057 align:middle line:90%
And I had the experience

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:54.526 align:middle line:84%
of interviewing a
man named Ron Davis.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.328 align:middle line:84%
I think I mentioned this
in our last interview.

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.764 align:middle line:84%
I bring it up again
because he was one

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:02.935 align:middle line:84%
who is now probably 70 years
old, but told us what it was

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:90%
like being locked in there.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.672 align:middle line:90%
He didn't speak until he was 17.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:07.873 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.008 align:middle line:90%
What a forerunner.

00:20:09.008 --> 00:20:13.445 align:middle line:84%
He was a forerunner and
he was explaining how --

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:15.581 align:middle line:90%
and that he was aware of living

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:17.683 align:middle line:84%
in three dimensions
at any given time.

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So he could see him -- the
various aspects of himself

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.022 align:middle line:84%
and was aware of what
he was doing in each

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:24.757 align:middle line:84%
of these dimensions
at any given time.

00:20:24.757 --> 00:20:28.427 align:middle line:84%
But then he spoke to the subject
of these little ones that seemed

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:30.562 align:middle line:84%
to be disengaged with
their environment,

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:33.399 align:middle line:84%
unmotivated to crawl,
unmotivated to walk,

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:36.769 align:middle line:84%
and he said, well, the reason
for that was in his experience,

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:39.972 align:middle line:84%
in his own little body,
he said, "You already --

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:43.676 align:middle line:84%
you're beyond time and space,
so you can send your curiosity

00:20:43.676 --> 00:20:46.545 align:middle line:84%
around the corner to look at
something or experience it.

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It experiences and
then it comes back.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.282 align:middle line:84%
You don't ever have to crawl
over [laughter], touch it,

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:52.051 align:middle line:84%
put it in your mouth,
or whatnot.

00:20:52.051 --> 00:20:53.452 align:middle line:90%
You've already experienced it.

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:56.989 align:middle line:84%
So they look just like little
lumps and unmotivated," he said.

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Quite the contrary.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.091 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Right.

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.126 align:middle line:84%
They've had the experience
in their back already.

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:02.461 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yes, exactly.

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:04.163 align:middle line:84%
And the only difference
is, you know,

00:21:04.163 --> 00:21:07.099 align:middle line:84%
when that verbal
component is not there,

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:10.302 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the opportunity
to say, "Hey, you don't need

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:90%
to go there, you know."

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller: Have
already had that experience and

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.941 align:middle line:90%
yet I'm hearing the same thing

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.077 align:middle line:84%
from the collective
consciousness

00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:22.614 align:middle line:84%
of the children some of their
skill sets are really beyond

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.717 align:middle line:90%
what we could imagine.

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:26.685 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a little
film coming

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:90%
in because the way it looks.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.888 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking
about all this.

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:32.524 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
beauty of these souls

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:35.094 align:middle line:84%
and the higher dimensional
information

00:21:35.094 --> 00:21:36.462 align:middle line:90%
and energy they're bringing in.

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:40.265 align:middle line:84%
However, we're going to show
a little film of what it looks

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:44.002 align:middle line:84%
like when someone's
having a bad day.

00:21:44.002 --> 00:21:53.078 align:middle line:90%
[ Film clip ]

00:22:18.604 --> 00:22:21.707 align:middle line:84%
On one level it looks
like any little kid,

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:24.777 align:middle line:84%
but on another there are certain
kind of hallmark patterns going

00:22:24.777 --> 00:22:27.146 align:middle line:84%
on there; and what
would you say looking

00:22:27.146 --> 00:22:29.548 align:middle line:84%
at that video would be
considered a pattern

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:30.549 align:middle line:90%
that you would look for?

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:32.317 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Well,
a couple of things

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:33.819 align:middle line:90%
that are happening right there.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:36.488 align:middle line:84%
The repetitive movement,
the physical movement back

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:41.226 align:middle line:84%
and forth; also, the repetitive
communication where they sound

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:43.495 align:middle line:84%
like they're kind of
speaking gibberish

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:47.466 align:middle line:84%
or they're not speaking
to anything or anyone,

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:49.535 align:middle line:90%
but it appears that way.

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:53.305 align:middle line:84%
But dimensionally, again,
if we take that same image

00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:56.175 align:middle line:84%
and we understand that
this child is functioning

00:22:56.175 --> 00:23:00.813 align:middle line:84%
in higher dimensional realms
while physically being present

00:23:00.813 --> 00:23:01.780 align:middle line:90%
in that body.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.915 align:middle line:84%
Who knows who they're
talking to?

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:04.917 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Who knows
who they're talking to?

00:23:04.917 --> 00:23:07.152 align:middle line:84%
And more often than not,
the collective consciousness

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:10.489 align:middle line:84%
in individual children have
said, "You know, when you look

00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:13.125 align:middle line:84%
at me and I'm looking up
into the corner of the room

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm waiving my hands and
moving my arms and flapping

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.232 align:middle line:84%
and things stemming if
-- as they call like...

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:21.233 align:middle line:90%
A lot of flapping, yeah.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.367 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Yeah,
a lot of flapping.

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:90%
One, I'm moving energy.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.241 align:middle line:84%
One, I -- there's so much moving
through me that in that moment,

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:32.177 align:middle line:90%
I have to work myself out of it.

00:23:32.177 --> 00:23:35.247 align:middle line:84%
I have to transduce it
through the physical body,

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.016 align:middle line:84%
so it makes sense that
movement would help that.

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:42.721 align:middle line:84%
The verbal communication is
just that, the ability of them

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.958 align:middle line:84%
to communicate in other
dimensional realms.

00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:49.962 align:middle line:84%
And I've even watched
children who were trying

00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:53.332 align:middle line:84%
to learn something
"academic," you know --

00:23:53.332 --> 00:23:58.203 align:middle line:84%
preschooler or learning to
identify pictures of animals.

00:23:58.203 --> 00:23:59.938 align:middle line:90%
And at the same time noticing

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:03.408 align:middle line:84%
that there is a dimensional
energy available to them

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:07.112 align:middle line:84%
in that space as well,
and suggesting, "Well,

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:09.515 align:middle line:84%
why don't you go and
get some help there?"

00:24:09.515 --> 00:24:14.987 align:middle line:84%
And turn around, child jumps on
the bed, talks to the corner --

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:18.724 align:middle line:84%
seemingly, gets information
and awareness,

00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:24.229 align:middle line:84%
comes back down to the floor
and "cow, pig, dog, cat,"

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is able to provide
information, you know.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.202 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller: How did
that happen unless they're able

00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
to begin to bridge that
multidimensional realm,

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.975 align:middle line:84%
you know, and be able
to actually use some

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.577 align:middle line:84%
of that higher dimensional
information

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
to support their
cognitive processing

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.349 align:middle line:84%
which is really a unique
concept to think about.

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:47.486 align:middle line:84%
It is. The men we mentioned,
Ron Davis, in that interview is

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:51.523 align:middle line:84%
on our Gaiam archives,
by the way, but he was --

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:55.527 align:middle line:84%
by the time he finally spoke,
they recognize this guy

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:84%
as way beyond anything
we can understand.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.565 align:middle line:90%
He spoke at 17.

00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:02.501 align:middle line:84%
By 19, he was helping --
I think it was Rockwell,

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:05.737 align:middle line:84%
debug the Polaris
missile system.

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:06.572 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Oh wow [laughter].

00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And when people would ask him,

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.075 align:middle line:84%
"How do you know math
at these levels?"

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:12.177 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "I don't
know math, I am math."

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.545 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yes.

00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, that's
a whole different level

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.849 align:middle line:84%
of relating wherever
he's living and he went

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:20.252 align:middle line:90%
on to do extraordinary things

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:23.055 align:middle line:84%
and created the Davis Dyslexia
Institute because, of course,

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:25.057 align:middle line:84%
what comes along with it,
they're learning disabilities.

00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:26.425 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Right.

00:25:26.425 --> 00:25:29.628 align:middle line:84%
And he figured it out how to
anchor these kids in and model

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:32.531 align:middle line:84%
out of clay and such so that
these kids could learn to read.

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:36.168 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: It's interesting
about the whole concept about

00:25:36.168 --> 00:25:37.235 align:middle line:90%
"I am math," you know...

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:38.503 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Suzy Miller: ...being math.

00:25:38.503 --> 00:25:42.074 align:middle line:84%
I've also heard a lot
of the children speak

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:44.476 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that,
you know, simple things

00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:49.348 align:middle line:84%
like children diagnosed with
autism love to play in water.

00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:51.216 align:middle line:84%
You know, they love throwing
it all over the place.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:52.551 align:middle line:90%
They love being in it.

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.486 align:middle line:90%
They love -- they love it.

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:58.724 align:middle line:84%
And it makes perfect sense
when you hear from them

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:84%
that they are being
one with the water.

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.195 align:middle line:84%
They're not separate from
the element of water.

00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:07.432 align:middle line:84%
They're not separate from the
fluidity, and so, again, it's --

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:10.502 align:middle line:84%
you know, whether it's "I'm
one with mathematics or I'm one

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:13.572 align:middle line:84%
with an element,"
it's -- this is the --

00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:84%
these are some of the precursors
and the pointers of what we

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.546 align:middle line:84%
as new humans will
become as we move

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:23.782 align:middle line:84%
into those higher
dimensions, as well.

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:28.587 align:middle line:84%
Now academically speaking of,
you have a little boy that --

00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:31.556 align:middle line:84%
well, he's a young
man now, what, 14?

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:32.658 align:middle line:90%
15 years old now?

00:26:32.658 --> 00:26:34.159 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Actually,
he's not mine.

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.027 align:middle line:90%
He's somebody that I...

00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:36.428 align:middle line:90%
He's out there.

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Yeah, he's somebody
out there that's amazing to me.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.134 align:middle line:84%
We have some video of him,
Jacob Barnett, who you're coming

00:26:42.134 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:84%
into dialogue I think just about
now with and looking to work

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.105 align:middle line:90%
with in this experiment.

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.874 align:middle line:84%
Wow. I think he's
made the rounds.

00:26:48.874 --> 00:26:51.476 align:middle line:84%
He's been on a lot
of TV shows already

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:53.979 align:middle line:84%
because he's not
separated from math.

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:56.882 align:middle line:84%
He's not separated from
anything and really

00:26:56.882 --> 00:27:01.053 align:middle line:84%
by the time he was 14,
full-blown brilliant physicist.

00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:04.222 align:middle line:84%
Talking, in this clip, we're
going to show in a second

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:06.925 align:middle line:90%
about space time, time travel.

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:08.527 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yes.

00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:10.095 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:11.496 align:middle line:90%
[Film clip] Have a [inaudible]

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:16.601 align:middle line:84%
and I briefly explain what it
was, and now I'm probably going

00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:19.104 align:middle line:84%
to go into it with a
little more detail.

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:25.477 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So this is like, just
a more detailed picture

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:28.647 align:middle line:84%
on how you could go
through the space time like,

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:31.183 align:middle line:84%
you go into a black
hole's event horizon;

00:27:31.183 --> 00:27:37.122 align:middle line:84%
if you get lucky,
you can come out.

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Next. Let's see.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:44.363 align:middle line:84%
Now a wormhole is composed
of space time itself,

00:27:44.363 --> 00:27:47.833 align:middle line:84%
see like here you
view our space time.

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:50.368 align:middle line:90%
At least two black holes

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:52.738 align:middle line:84%
and if you want [inaudible]
probably add in a couple more,

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:55.407 align:middle line:90%
but that's kind of complicated.

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:57.242 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, so they got
these black holes

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:59.845 align:middle line:84%
and then there's also a
thing called a white hole

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:02.881 align:middle line:90%
which is also probably in there.

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.083 align:middle line:84%
That is like the exact
opposite of a black hole.

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:06.785 align:middle line:90%
Black hole sucks everything in,

00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:10.288 align:middle line:84%
white hole pushes everything
out, and it's that white hole

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that allows you to go
through, otherwise,

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.259 align:middle line:84%
you get the singularity
[inaudible].

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:16.561 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:20.632 align:middle line:84%
Next, for our wormhole
we will have --

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:23.935 align:middle line:84%
right, there are also
like multiple dimensions

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:28.807 align:middle line:84%
that the space time
can bend in like a tear

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.742 align:middle line:84%
and then it could
be there, here.

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:35.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to draw a graph.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.916 align:middle line:84%
Well [laughter], yeah, of
course, I knew that [laughter].

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.184 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: You and everybody?

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:40.552 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and everybody.

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:43.955 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, here's just -- he
used to walk in patterns, right?

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:46.258 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: He's -- that's
actually a different child,

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:49.327 align:middle line:84%
kind of different child that I
worked with and he used to walk

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:52.764 align:middle line:84%
in energetic patterns in the
grass in front of my house.

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:55.267 align:middle line:84%
And when I would ask him, you
know, "What are you doing?"

00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:57.602 align:middle line:84%
He would say, "I'm
creating the templates

00:28:57.602 --> 00:28:59.538 align:middle line:90%
for where we're going to go."

00:28:59.538 --> 00:29:04.075 align:middle line:84%
And he had some real awareness
about the fact that we are

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:06.878 align:middle line:84%
as a humanity going through
in a state of consciousness.

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.346 align:middle line:84%
Right. And you had
something you wanted

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:09.447 align:middle line:90%
to say about Jacob himself?

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:10.382 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:29:10.382 --> 00:29:11.917 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
clarify something

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:14.219 align:middle line:84%
because I have actually
been seeking --

00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:16.454 align:middle line:84%
or Jacob out, you know, as
far as connecting with him

00:29:16.454 --> 00:29:17.689 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:21.526 align:middle line:84%
And so I truly feel like
he would have a huge impact

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:23.995 align:middle line:84%
on the autism intention
program...

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:26.698 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller: ...because
here's a young man both

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:32.604 align:middle line:84%
who knows the component of
autism, but also knows physics.

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:36.308 align:middle line:84%
You know, and, again, he doesn't
just know it; he is physics.

00:29:36.308 --> 00:29:39.344 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm really
excited to hopefully get

00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:40.512 align:middle line:90%
to spend some more time with.

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:41.613 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I hope that works out...

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:42.747 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Yeah,
that connection.

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:44.583 align:middle line:84%
...for you because as
William, as Bill says --

00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:48.386 align:middle line:84%
Bill Tiller, to be able
to work in that area,

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:50.021 align:middle line:90%
you have to go beyond any kind

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:52.057 align:middle line:84%
of current quantum
mechanics model,

00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:55.026 align:middle line:84%
beyond the electromagnetic
physical universe

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:57.662 align:middle line:84%
into completely other
dimensional fields

00:29:57.662 --> 00:29:59.965 align:middle line:84%
of information which this
little guy understands how

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:01.333 align:middle line:84%
to get there, in
fact, it sounds like.

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:02.734 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:05.237 align:middle line:84%
He absolutely -- he's -- I think
I watched an interview with him

00:30:05.237 --> 00:30:09.808 align:middle line:84%
where he said to Morley Safer
on 60 Minutes that he's --

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:11.176 align:middle line:84%
they were talking
about, you know,

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:12.711 align:middle line:84%
"How do you know
this mathematics?";

00:30:12.711 --> 00:30:13.812 align:middle line:84%
and he said something
like, "Well,

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.714 align:middle line:84%
it comes from the
fifth dimension."

00:30:15.714 --> 00:30:17.816 align:middle line:84%
Well, that shuts just about
everybody up really fast

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:20.118 align:middle line:84%
because what does
that actually mean?

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:22.587 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller:
And yet the other thing

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that I'm very curious
about Jacob in particular,

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:31.196 align:middle line:84%
is because he has this mind,
this autistic mind, if you will,

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:35.166 align:middle line:84%
and he processes information
so uniquely, so differently

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.636 align:middle line:84%
than most of human
consciousness,

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:40.972 align:middle line:84%
and because he has this IQ
that's higher than Einstein's

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:43.241 align:middle line:90%
that like a 170 right now.

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:49.581 align:middle line:84%
You pair that with his awareness
of being physics, as physics,

00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:51.850 align:middle line:84%
you know, what exactly
is possible?

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.319 align:middle line:84%
And it takes me right back
to the children saying

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.488 align:middle line:90%
"We are the new technology."

00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:57.756 align:middle line:90%
We are the new science.

00:30:57.756 --> 00:30:59.357 align:middle line:90%
We are the new education.

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:01.826 align:middle line:84%
Jacob's a beautiful
example of that.

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.228 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:06.531 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about how you
and Bill Tiller came together

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:08.733 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
talking with him as well --

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:12.604 align:middle line:84%
as the other half of this story,
how you two came together,

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:15.040 align:middle line:84%
how you formulated the
experiment and just kind

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.511 align:middle line:84%
of get us going on experiment --
this first round of experiment.

00:31:19.511 --> 00:31:20.645 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Right.

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I met Bill probably a
little over a year ago,

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.849 align:middle line:84%
a year and a half ago,
and we were having --

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:27.552 align:middle line:84%
actually, we weren't having
much of a conversation.

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:30.789 align:middle line:84%
He was having a conversation
and sharing his wisdom,

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:34.225 align:middle line:84%
and wonderful information
that he shares.

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:38.029 align:middle line:84%
But in that, we started talking
about autism and it wasn't

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:41.232 align:middle line:84%
until later he came back to
me and he said, "You know,

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:44.302 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd like to do
something around autism."

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:47.339 align:middle line:84%
But when he said that,
it was like, "Okay.

00:31:47.339 --> 00:31:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, you know.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.975 align:middle line:90%
He's a scientist.

00:31:49.975 --> 00:31:53.044 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a multidimensional
communicator."

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how those two things
are going to go together."

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.149 align:middle line:84%
But one of the very first
things that he said to me was,

00:31:58.149 --> 00:32:01.853 align:middle line:84%
"I think that we can really
support the integration

00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:04.723 align:middle line:84%
of these children according
to their soul's purpose";

00:32:04.723 --> 00:32:08.259 align:middle line:84%
and when he said "according
to their soul's purpose,"

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:12.163 align:middle line:84%
a flag went off for me because
I've been hearing for years

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.899 align:middle line:84%
from the collective
consciousness of the children

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:18.303 align:middle line:84%
that at some point in history
there would be somebody

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:21.306 align:middle line:84%
who would come along,
who would, one;

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
be able to support integration
on a much bigger scale

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
than what we had been able to
accomplish so far, and that also

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.418 align:middle line:84%
that this individual would
be able to really extend it

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:36.921 align:middle line:84%
to the masses, to a
broader population.

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I -- you know, you
hear those kinds of things,

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.827 align:middle line:84%
I kind of filed it as wait
and see, but the minute

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:45.764 align:middle line:84%
that Bill said "according
to their soul's purpose,"

00:32:45.764 --> 00:32:47.098 align:middle line:90%
I thought, "You're the guy."

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:51.036 align:middle line:84%
And the more we started to
talk, here was a physicist

00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:54.873 align:middle line:84%
who was willing to hear from
the collective consciousness

00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:56.207 align:middle line:90%
of the children.

00:32:56.207 --> 00:33:00.111 align:middle line:84%
So he immediately asked
me what to go to them

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:04.416 align:middle line:84%
to ask what they would want as
far as an intention statement,

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:06.885 align:middle line:84%
and so that's exactly
what I did.

00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:10.555 align:middle line:84%
They... How did the kids
reflect back the acknowledgement

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:11.589 align:middle line:90%
that this was the person...

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:12.991 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:17.262 align:middle line:84%
Just like any other kid, would
I guess [laughter] [inaudible]

00:33:17.262 --> 00:33:18.530 align:middle line:90%
happiness, yeah.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.866 align:middle line:84%
So it just was very clear
that we had the right guy

00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:27.539 align:middle line:84%
and that we should proceed with
him, and so when I asked them

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:31.309 align:middle line:84%
about the intention, there
was a two-fold intention.

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:84%
There was an intention to
support their integration

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.049 align:middle line:84%
and then there was
also an intention

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:43.254 align:middle line:84%
to support their parents in
kind of the reduction of stress.

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:45.123 align:middle line:84%
I mean, being a parent
of a child diagnosed

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:47.859 align:middle line:84%
with autism is extremely
stressful.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:52.997 align:middle line:84%
And so we also know that we
can't raise our own vibrational

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:56.935 align:middle line:84%
frequency and be in worry,
concern, stress, fear;

00:33:56.935 --> 00:33:59.737 align:middle line:84%
the two just don't
go hand in hand.

00:33:59.737 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
two-fold intention.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.211 align:middle line:84%
So Bill met with
is unseen support

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:10.447 align:middle line:84%
and he created this very
scientific protocol,

00:34:10.447 --> 00:34:15.286 align:middle line:84%
if you will, and an intention
statement, gave it back to me

00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:17.155 align:middle line:84%
to read again, took
it back to the kids.

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:20.791 align:middle line:84%
It was a nice collaboration
and we came up with something

00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:27.232 align:middle line:84%
that is really based wholly,
solely in the frequency of love

00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:31.569 align:middle line:84%
and according to these
children's soul's purpose

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:33.805 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people want to --

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:37.208 align:middle line:84%
they hear that children have
been integrated where they --

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.777 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, "Well, do
that for my kid," you know --

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:42.813 align:middle line:84%
or have that happen
and it's not like that.

00:34:42.813 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, each one of these
souls has a unique journey

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want to
impede on that and

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:84%
yet at the same time we figured
out that we can create a space

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
that will allow them to show up
as fully as they possibly can.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and think of how
profound that's going to be

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.838 align:middle line:84%
over time when kids
like Jacob and people

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:10.508 align:middle line:84%
like Ron Davis are able to
show up in the physical world

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:13.845 align:middle line:84%
and share that kind of knowledge
with the rest of humanity.

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:16.181 align:middle line:84%
This integration process
is really critical

00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:17.849 align:middle line:84%
for our advancement
as a species.

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: It just --

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.053 align:middle line:84%
I have to stop and pinch
myself every now and again

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:26.424 align:middle line:84%
about that particular
point because it's, again,

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:32.497 align:middle line:84%
seeing how much information
is in that consciousness,

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:35.833 align:middle line:84%
seeing what they're bringing
and just because, you know,

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm noticing it it doesn't mean
that I can integrate all of it

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:42.073 align:middle line:84%
or it doesn't mean that --
but when you see that --

00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:43.842 align:middle line:84%
when you see all
that's available

00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:48.546 align:middle line:84%
for humanity moving forward, all
the positive that's available

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:53.451 align:middle line:84%
because this population
exists because they are here.

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:57.222 align:middle line:84%
It really turns the whole thing
on its head, you know, it's --

00:35:57.222 --> 00:35:59.257 align:middle line:84%
people can say, "We're
going down the wrong path

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:02.794 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we have all these
"sick kids."" I don't see it

00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:05.396 align:middle line:84%
like that in any
way, shape and form.

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:09.901 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I also see that
because they're here,

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:13.404 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity now to
have the Jacob's of the world

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:84%
to have these individuals
who can begin

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.742 align:middle line:84%
to integrate fully
into the body...

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:20.712 align:middle line:84%
...and bringing their
information with them.

00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:21.846 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: ...and begin

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.281 align:middle line:84%
to bring their information
with them.

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:24.649 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:27.518 align:middle line:84%
And, lest we think, you don't
have a heavy weight partner

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:31.155 align:middle line:84%
here, Bill Tiller is one of
the very leaders in the world

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:32.423 align:middle line:90%
in the study of consciousness --

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.859 align:middle line:84%
40 years he has been
working on this.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:37.295 align:middle line:90%
He was a professor at Stanford,

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:39.497 align:middle line:84%
materials sciences
and engineering.

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:43.234 align:middle line:84%
So no surprisingly as he's
been looking at intention

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:46.838 align:middle line:84%
and its effect on the material
world originally studying all

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:49.340 align:middle line:84%
of the Russians that we're
working in this field far

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.044 align:middle line:84%
and advance of America 30
years ago, it's not surprising

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that he has brought through
a literal technology with it

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.082 align:middle line:90%
as well, to interface with.

00:36:58.082 --> 00:37:00.184 align:middle line:84%
Can you -- and I'm going to be
interviewing him about that,

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:03.621 align:middle line:84%
but can you just kind of
introduce us to the device

00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:05.256 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit
of how that works?

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:06.591 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yes.

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:10.094 align:middle line:84%
So he created an intention
host device which I will let --

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:12.363 align:middle line:90%
he'll tell you all about...

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:14.565 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller:
...the mechanics of.

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:17.068 align:middle line:84%
But the intention host
device, unlike when you --

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:19.103 align:middle line:84%
when a bunch of people
get together and decide

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:20.672 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to hold an intention

00:37:20.672 --> 00:37:24.242 align:middle line:84%
and that has one level
of effectiveness.

00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:29.747 align:middle line:84%
But in order to have a
clear coherent intention,

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:33.484 align:middle line:84%
to place it in -- he created
this device, so it would hold

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:37.188 align:middle line:84%
that clear coherent intention
so that nothing could alter it.

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:41.059 align:middle line:84%
Right? And so the --
basically what's happening

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:84%
in this process is he and a few
other meditators are sitting

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.833 align:middle line:90%
with this intention statement

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:54.572 align:middle line:84%
and they are getting this
energetic vibrational frequency

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.007 align:middle line:90%
to a certain place.

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:56.974 align:middle line:90%
Very coherent...

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:57.875 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Very coherent...

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:90%
...intention.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.111 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: ...clear intention.

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:02.347 align:middle line:84%
And these are people who have
either been meditating together

00:38:02.347 --> 00:38:05.683 align:middle line:84%
for long periods of time or are
long time meditators themselves,

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.618 align:middle line:84%
so they know what
they're looking

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:10.621 align:middle line:90%
for as far as that space.

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:14.359 align:middle line:84%
And the minute they're with
that space, in that space,

00:38:14.359 --> 00:38:18.229 align:middle line:84%
as that space, they read
this intention statement.

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:20.164 align:middle line:90%
The intention statement is held

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:26.170 align:middle line:84%
within the intention host
device, and then it is broadcast

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:31.242 align:middle line:84%
through a scrolling computer
of names and addresses,

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:34.512 align:middle line:84%
so the computer basically
says, "Send this intention

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:38.383 align:middle line:84%
to this mother and this
child at this address";

00:38:38.383 --> 00:38:42.253 align:middle line:84%
and that is literally being
sent into their spaces

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and it is changing the space.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.126 align:middle line:84%
Well, and we're going to talk
about the effects you're seeing.

00:38:48.126 --> 00:38:51.129 align:middle line:84%
First of all, this is the first
experiment you've done together,

00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:51.963 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:51.963 --> 00:38:53.031 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yes, [inaudible].

00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:54.298 align:middle line:84%
And you're how far
into it at this point?

00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:56.067 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: We are about
right at five months now.

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:57.135 align:middle line:90%
Five months.

00:38:57.135 --> 00:38:59.404 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And how many
families are involved?

00:38:59.404 --> 00:39:01.973 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: We have 44
families that are involved.

00:39:01.973 --> 00:39:05.777 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And now let's get down
to some of the nitty-gritty.

00:39:05.777 --> 00:39:07.912 align:middle line:84%
So this broadcasting
has been going on.

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:12.116 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what did you and
Dr. Tiller expect at the outset?

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:13.418 align:middle line:90%
Or was there an expectation?

00:39:13.418 --> 00:39:16.487 align:middle line:84%
We know that expectation
also affects the outcome

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:19.290 align:middle line:84%
but what did you
think might happen?

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.759 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Well, I'm not --

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.928 align:middle line:84%
we knew that it --
well, we didn't know.

00:39:23.928 --> 00:39:28.099 align:middle line:84%
We suspected that there
would be some positive impact

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.500 align:middle line:84%
for the child -- or
at least we hoped

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.503 align:middle line:84%
that there would be some
positive impact for the child.

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:36.841 align:middle line:84%
As a pediatrics speech language
pathologist, I personally

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:40.278 align:middle line:84%
as we were looking through the
list of things that might change

00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:44.015 align:middle line:84%
in this process, I personally
thought communication would be

00:39:44.015 --> 00:39:46.918 align:middle line:84%
one of the last things
that would change.

00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:50.254 align:middle line:84%
Communication is really
challenging on a --

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:54.225 align:middle line:84%
in a time space reality it's
very challenging; and yet,

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:57.328 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things that
did occur were children began

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.563 align:middle line:90%
to talk.

00:39:58.563 --> 00:40:01.799 align:middle line:84%
So they either began to talk
or if they were talking,

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:06.938 align:middle line:84%
they began to have much
broader vocabularies,

00:40:06.938 --> 00:40:09.273 align:middle line:90%
broader sentence structure.

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:12.977 align:middle line:84%
Some children who are non
verbal started using facilitated

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:16.447 align:middle line:84%
communication to either
for the first time

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:18.249 align:middle line:90%
or to a greater degree.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:23.921 align:middle line:84%
So this is something, I mean, in
the mainstream educational world

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:90%
that should not be possible.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.394 align:middle line:84%
Right. And this is significant
increases in the data.

00:40:30.394 --> 00:40:31.729 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Absolutely.

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:34.732 align:middle line:84%
I mean, somewhere you're looking
at an increase of anywhere

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:40.872 align:middle line:84%
from 35, 40% to 65, 70% in some
of these areas of function.

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:42.073 align:middle line:90%
Let's go through some of them.

00:40:42.073 --> 00:40:42.707 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Okay.

00:40:42.707 --> 00:40:43.407 align:middle line:90%
Eye contact.

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.609 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yes.

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:47.111 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes there's
not a lot of connection.

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.246 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Right.

00:40:48.246 --> 00:40:50.014 align:middle line:84%
So when we have -- you
know, when we're looking

00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:55.486 align:middle line:84%
at eye contact and initially we
get a percentage like, you know,

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:59.190 align:middle line:84%
only 24% of the population
makes --

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.626 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
population makes eye contact

00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:02.894 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:41:02.894 --> 00:41:06.464 align:middle line:84%
And then we go, you know,
four months out or so

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:10.134 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing something like,
you know, 48% or, you know,

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:13.871 align:middle line:84%
a huge jump in the
amount of change.

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:15.806 align:middle line:90%
Eye contact, we also...

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.208 align:middle line:90%
What about affection levels?

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:19.143 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Yeah,
that piece is --

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:23.681 align:middle line:84%
that's the wonderful piece
because so many parents

00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:26.484 align:middle line:84%
of children diagnosed
with autism feel

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:27.885 align:middle line:90%
that separation, you know.

00:41:27.885 --> 00:41:30.321 align:middle line:84%
They feel that their
children are somewhere else,

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:34.425 align:middle line:84%
so the affection piece even
in the anecdotal information

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:39.263 align:middle line:84%
that we receive, we're seeing,
you know, parents saying

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:41.732 align:middle line:84%
that there's this cuddling,
there's this hugging,

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:45.536 align:middle line:84%
there's this interest
in their families,

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:84%
interaction with siblings, you
know, coming to them and wanting

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.243 align:middle line:84%
to be present with them,
which is a huge change.

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:55.713 align:middle line:84%
That is. I have a member of
our family who was diagnosed

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:59.584 align:middle line:84%
as Asperger's and she's doing
-- she's in college now.

00:41:59.584 --> 00:42:02.653 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly when she
was growing up, she had --

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:04.455 align:middle line:84%
kind of no boundaries
that were just --

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:07.992 align:middle line:84%
it was very odd kind
of boundaries.

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:10.061 align:middle line:90%
And she started mimicking.

00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:11.529 align:middle line:90%
When it came to affection,

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:14.098 align:middle line:84%
I noticed what she would do is
watch how other people showed

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:18.135 align:middle line:84%
affection to each other and
then she would watch and go over

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:20.671 align:middle line:84%
and then imitate
that for affection.

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:22.039 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't genuine.

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:25.176 align:middle line:84%
She was just trying to find
ways to fit in with other people

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:29.146 align:middle line:84%
but what you're talking
about are genuine connections

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:31.449 align:middle line:84%
that are taking place it
sounds like among these kids.

00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:33.417 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Well, and they're
so [inaudible], as well.

00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:35.853 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller: You
know, so these are parents

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:37.788 align:middle line:84%
who are saying he
didn't do this.

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:41.892 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a sudden he's
hugging on to the back of my leg

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:44.095 align:middle line:84%
as I'm washing the dishes
or that kind of thing.

00:42:44.095 --> 00:42:48.032 align:middle line:84%
So, and, you know, again, for a
parent who hasn't had that kind

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:51.736 align:middle line:84%
of interaction with
their child, it's huge.

00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:53.804 align:middle line:84%
It's huge on a very
personal level.

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:55.439 align:middle line:90%
Yes. And what about also --

00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:58.676 align:middle line:84%
where you said language
to begin with,

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:01.312 align:middle line:84%
the ability to start
articulating what's going

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:03.881 align:middle line:84%
on inside their heads, you're
seeing big increases in that.

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:06.517 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: We're
definitely seeing increases.

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:90%
There was young man that she --

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.391 align:middle line:84%
the mother was saying that
in the past, for instance,

00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:16.961 align:middle line:84%
he might use language but he
might say over and over again,

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:18.763 align:middle line:84%
you know, he wanted
something for Christmas

00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:20.297 align:middle line:90%
or he was wanting -- what was

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:21.966 align:middle line:84%
on his birthday list,
that kind of thing.

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:25.002 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Suzy Miller: But -- so
he was using communication

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.937 align:middle line:84%
and he was accurately
saying what he would

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:30.641 align:middle line:84%
like to have happen and that was
repeated over and over again.

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:33.144 align:middle line:84%
But during the autism
intention program,

00:43:33.144 --> 00:43:36.247 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden he began
saying things like, "Well,

00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:37.748 align:middle line:84%
what would you like
for Christmas?"

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:38.949 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's a whole
different direction.

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.284 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: That's a
whole different ballgame.

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:41.419 align:middle line:90%
That's real engagement.

00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:43.154 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Yeah,
because now communication

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:46.957 align:middle line:84%
and language is being used
as a relationship builder,

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:50.528 align:middle line:84%
as an interaction on
a very human level.

00:43:50.528 --> 00:43:54.832 align:middle line:84%
It's not just this wrote
verbalization, and that's one

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:56.333 align:middle line:84%
of the things that's
really common

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.935 align:middle line:84%
for children diagnosed
with autism.

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:02.773 align:middle line:84%
They may learn the language,
so to speak, but it's so wrote

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:05.609 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't always have
that feeling of, you know,

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:08.446 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually just establishing
a relationship with you

00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:09.213 align:middle line:90%
because I'm using it as words.

00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:10.681 align:middle line:90%
It's more repeating words.

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:11.849 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.684 align:middle line:84%
Right. Now, what
about the parents?

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:18.389 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking about
how this signal, so to speak,

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:23.728 align:middle line:84%
this intention, carried in this
frequency generation device is

00:44:23.728 --> 00:44:28.833 align:middle line:84%
being carried with the ID of
names and addresses, which,

00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:31.102 align:middle line:84%
you know, letters, numbers,
all these things are part

00:44:31.102 --> 00:44:32.670 align:middle line:84%
of the universal
building blocks of life.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.071 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:36.507 align:middle line:84%
So it's finding its way into the
household, so we were hearing

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.476 align:middle line:84%
about some of the
effects of kids and I want

00:44:38.476 --> 00:44:42.213 align:middle line:84%
to get a little bit more
into the general trending

00:44:42.213 --> 00:44:43.814 align:middle line:84%
because you're only five
minutes in, but let's talk

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:46.150 align:middle line:84%
about the rest of the family
and the parents for a moment.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.951 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Right.

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:47.952 align:middle line:90%
They're in that house, too.

00:44:47.952 --> 00:44:49.487 align:middle line:84%
How are they receiving
these signals?

00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:50.621 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:53.924 align:middle line:84%
What they are -- a
couple of different ways.

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:56.193 align:middle line:84%
We're actually seeing something
different in the parents

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:58.629 align:middle line:84%
than we are actually in
the kids that we're going

00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:02.133 align:middle line:84%
to be making an adjustment
for starting in June.

00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:04.034 align:middle line:90%
But generally speaking,

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:08.038 align:middle line:84%
the parents that are having some
really positive impacts so far,

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:11.909 align:middle line:84%
they're saying things like,
you know, just easier,

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:14.845 align:middle line:84%
more aware of their
children's strengths

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.547 align:middle line:90%
versus their weaknesses.

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.681 align:middle line:90%
You know, we have a tendency

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.784 align:middle line:84%
to see what's wrong
some of the time...

00:45:19.784 --> 00:45:21.519 align:middle line:84%
Sure. Suzy Miller: ...and all
of a sudden it's like, "Oh,

00:45:21.519 --> 00:45:26.157 align:middle line:84%
I can see that something is
there that wasn't there before."

00:45:26.157 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:84%
We're also having
parents say, you know,

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.263 align:middle line:84%
just their own personal
relationships, you know.

00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:35.099 align:middle line:84%
Husband and wife relationships
are really challenging

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:39.003 align:middle line:84%
when you have a child that
has this kind of difficulty,

00:45:39.003 --> 00:45:42.573 align:middle line:84%
and so we're seeing some
positive impact there as well.

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:45.576 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I thought
was fascinating, however,

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:48.012 align:middle line:90%
is that the children,

00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:53.451 align:middle line:84%
every three months we imprint
the intention and we do

00:45:53.451 --> 00:45:57.421 align:middle line:84%
that because Dr. Tiller found
that there could be a little bit

00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:01.692 align:middle line:84%
of leakage in the
holding of that intention.

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:03.994 align:middle line:84%
And so every three
months we re-imprint it.

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that also is
really wonderful

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.932 align:middle line:84%
because every three
months we can kind

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:09.333 align:middle line:84%
of up the ante just
a little bit.

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:13.404 align:middle line:84%
We can change it according
to what we're seeing so far.

00:46:13.404 --> 00:46:17.608 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that the
children said for June is

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:21.812 align:middle line:84%
that their parents function
in time and space, okay?

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:25.149 align:middle line:84%
They're entangled
in time and space,

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:28.886 align:middle line:84%
and so they actually need
a little bit more time,

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:31.989 align:middle line:84%
literal time, with
the intention.

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:34.692 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be
broadcasting that intention

00:46:34.692 --> 00:46:39.263 align:middle line:84%
to them almost double what
we have currently been doing.

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:42.433 align:middle line:84%
This started because we
were asking the children,

00:46:42.433 --> 00:46:46.036 align:middle line:84%
"Is this amount of
time ample time for --

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:47.671 align:middle line:84%
" and we were directing
it to them;

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:50.407 align:middle line:84%
"Are you getting ample
time with this intention?"

00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:53.043 align:middle line:84%
And they came back
with something

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:55.479 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't quite
expect which I always liked

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:59.350 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't make it
up, is they said, "You know,

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:03.153 align:middle line:84%
we function outside of time
and space, so we really --

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:06.257 align:middle line:84%
you can play with whatever
time you would like as far

00:47:06.257 --> 00:47:08.492 align:middle line:84%
as we're concerned
in that broadcast.

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:13.497 align:middle line:84%
What we need from you is a clear
coherent intention that is based

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.766 align:middle line:84%
in love, that is
based in this --

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:18.235 align:middle line:84%
you know, according
to the soul's purpose.

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll keep that intention
clear, we'll be doing great

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.141 align:middle line:90%
and we're watching that.

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:26.777 align:middle line:84%
We're already watching with the
time that we give them right now

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:29.713 align:middle line:84%
that they are really
making some nice progress.

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:33.817 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "And in
order to help us even more,

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:37.288 align:middle line:84%
you could give the parents
more time because, like I say,

00:47:37.288 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:84%
they function in
time and space."

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:44.328 align:middle line:84%
And so for them to
unravel, you know, some --

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:47.965 align:middle line:84%
what does it mean to
have a child diagnosed

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:49.600 align:middle line:90%
with autism, you know?

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.602 align:middle line:84%
And what does society
say that means

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and what do the educators...

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.104 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the expectation
is just so...

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.139 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Oh, it's, yeah.

00:47:55.139 --> 00:47:56.240 align:middle line:90%
...difficult.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.641 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: It's so
difficult and there's

00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:01.211 align:middle line:84%
so much entanglement, there's so
much drawn down of their energy;

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:03.580 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time
they're trying to move

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.718 align:middle line:84%
into a higher state of
awareness to be in this kind

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.987 align:middle line:84%
of coupled space
with their children.

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:11.522 align:middle line:90%
They're also being drawn

00:48:11.522 --> 00:48:13.924 align:middle line:84%
by the entanglements
of the collective...

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:14.992 align:middle line:90%
Belief system.

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: ...belief
systems, exactly.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.631 align:middle line:84%
So by giving them a little bit
more time, broadcasting this

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:24.168 align:middle line:84%
for longer periods of time,
they get the opportunity

00:48:24.168 --> 00:48:27.871 align:middle line:84%
to hold their belief system,
their new belief system,

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:31.241 align:middle line:84%
anchor it in a little
more effectively.

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:33.243 align:middle line:84%
So now, most of these parents
that are coming to you,

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:38.048 align:middle line:84%
do they jive with you on the
conceptual areas such as,

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:39.450 align:middle line:90%
"Look, your kids are coming.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.185 align:middle line:84%
They're living in
another dimensional field.

00:48:41.185 --> 00:48:43.787 align:middle line:84%
They just have a kind of
their toe into this vehicle --

00:48:43.787 --> 00:48:46.256 align:middle line:84%
this little body,
this little bio suit,

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:49.493 align:middle line:84%
that they're using here
on earth at this time."

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:51.161 align:middle line:90%
Do the parents get that?

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:53.864 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they comfortable
with these concepts,

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:56.567 align:middle line:84%
these more esoteric concepts
even though they're steeped

00:48:56.567 --> 00:48:57.267 align:middle line:90%
in science?

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:58.402 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:01.171 align:middle line:84%
This initial group of
44, I think, you know,

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:04.775 align:middle line:84%
when we put this in -- when
we put the autism intention

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:08.479 align:middle line:84%
experiment out in the first
place, we were obviously going

00:49:08.479 --> 00:49:11.048 align:middle line:84%
to attract to us people
who could kind of --

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:14.218 align:middle line:84%
especially this first group
who can really get that,

00:49:14.218 --> 00:49:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and they do to a certain degree.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.124 align:middle line:84%
I think they are learning all
kinds of things along the way

00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:22.693 align:middle line:90%
as well, because they're also --

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:24.061 align:middle line:90%
you know, something simple

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:29.166 align:middle line:84%
like when I say the last
adjustment we made was

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.968 align:middle line:90%
for their emotional body.

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:34.638 align:middle line:84%
So we're -- you've got a
parent who's being asked

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:38.709 align:middle line:84%
to see something different
and they conceptually can get

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.210 align:middle line:90%
"I can see something different."

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.145 align:middle line:90%
They mentally...

00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:42.479 align:middle line:84%
They're still expecting
the same.

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:43.647 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller: ...but they're
still expecting something

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:46.183 align:middle line:84%
and they're still
waiting for the experience

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:49.319 align:middle line:84%
and that whole waiting for
the experience has a tendency

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.588 align:middle line:84%
to push them away from
the experience, right?

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:54.224 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller: So
what's really interesting

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:57.161 align:middle line:84%
in the last change that
we made is we made it

00:49:57.161 --> 00:50:01.932 align:middle line:84%
so that they didn't have to rely
on their emotional body so much

00:50:01.932 --> 00:50:03.834 align:middle line:84%
when they're going
through this transition

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:06.904 align:middle line:84%
that they could rely more
on their higher states

00:50:06.904 --> 00:50:08.972 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
to support them.

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:11.308 align:middle line:84%
That made a really
nice difference.

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.544 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden it was
like, "Ah, I can relax."

00:50:13.544 --> 00:50:16.113 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't have to
wait for something to happen.

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:20.384 align:middle line:84%
I can just simply witness it
happening as it's happening.

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:22.252 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't this
expectation like you say.

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:23.587 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:27.925 align:middle line:84%
And now this experiment has
another seven months to go,

00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:31.128 align:middle line:84%
with -- from the beginning
until now, the five-month mark,

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:32.730 align:middle line:90%
what is the trajectory?

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:33.964 align:middle line:90%
Are you seeing kind

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:38.202 align:middle line:84%
of exponential improvements
or how is this going?

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:41.071 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: We are
definitely seeing improvements.

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:44.475 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, communication seemed
to be the thing that showed

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:47.611 align:middle line:84%
up first and I expected
it to be last.

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:50.314 align:middle line:84%
But also right behind
communication was

00:50:50.314 --> 00:50:52.983 align:middle line:84%
like a greater sense of
presence, a greater sense

00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:55.986 align:middle line:84%
of awareness within their
physical environment,

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:57.955 align:middle line:90%
which is also huge.

00:50:57.955 --> 00:51:01.925 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, of the 44
families, we do have a majority

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:04.895 align:middle line:84%
of them that are seeing some
of them seeing subtle changes,

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:07.631 align:middle line:84%
some of them seeing
immense changes,

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and I think sometimes
the changes

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.902 align:middle line:84%
that are occurring
also have to do

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:14.505 align:middle line:84%
with where these parents
came into this process.

00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:16.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of them
had already let go of some

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:21.245 align:middle line:84%
of the expectation and
therefore they are able

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:23.213 align:middle line:84%
to see all kinds
of amazing things.

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:24.781 align:middle line:90%
So it's been fascinating.

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:27.351 align:middle line:84%
And very soon you have a
second experiment coming

00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:28.886 align:middle line:90%
up beginning in July sometime.

00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:29.653 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: That's right.

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:30.788 align:middle line:90%
Right? Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:51:30.788 --> 00:51:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And now, how -- I'm sure
many people listening,

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:34.925 align:middle line:84%
how can they become
involved and,

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.059 align:middle line:90%
you know, what does it take?

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:38.962 align:middle line:84%
What are you looking for
in them or the child?

00:51:38.962 --> 00:51:40.330 align:middle line:84%
What does it take
to become involved?

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:41.598 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yep.

00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:45.035 align:middle line:84%
We -- I have opened this
autism intention program

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:47.137 align:middle line:84%
to a different population
this time.

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:48.405 align:middle line:90%
Last time it was -- they had

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:51.775 align:middle line:84%
to have a medical and/or
educational diagnosis of autism.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:55.846 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Suzy Miller: This time,
that works beautifully but also,

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:58.348 align:middle line:84%
we're opening it to
families who have children

00:51:58.348 --> 00:52:01.251 align:middle line:84%
who have characteristics
of autism

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:02.819 align:middle line:90%
but are not yet diagnosed.

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:08.125 align:middle line:84%
And that's a huge piece because
what we were finding is parents

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:10.160 align:middle line:90%
-- for one reason or another,

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.463 align:middle line:84%
parents either do not want
their child to be diagnosed...

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:14.598 align:middle line:90%
For good reason and more...

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:15.365 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Right,
because of -- yeah.

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes. And because of the...

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.068 align:middle line:90%
Entrapped in our system.

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:19.503 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: It just
creates -- it --

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:21.171 align:middle line:90%
well a system and a belief.

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Suzy Miller: You know,
you get trapped in that bubble

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.410 align:middle line:84%
of autism and it's very
hard to get out of it.

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:30.214 align:middle line:84%
So that was one piece, but the
other pieces that the parents

00:52:30.214 --> 00:52:33.250 align:middle line:84%
of children who did
want to diagnose this,

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:36.887 align:middle line:84%
they were having a really hard
time getting the diagnosis.

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:39.389 align:middle line:84%
And so if they wanted
it for the reason

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:44.861 align:middle line:84%
of getting extra support or,
you know, educational treatments

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:50.167 align:middle line:84%
or things like that, they were
waiting a really long time and,

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.936 align:middle line:84%
you know, Bill actually came
to me with this one and said,

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:54.304 align:middle line:84%
"You know, I think
we should open it

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:57.875 align:middle line:84%
up because quite frankly,
if everything goes

00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:01.345 align:middle line:84%
as it's been going, then
these children who are not

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:04.314 align:middle line:84%
yet diagnosed but have these
significant characteristics,

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:06.883 align:middle line:84%
by the time they
would get diagnosed,

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:07.918 align:middle line:90%
some of those characteristics...

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:09.219 align:middle line:90%
...be integrated.

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:10.587 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Exactly.

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:14.591 align:middle line:84%
And so how many families will
you be able to take in this?

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how -- what's
the capacity

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.829 align:middle line:90%
of this broadcast system?

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Well, we are
going to move to 200 families

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:28.071 align:middle line:84%
for this next one that begins
in July and we have gone

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:31.208 align:middle line:84%
through all the processes of
automating all of the things

00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:35.145 align:middle line:84%
that we need to automate
so that we can take care

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:37.347 align:middle line:90%
of that many families.

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:39.516 align:middle line:90%
So I'm looking forward to it.

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:42.653 align:middle line:84%
Quite frankly, once
we do this, I mean,

00:53:42.653 --> 00:53:46.924 align:middle line:84%
I really think we could
be broadcasting to autism,

00:53:46.924 --> 00:53:48.558 align:middle line:84%
you know, we could
be broadcasting

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:51.561 align:middle line:90%
to a much broader population.

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:54.965 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that we're
necessarily going to be limited

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:56.900 align:middle line:84%
by how many we can
broadcast, too.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.435 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense
because if you're talking

00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:00.637 align:middle line:84%
about broadcasting
into a nonphysical --

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:02.973 align:middle line:84%
completely nonphysical
dimension --

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:08.045 align:middle line:84%
or frequency, then all of those
beings incarnating at this time

00:54:08.045 --> 00:54:10.814 align:middle line:84%
in this way should be able
to dial into that band,

00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:12.382 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, by their own will.

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: Well,
not only that.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:18.388 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe that the kids
kind of knew this was coming...

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:19.656 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Suzy Miller: ...as well.

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:21.892 align:middle line:84%
It's -- you know, they
incarnate at a particular time

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:24.628 align:middle line:84%
and they also know that
when they incarnate

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:26.163 align:middle line:90%
at a particular time,

00:54:26.163 --> 00:54:29.566 align:middle line:84%
those forerunners obviously
are going to have challenges.

00:54:29.566 --> 00:54:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But as the masses come in,
that consciousness itself is,

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.639 align:middle line:84%
you know, we are
the new technology.

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:39.009 align:middle line:84%
Right. Suzy Miller: You know, so
here's the new technology and --

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:42.479 align:middle line:84%
so it's -- one interfaces
with the other.

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:43.847 align:middle line:90%
They know to come at this time

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:46.016 align:middle line:84%
because the technology
will be available

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:48.085 align:middle line:84%
and the technology
knows to be available

00:54:48.085 --> 00:54:49.019 align:middle line:84%
at this time because
they're here.

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:50.487 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Suzy Miller: So...

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about the
practical element, the cost

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:56.193 align:middle line:84%
or fees involved and being
involved with the program.

00:54:56.193 --> 00:54:57.527 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yep.

00:54:57.527 --> 00:55:01.198 align:middle line:84%
It's -- again, it's a year-long
program and it's somewhere

00:55:01.198 --> 00:55:05.736 align:middle line:84%
around 700, 750 a year
for the year which is...

00:55:05.736 --> 00:55:07.070 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.139 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: It's ridiculously
wonderful and I'm thrilled

00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:11.208 align:middle line:90%
that we can do it at this level.

00:55:11.208 --> 00:55:13.643 align:middle line:84%
People can pay for
that quarterly.

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:16.713 align:middle line:84%
They can pay two
payments for that year.

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.382 align:middle line:90%
They sign up.

00:55:18.382 --> 00:55:24.855 align:middle line:84%
Every parent on a monthly basis
is asked to fill out two forms.

00:55:24.855 --> 00:55:29.993 align:middle line:84%
One is called an ATEC which
looks at treatment for --

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:35.365 align:middle line:84%
it's Autism Treatment Evaluation
Checklist; and so it's looking

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:38.602 align:middle line:84%
at how effective is this
broadcast basically.

00:55:38.602 --> 00:55:43.040 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at communication,
socialization, motor skills,

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.341 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:49.479 align:middle line:84%
There's also a checklist for
the parent and we decided

00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to use the Zung anxiety
checklist

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.085 align:middle line:90%
and it's a self-checklist.

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:57.621 align:middle line:84%
They kind of go down and
they let us know kind

00:55:57.621 --> 00:55:59.389 align:middle line:84%
of where they're starting
and then they have

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.591 align:middle line:90%
to fill this out every month.

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:04.661 align:middle line:84%
As it is now, actually
starting this month

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:07.564 align:middle line:84%
for the current group,
everything is automated

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:10.300 align:middle line:84%
so they can literally do
this on their iPhones,

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.368 align:middle line:90%
you know, if they want.

00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:13.236 align:middle line:84%
They can literally
pull up the link and go

00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:15.672 align:middle line:90%
through and check these off.

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:19.976 align:middle line:84%
Everything's automated so
it makes that much easier.

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:23.747 align:middle line:84%
And so they go through
this process for one year.

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:28.652 align:middle line:84%
Bill and I are offering monthly
tele calls, so anybody can come

00:56:28.652 --> 00:56:31.655 align:middle line:84%
on the call; they can say,
"Hey, this is what's happening,"

00:56:31.655 --> 00:56:35.992 align:middle line:84%
or "I have a question about
this"; and we can kind of,

00:56:35.992 --> 00:56:39.563 align:middle line:84%
you know, at least share
from our perspective what

00:56:39.563 --> 00:56:43.733 align:middle line:84%
that might be about, so that
they can have some consciousness

00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.402 align:middle line:90%
around what's going on.

00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:48.638 align:middle line:84%
They also have a
Facebook community

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:50.640 align:middle line:84%
where it's a private
Facebook community

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.210 align:middle line:84%
where that they can interact
with other people who are going

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:55.045 align:middle line:90%
through the process, as well.

00:56:55.045 --> 00:56:58.648 align:middle line:84%
And what we've found in this
first group which was --

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:02.419 align:middle line:84%
not surprising in one way
but it really showed up,

00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:05.021 align:middle line:84%
is that the people that are
in the private Facebook group,

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:09.192 align:middle line:84%
they're supporting each other
through the ups and the downs,

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:12.062 align:middle line:84%
you know, of this
year-long process,

00:57:12.062 --> 00:57:16.766 align:middle line:84%
and they're really doing
very well as a group

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:19.970 align:middle line:84%
versus necessarily, some
of the people that are kind

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:22.072 align:middle line:84%
of have isolated
themselves a little bit more.

00:57:22.072 --> 00:57:23.373 align:middle line:90%
Right. No, that makes sense.

00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:26.276 align:middle line:84%
You know, to me, one of the
exciting things about all

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:29.279 align:middle line:84%
of this is that I
find it hopeful.

00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:34.351 align:middle line:84%
If you have beings of this
level of frequency, refinement,

00:57:34.351 --> 00:57:37.621 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, whatever you want
to call it, trying to integrate

00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:41.124 align:middle line:84%
into the physical world
as dense as it is --

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:44.327 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly there are
some challenges going on.

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:47.163 align:middle line:84%
That has to bode
well for our future.

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:49.799 align:middle line:84%
Why would they be
investing themselves in this

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:53.303 align:middle line:84%
if there wasn't some major
upliftment at the end of it?

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.671 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Yeah.

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:58.975 align:middle line:84%
It think we're heading to a very
bright future quite frankly.

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:01.311 align:middle line:84%
I mean, since I began
communicating

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.313 align:middle line:90%
with this consciousness,

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:07.217 align:middle line:84%
there has never been
anything negative.

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, challenges, yes, I mean,
you can look at their own lives

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.924 align:middle line:84%
and you can see, "Yes, we all
go through challenges and, yes,

00:58:13.924 --> 00:58:15.358 align:middle line:90%
we all go through changes."

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:17.627 align:middle line:84%
But you look at a
population that's coming

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:18.929 align:middle line:90%
in mass right now...

00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Suzy Miller:
...I mean, really...

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.466 align:middle line:84%
We're talking -- we're at 2% of
the little ones being born now.

00:58:23.466 --> 00:58:24.668 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:26.603 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: That's huge
and if you've got that big

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:30.440 align:middle line:84%
of a population showing
up, again, this trajectory,

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.675 align:middle line:90%
and kind of turning the corner

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:33.743 align:middle line:84%
and let's go back to
who we really are.

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:36.346 align:middle line:90%
Right. Suzy Miller: And it's --

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:39.516 align:middle line:84%
I think it's somewhat
confusing right now simply

00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:43.219 align:middle line:84%
because you look at a population
who does have challenges

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:46.923 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body and in
the mental body as according

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:50.927 align:middle line:84%
to "What we're supposed to be
like," and yet when you look

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:55.465 align:middle line:84%
at what they're bringing
dimensionally,

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:58.501 align:middle line:90%
what they're very well versed...

00:58:58.501 --> 00:58:59.603 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:58:59.603 --> 00:59:01.004 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller: ...and
that in those realms.

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.706 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. It's just a matter of
our understanding it the new way

00:59:02.706 --> 00:59:04.808 align:middle line:84%
and then creating a new
value system ourselves.

00:59:04.808 --> 00:59:06.776 align:middle line:84%
And on that, we're
out of time and I want

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.044 align:middle line:90%
to thank you so much, Suzy.

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:11.982 align:middle line:84%
And when you and Bill are
done, and the first study

00:59:11.982 --> 00:59:14.217 align:middle line:84%
or even the second one is done
and dusted, I hope you come back

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:16.853 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what some of
the results have been.

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:17.621 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: I'd love to.

00:59:17.621 --> 00:59:18.521 align:middle line:90%
Thanks. Thank you so much.

00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:19.923 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller: Thanks.

00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:22.359 align:middle line:84%
If you have an autistic child
or in connection with someone

00:59:22.359 --> 00:59:25.261 align:middle line:84%
who does, this might be a
source of incredible solace

00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:27.163 align:middle line:84%
to share this information
with them.

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:29.966 align:middle line:84%
If they choose to become
involved, they can research Suzy

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.635 align:middle line:90%
through suzymiller.com.

00:59:33.203 --> 00:59:37.173 align:middle line:84%
and constantly offering new
information in education

00:59:37.173 --> 00:59:39.909 align:middle line:84%
of an extraordinary nature;
it's growing every day.
