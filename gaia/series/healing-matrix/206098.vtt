00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Silver amalgam fillings,
does it contain mercury?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:10%
>> It does.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Why is it that the ADIA
will not tell the public that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:10%
mercury amalgam is harmful?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD GROUP: Our
guest, Dr. Blanche Grube,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:10%
shared with us the work of her
mentor Dr. Hal Huggins, who

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:10%
was one of the first
to uncover just how

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:10%
harmful mercury is to the body.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll dive further into
this vitally important subject.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
here, Dr. Blanche.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BLANCHE GRUBE: Thank you.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.723 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:02.807 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So tell us
what exactly is mercury?

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well,
mercury is an element.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a naturally forming
element in God's planet.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%
It is found in the Earth.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.163 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What
makes it so toxic?

00:01:13.163 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUBE: To keep
it very simple, I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:10%
would say one molecule, one atom
of mercury, can kill one cell.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:10%
The difference is after
that cell is gone,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:10%
then that same molecule
or atom of mercury

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:10%
then goes on and
kills another cell.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
makes it so toxic.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for the
body to get rid of the mercury

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:90%
once it's inside.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how was mercury
implemented in dentistry?

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUBE: The Crawcour
brothers discovered

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:10%
that if you took some nickel
shavings, literally shavings

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:10%
from a nickel, nickel
shavings and mixed it

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:10%
with mercury, after
a few minutes,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:10%
the combination of those
two elements would get hard.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:10%
And so I don't know
what made them-- maybe

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:10%
they had a few too many
glasses of wine that night,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:10%
but they said, gee, let's
use this to fill the holes

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.452 align:middle line:10%
in people's teeth.

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: What year was that?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Now that was about--
well, was 1834 in Europe.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
By the time it really became
popular here in the United

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:90%
States, it was the late 1920s.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.257 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And how did
that term become amalgam?

00:02:18.257 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Well that's what it is.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a chemical term.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
An amalgam is a mixture
of different metals

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:90%
joined together.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
word amalgam comes from.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
In our world, amalgam
always in dentistry

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
always means mercury mixed with
silver, tin, copper, and zinc.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have four
different shavings

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.760 align:middle line:90%
of metal mixed with mercury.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
The day it's made,
it's 54% mercury.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:84%
The other 46% is the
little metal shavings.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So just to be clear,
silver fillings and mercury

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.273 align:middle line:90%
fillings--

00:02:59.273 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Are the same.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: --are the same?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And silver fillings really
only have about 15% silver.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Why do we call them
silver fillings?

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We should rightfully call
them mercury fillings.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: When did
the evidence first

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
come out that mercury
fillings were actually bad?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I think since
the beginning of time.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Since scientists began
looking at the elements

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and the elemental
table was developed,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:90%
they knew that mercury was bad.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Crawcour
brothers brought amalgam over

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to New York, everybody
knew it was bad.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But they were stubborn
and they continued

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.093 align:middle line:90%
to push their theories.

00:03:37.093 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had a lot of
dentists who said, well,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
do you know what, this
is much easier than doing

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:90%
a gold filling.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:90%
It's much easier.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:90%
It's much cheaper.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do that.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Now at that period of time,
you had two different kinds

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:90%
of dentists.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
You had the dentist who
was a medical doctor who

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
also did dentistry almost
as a side specialty.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you had the everyday
barber who also did dentistry.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
that, in those days,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
the barbers were the ones
who liked amalgam, because it

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:90%
was cheap and easy to use.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And they were called
the quacks, because they

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
used quecksilber, which is
the German word for mercury.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:90%
So they were called the quacks.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And the regular MDs, Medical
Doctors, who did dentistry,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.897 align:middle line:90%
were not the quacks.

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Were they buying that
from a company at that time or

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:90%
were they actually making it?

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: They were actually
making it themselves.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Wow.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.508 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: They were
actually shaving

00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
the nickel
themselves, the coins,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and mixing the mercury with it.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they all died
young, because it was so toxic.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Let's now
take a step back in time

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and learn a bit about
the history of dentistry

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:90%
as it's practiced in the US.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
What you're about to see is
from a powerful documentary

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.135 align:middle line:90%
called evidence of harm.

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:54.660 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:10%
>>In the early 1800s, s
organized dentistry was still

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:10%
in its infancy.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:10%
As there were no dental
schools or licensing boards,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:10%
it was common that craftsmen,
such as the local barber

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:10%
or blacksmith, might also
practice dentistry, which,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.580 align:middle line:10%
at the time, amounted to little
more than having teeth pulled

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:10%
or gold fillings
placed in cavities.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.030 align:middle line:10%
Dental mercury's introduction
to the United States

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:10%
came in 1833 by the
Crawcour brothers of France.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:10%
They called it royal mineral
succedaneum, a handmade mixture

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:10%
of melted silver coin shavings
and elemental mercury.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:10%
The lower cost of
this combination

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.610 align:middle line:10%
of mercury with another metal,
otherwise known as an amalgam,

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:10%
enabled a larger portion
of the population

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:10%
to afford the services
of those dentists who

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.715 align:middle line:10%
used amalgam fillings.

00:05:45.715 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:10%


00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:10%
But a bitter controversy started
brewing over the use of mercury

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:10%
as a restorative material.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:10%
And by 1843, the world's first
national dental organization,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:10%
the American Society
of Dental Surgeons,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:10%
passed a resolution stating
that the use of amalgam

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:10%
was considered to
be malpractice.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:10%
The American Society
of Dental Surgeons

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:10%
asked members to
sign a pledge never

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:10%
to place what the
organization referred to

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:10%
as poison metal fillings.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.785 align:middle line:10%
And those members who did use
amalgam risked being expelled.

00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:10%


00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:10%
And by 1856, the American
Society of dental surgeons

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:10%
disbanded.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:10%
In its place rose the American
Dental Association in 1859,

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:10%
which, to this day,
continues to promote

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.465 align:middle line:10%
the safety of mercury fillings.

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: That was the
beginning of Amalgam War I.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what
is Amalgam War I?

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.615 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well,
you had the battle

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
between the medical doctors who
were scientifically oriented

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
who said, wait a minute,
you can't put mercury

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:90%
into a human body.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.325 align:middle line:90%
You're going to kill the person.

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
If you have a little
bit of arsenic every day

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:84%
in your coffee,
it will kill you.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:90%
And the same is true of mercury.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So you had the medical
doctors who said,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
you can't put mercury
in somebody's mouth.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you had the barber
dentists or the quacks

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:90%
who were very much in favor.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
as history proved,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
the quacks grew faster in
number than the American Dental

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Society grew.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the
American Dental Society

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.340 align:middle line:90%
fell out of favor.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Medicine then separated
itself from dentistry.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So right from the beginning,
the American Dental Association

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:84%
has always been in
favor of using amalgam.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What was
Amalgam War II?

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Amalgam War II
came across when a doctor

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Alfred Stock--

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:90%
he was a German doctor--

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
he began looking just
before World War I,

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
he began looking at the
toxicity of mercury.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And he started
writing some papers.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And so then there was
a lot said about it.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot
of arguments made.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, the War broke
out and it got forgotten again.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And it stayed quiet until 1984
when Dr. Hal Huggins published

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:90%
a book "It's All In Your Head".

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of Amalgam War III.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Huggins had met in 1973, Dr.
Huggins had gone to Mexico City

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.900 align:middle line:90%
to give a lecture on nutrition.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Huggins was always
interested in nutrition

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and its relationship
to dentistry,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:90%
which was a great thing.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So he was actually one of
the favorites of the American

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Dental Association at that time,
because he was one of the few

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:90%
who was talking about nutrition.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
He was talking about nutrition
and he showed a few slides

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
where the patient
did not get better.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
With fantastic nutrition, the
patient still had gum disease.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the lecture, a
fellow by the name of Olympio

00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Pinto, who was a dentist
from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
he walked up to the podium
and he asked Dr. Huggins

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
if he would like to know
why those patients did not

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:90%
get better.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Dr.
Huggins said, sure.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to know why those
patients didn't get better.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:84%
He said to them, it's
because you did not remove

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:90%
their mercury fillings first.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So all the nutrition
in the world

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
was not going to heal
their gum disease.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
Olympio Pinto's father was one

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
of the first dentists in Brazil
to remove mercury fillings from

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
a small young girl-- probably
about nine, 10 years old--

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:90%
who had developed leukemia.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And he removed her fillings
in her leukemia disappeared.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he
was criticized.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
He went ahead and placed the
fillings back in her mouth

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and the leukemia came back.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the parents insisted

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:84%
on him taking the fillings
out for a second time.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So that was Olympio
Pinto's father.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And then came Olympio Pinto
who grew up understanding

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:90%
how toxic mercury was.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And then he came to Mexico
City and met Dr. Hal Huggins,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:90%
gave him the news.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hal Huggins came
back to Colorado Springs

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and he began looking
at his patients who

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:90%
had mercury fillings.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And he would actually
do a blood test on them,

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
remove the mercury
fillings, and then

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
do another blood test on them
afterwards and compare the two.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:84%
After he'd completed
about 20 patients

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and he saw the remarkable
improvement in their blood

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:84%
chemistry after their mercury
fillings were removed,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:90%
he got very excited about this.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:84%
He prepared all of his notes,
he went to the American Dental

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Association in
Chicago, and he thought

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
for sure they were going to
recommend the Nobel Prize.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
They would at least
pat him on the back

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and congratulate
him on letting them

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:90%
know how toxic amalgam was.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.295 align:middle line:84%
That's not exactly
what happened.

00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: That was before
he wrote the book, right?

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: That was before
he wrote the book.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:84%
They were not interested
in what he had to say.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So he decided to write the book
and take it to the lay people,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
take it to the public, let
them know what was going on.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what started
Amalgam War III.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
then something

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:90%
called the gag order was passed.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And that was a semi law.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Because there's laws that are
passed in courtrooms and that

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:90%
all of the lawyers know about.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
laws that are passed

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:34.090 align:middle line:84%
in professional societies that
are not necessarily quote laws.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So the gag law was passed
that said that if any dentist

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:90%
mentions the M word--

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and meaning mercury--
to their patients,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
they would have their license
revoked for unethical behavior.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: For something that's
actually killing the patient?

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: It's something that's
actually killing the patient.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So once that law was
passed, the dentists

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
couldn't even talk to
their patients about it.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well,
here's Dr. Hal Huggins

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
on his revolutionary
research into mercury.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:10%
>> What, in your opinion, is
causing so many health problems

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:10%
today?

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:10%
>>HAL HUGGINS (ON
VIDEO): My opinion?

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, from what I
see having worked

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:10%
in this field for about 44
of my 50 years in practice,

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:10%
the majority of what I see is
caused in the dental office.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:10%
The silver colored fillings are
really mercury silver colored.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:10%
So they're not really
silver fillings.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:10%
They are mercury fillings.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:10%
And mercury appears
to be a poison.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:10%
At least, everybody in science
thinks so except dentistry.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:10%
In fact, one of the interesting
quotations from dentistry

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:10%
is, yes, mercury is the most
hazardous metal on the planet.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:10%
However, in the mouth
it's toxic properties

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:10%
are rendered harmless.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:10%
I took a postdoctoral Master's
in Immunology and Toxicology

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:10%
for about four years.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:10%
And I mentioned that to
the professors there.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And they got a real good
laugh out of that and said,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:10%
somebody must have
discovered alchemy.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:10%
Because wherever you
put mercury, it kills.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:10%
I was asking one
of my professors

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:10%
in toxicology one time,
EPA has a safe level,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:10%
and OSHA has a safe
level, and dentistry

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:10%
has a very high safe level.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:10%
What is a safe level?

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:10%
And he looked at me--
this is in front of class,

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.080 align:middle line:10%
so I was quite
taken by his answer,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:10%
because he started well, Doctor.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:10%
I knew I was in trouble.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:10%
He said, one atom
can kill one cell.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:10%
You tell me the safe level.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.240 align:middle line:10%
There is no safe level.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:10%
But why does dentistry use it?

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:10%
Because it's cheap.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:10%
It's easy to place.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.747 align:middle line:10%
What more could you ask for?

00:13:57.747 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So when he
came out with his book,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
"It's All In Your Head",
exposing all this,

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
what was the response
in dentistry?

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Conventional dentistry
wanted to tar and feather him

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:90%
if they could.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:90%
No kidding.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So remind us all
again your first experience

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.702 align:middle line:84%
with mercury and how
you dealt with that.

00:14:16.702 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, my first
experience with mercury

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:90%
was at the age of four.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing that
that's what it was,

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I received my first
mercury filling as a child

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and then received
quite a few after that.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Though, at the
age of 19, I began

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:90%
working as a dental assistant.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.918 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, we
did not wear gloves.

00:14:33.918 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Not that it would have helped,
because the mercury goes

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:90%
through the glove.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:90%
We did not wear face masks.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And we actually mixed the
mercury with the powder,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
shook it up in a little
machine, and then

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:90%
squeezed it out with our hands.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
The excess mercury would
squeeze out of the cheesecloth

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and we would throw it
into a garbage can.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
If we missed the
garbage can and it

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:84%
landed on a rug similar
to this rug, so what?

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Nobody really knew that we were
handling the most toxic element

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know that.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So I started working
as a dental assistant.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And within a year of me
working as a dental assistant,

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:84%
my thyroid gland swelled up
to the size of a grapefruit.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Dentists had just placed 18
new fresh fillings in my mouth.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Now they call it a heavy metal.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
The reason they call it a heavy
metal is because it is heavy

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and it literally drops from
the mouth down into the body.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first organs that
mercury attacks is the thyroid.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes down
and further, attacks,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and goes into your lungs,
goes into your stomach,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:90%
messes up your digestive system.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.225 align:middle line:84%
And then, ultimately, in old
age, most of people's mercury,

00:15:46.225 --> 00:15:48.350 align:middle line:84%
if they still have mercury
fillings in their mouth,

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
they will have them in their
prostate gland and, for women,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
in their ovaries
and their uterus.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:90%
So it is a heavy metal.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
It does sink from here all
the way down to the bottom.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So at the age of 19, I started
working as a dental assistant.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
A year later, I had my
thyroid gland removed,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
because the medical doctor
saw it on Monday and said, OK,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.312 align:middle line:84%
we're taking your
thyroid gland out.

00:16:11.312 --> 00:16:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
after the operation,

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, so what did you find?

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Was it cancerous?

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to die?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
They said, no, it was a benign
tumor, but it was enlarged.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.003 align:middle line:84%
So you have no thyroid
now and we're just

00:16:22.003 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
going to give you
thyroid medicine

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what are the
repercussions of not having

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:90%
a thyroid gland?

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.728 align:middle line:84%
Well, you'll probably
have a heart attack

00:16:31.728 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:90%
by the time you're 50.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, I had no idea.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Nobody made the connection
between the mercury

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that I was handling on a
daily basis and the problems

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:90%
I was having.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Wow.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
What percentage
today of dentists

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:90%
use mercury in their fillings?

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: At least 50%.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
They did a survey
a few years ago

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and found out the number was
actually 54% of the dentists

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:90%
were using mercury still.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Why do
you think that is?

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Because it's cheap.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Because it's easy to use.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, what
most people don't

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:84%
realize is while
50% of the dentists

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:middle line:84%
are still putting mercury
fillings in people's mouths,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.540 align:middle line:84%
it's not across
the economic board.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to find
mercury fillings being placed

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.210 align:middle line:84%
in upper middle
class neighborhoods,

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
because those people don't want
something ugly in their mouth.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it is
being placed in the poorer

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:84%
neighborhoods where many
people are either on disability

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
or not making enough
money to actually make

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:84%
a choice to have
the slightly more

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.807 align:middle line:90%
expensive composite filling.

00:17:36.807 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say a word about
that, because while people say,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
well, composites
are more expensive,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:90%
but they're really not.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They may be more expensive
the day they're put in.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the life of
the filling and of the tooth,

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
actually, the mercury
amalgam filling

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:84%
is more expensive, because
it's going to crack later

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
mean another filling.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to crack again

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to mean
putting a crown on.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.187 align:middle line:84%
And then the tooth
is going to die

00:18:01.187 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to mean
needing a root canal.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to need a post.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going to need a
crown and on, and on, and on.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So actually, the amalgam
filling in the long run

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
is a much more
expensive filling than

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.835 align:middle line:90%
the simple composite filling.

00:18:15.835 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: When patients come
in and the dentists sit down

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
with them, the
dentists are explaining

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
to the patient about
the dangers of mercury

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and the different
options that they have?

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: No, I'm sorry.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't happen.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:90%
That really doesn't happen.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
The dentist does not
walk into the operatory--

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:84%
that's the room where
the work is done--

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
does not walk into the operatory
with a menu and does not--

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
very often, doesn't even
tell the patient what

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:90%
are you putting in the mouth.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
tell the patients.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:90%
So the patients don't know.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I've asked many people,
what's in your mouth?

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The dentist is God
in the dental office.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The dentist makes
all of the decisions.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how does
the mercury actually

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:90%
get released from the filling?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUBE: Well, mercury
is a volatile material,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:10%
which means that, at room
temperature, it is a liquid.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And it stays a liquid
until it's very, very cold.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So at room temperature,
it's a liquid.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And as we know in a
little bit of science,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
all liquids evaporate
at all times.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
If I was to put a droplet
of mercury or water,

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, on
your hand, eventually,

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:90%
it's going to evaporate.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the same
thing with mercury.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
When you mix mercury
with all these powders

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and you put it inside the
tooth, at 98.6 degrees, which

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
is body temperature,
that mercury

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:84%
is now evaporating
twice as fast as it

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
would if you had that drop of
mercury sitting on a table.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's constantly evaporating,
24 hours a day, seven days

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And the body is constantly
absorbing some of that mercury.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So we use a term
called cumulative,

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:90%
which means it's cumulative.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, more
mercury comes into the body

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:90%
than can be released.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:84%
The average human being
is capable of releasing

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:90%
30 micrograms--

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:90%
micro meaning very small--

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.580 align:middle line:84%
without getting too
technical here--

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:90%
micrograms means very small--

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
a microgram, this is
thousandth of a milligram--

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.590 align:middle line:90%
30 micrograms per day.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
average human being

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:90%
is capable of getting rid of.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've measured
some mercury fillings

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:84%
in people's mouths that
were emitting 30, 40, 50

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.448 align:middle line:90%
micrograms per 10 seconds.

00:20:34.448 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What about when
they eat certain foods, drink

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
hot liquids, anything like
that can increase the release?

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Absolutely.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
If you drink
something hot, you're

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
going to have more mercury
coming off your fillings.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
If you chew gum, you're going
to have more mercury coming off

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:90%
your fillings.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:84%
If you eat something
crunchy, crunchy granola--

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:84%
granola is a good
thing, isn't it?

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but if you eat
crunchy granola,

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
more mercury coming off

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:90%
your fillings.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And fish, unfortunately,
all fish have mercury.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Fish do not metabolize
mercury, which

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.800 align:middle line:84%
means whatever mercury they
take into their body, they keep.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ultimate ones
for holding on to mercury.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
The larger the fish,
the more little fish

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
that fish has
eaten in the ocean.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the larger the
fish, the more mercury it has.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So tuna, which is a very large
fish, loaded with mercury.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: We actually have
a video here of mercury

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:90%
being released from a filling.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.678 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:21:32.678 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:10%
>> The American Dental
Association has made

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:10%
the argument that mercury
is fixed in amalgam fillings

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't come out easily.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:10%
And what this research that
we're doing here visually shows

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:10%
is that when you drill
on an amalgam filling,

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:10%
it's even worse than
what they imagined.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: That is amazing.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
If everybody saw
that, I think they

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
would question their dentist
before they have mercury

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.965 align:middle line:90%
put in their mouth.

00:21:58.965 --> 00:21:59.765 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Exactly.

00:21:59.765 --> 00:22:02.400 align:middle line:84%
If you could see the smoke
coming out of your teeth,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle line:84%
you would ask a question,
why is this happening to me?

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But the only reason you
could see it in this film

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
was because they had a
black light behind it

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:84%
when the black light was
produced by a mercury tube.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you could
see the mercury coming off.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:84%
If you could see it
coming off your teeth,

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:90%
you would question it.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:84%
If you could taste it,
you would question it.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:84%
If you could smell it,
you would question it.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But mercury doesn't do
any of those things.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:90%
You can't taste it.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:90%
You can't smell it.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But it is, in fact,
coming off the teeth

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
like that 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, all of the time.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Now what we saw
as an evaporation,

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.900 align:middle line:84%
the half life for mercury
in the body is 97 years.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we put mercury
fillings in your mouth,

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take 97 years
for half of that mercury

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.120 align:middle line:90%
to evaporate.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And then perhaps at that
point, the rest of the filling

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:90%
would crumble.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the dentist
would do what?

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Place a new mercury filling.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.838 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Put
another one in there.

00:23:02.838 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of why the
gas that's coming off it

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:84%
doesn't actually
weaken the filling

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:84%
or does it crack or
does it come out?

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.658 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: It's not enough
to weaken the filling.

00:23:11.658 --> 00:23:14.527 align:middle line:84%
But it's certainly
plenty to hurt the body.

00:23:14.527 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And you said earlier,
a tiny amount of mercury

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.790 align:middle line:90%
can damage the body.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Absolutely.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Every atom of mercury
will kill a cell.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, then it goes
on to kill another cell.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So any mercury that
we absorb in our body,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.545 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, we
keep for a long time.

00:23:30.545 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Let's
take another look

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
at the documentary
"Evidence of Harm"

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.480 align:middle line:84%
where experts discuss
just how little

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.983 align:middle line:90%
mercury it takes to do damage.

00:23:38.983 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE CASTEEL: When
a woman is pregnant,

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:10%
we hope that she's never
exposed to mercury vapors,

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:10%
because we know that it
can pass the placenta

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:10%
and cause neurological
problems in the unborn baby.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.580 align:middle line:10%
And if we see
residences or buildings

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:10%
that have 10 micrograms per
cubic meter or more of mercury,

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.390 align:middle line:10%
than we consider that
it poses a health risk.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:10%
And we recommend
that people don't

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:10%
stay in the building
or the residence.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:10%
>> 10 micrograms is generally
considered inhabitable without

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:08.917 align:middle line:10%
some kind of
respiratory protection.

00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Two schools will be closed
tomorrow after a custodian

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:10%
finds a small amount of
mercury on the floor of a room

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:10%
at Hickman Mills High School.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.008 align:middle line:10%
>> How much mercury
are we talking about?

00:24:17.008 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:10%
Not very much.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:10%
About the amount the size of
the eraser on this pencil.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:10%
But school officials
explained to us,

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:10%
it would only take
the amount of mercury

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:10%
about the size of the
sharpened end of this pencil

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.747 align:middle line:10%
to contaminate the
entire building.

00:24:29.747 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN COLE: They'll
evacuate a public building

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:10%
for a broken thermometer.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.020 align:middle line:10%
But each one of your
amalgam fillings

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:10%
contains roughly the
same amount of mercury.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So once the
mercury is released

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:84%
in the body, what are some of
the things someone can notice?

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:90%
What are the organs it affects?

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.743 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
diseases it may cause?

00:24:48.743 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the things you've

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.277 align:middle line:90%
noticed over the last 50 years?

00:24:52.277 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, that's a
very interesting question,

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
because it affects
all of the organs.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It affects every
cell in the body.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
The moment mercury
enters into the body,

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:84%
it immediately attacks
a protein molecule,

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:84%
because every protein
molecule has a configuration

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:90%
kind of shaped like a ball.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:84%
But someplace in that ball
is the sulfur molecule.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And mercury loves that sulfur
molecule, so it detects that.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The moment it does that, it's
now changed that protein.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So why would I
single out protein?

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:90%
We've got carbohydrates.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:90%
We've got fats.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:90%
We've got proteins.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Why do I single out proteins?

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, because every
reaction in the body--

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and we have something like 3
trillion reactions per second--

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
every reaction in the
body requires an enzyme.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
A plus B goes to C. In
the body, doesn't happen

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:90%
unless there's an enzyme there.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And so well, what's
the big deal?

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, the big deal is that all
of our enzymes are proteins.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part
that mercury attacks.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So it slows down all of
the reactions in the body.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.593 align:middle line:84%
So then you add-- that question
was kind of double-sided.

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:84%
The other part of that question
was, what kind of symptoms

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:90%
do you see?

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the first symptoms
you see from mercury toxicity

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:90%
is irritability.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:90%
It changes your mood.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.880 align:middle line:90%
It changes the way you think.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're suffering
from irritability.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:84%
You might fly off the
handle for no reason.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Somebody will ask you,
how are you doing today?

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And you might say, why
are you asking me that?

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:90%
That's not a normal response.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So irritability is one of
the first things we see.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.670 align:middle line:90%
We see depression.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:90%
We see anxiety.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So mostly, the psychological
aspects of mercury toxicity.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, the next
most popular thing you see

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:84%
is it attacks, like I
said, the thyroid gland.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we have chronic fatigue
is probably the largest symptom

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.260 align:middle line:90%
that our patients have.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
They come into see us
with chronic fatigue,

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.300 align:middle line:84%
because their thyroid is
not functioning normally,

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:90%
not at all.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got stomach
problems, because the mercury

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:57.890 align:middle line:90%
is swallowed.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They say we swallow
2,500 times a day.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of swallowing.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Every time we swallow,
mercury goes into the stomach,

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
kills off the good
bacteria, the ones

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:84%
that help us
produce more enzymes

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:90%
so we can digest our food.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Kills off the good
bacteria and then

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
allows the
spirochaets, the yeast,

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.510 align:middle line:90%
the fungi to proliferate.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So I jokingly, but
quite seriously, say,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:84%
show me somebody with an
amalgam filling in their mouth.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you somebody who
has way too many parasites,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.490 align:middle line:90%
has a yeast problem.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Show me something with an
amalgam filling in their mouth

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show you somebody
who has allergies,

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.840 align:middle line:84%
because they're not digesting
their food properly.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.420 align:middle line:84%
The food gets absorbed
through the stomach,

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
through the small intestines,
through the large intestines

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.310 align:middle line:90%
undigested.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
when undigested food

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:90%
enters into the bloodstream?

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The body looks at
that and says, this

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.090 align:middle line:90%
is not something we can use.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be bad.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.232 align:middle line:90%
Let's attack it.

00:27:57.232 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And so now we've
got the beginnings

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:90%
of allergies forming.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of my other symptoms I
had as a dental assistant was I

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
would break out in hives
from the top of my head

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:90%
down to my toes.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, nobody could figure
out what I was allergic to.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Went to Mount Sinai
Hospital in New York,

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.355 align:middle line:84%
had a series of
allergy tests done.

00:28:14.355 --> 00:28:15.730 align:middle line:84%
In those days,
they actually used

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:84%
to poke your back with
a thousand little holes.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And each hole had an
allergen attached to it.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So you had a grid about
this big on your back.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Came back the next day
after they poked me

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.312 align:middle line:84%
with all these holes
and they said, wow,

00:28:29.312 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how
to tell you this,

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.050 align:middle line:84%
but you're allergic
to everything.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Huggins would call that an
EI, Environmentally Ill person.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.580 align:middle line:90%
They're allergic to everything.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the patient
who has to put a cotton

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
sheet on the dental chair
so that they can sit down,

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
because they're allergic to the
plastics in the dental chair.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the person who has to
carry their own water around

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.470 align:middle line:84%
They're limited to three,
perhaps four different foods

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.790 align:middle line:90%
that they can eat.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
allergies reached

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:07.860 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate climax in severity
is when you become an EI.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
happen overnight.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the accumulation
of mercury in the body.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So once mercury has affected
how you think, affected

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:84%
how you metabolize food,
affected how you digest food,

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:90%
the only thing left is hormones.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are a
lot of hormones.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Not just hormones that
make you want to have sex.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:84%
We have hormones that make
us want to go to sleep.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.010 align:middle line:90%
We have hormones that drive us.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.010 align:middle line:84%
We have hormones for
everything in our body,

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:90%
that digest your food.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are also
made of proteins.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And so mercury attacks hormones
by attacking the protein

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that our body uses to
make these hormones.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How many people
do you think right now

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.940 align:middle line:84%
over the age of
40, let's say, have

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:84%
amalgams in their mouth
in the United States?

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I would venture
to say, over the age of 40,

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:06.020 align:middle line:84%
probably 70% have
amalgams in their mouth.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And no one has
told them that they

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
have a toxic material
in their mouth

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that could be contributing to
whatever ailments they have.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
many times, you

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
don't know what ailment
do you have that

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.380 align:middle line:84%
is being directly
caused by your fillings.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't know that until the
fillings are removed properly.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Once the fillings
are removed properly,

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.475 align:middle line:84%
if the ailment goes away,
well, then it's a given.

00:30:30.475 --> 00:30:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And how
many people are

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.030 align:middle line:84%
put on antidepressants,
anti-anxiety medications, which

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
contain fluoride, and
more toxins that they're

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:90%
putting into their system?

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.840 align:middle line:90%
What about autoimmune?

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I know you've had
done some research

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.585 align:middle line:90%
with autoimmune disorders.

00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.793 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, here again,
when the mercury enters

00:30:47.793 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:84%
into the body and it attaches
itself to one of our cells,

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
suppose I have a nerve
cell and now the mercury

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
has come and attached
itself to the nerve cell,

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:02.042 align:middle line:84%
the body looks at
that and it knows.

00:31:02.042 --> 00:31:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me talk about
my own body here,

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
because I can be very
opinionated about that.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:12.620 align:middle line:84%
My body knows that every cell
has the letters B-L-A-N-C-H-E,

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Blanche.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And when my immune cells
see that, ah, Blanche,

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:90%
that's a good cell.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:90%
We're going to leave that alone.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.397 align:middle line:84%
Ah, Blanche, that's
a good cell too.

00:31:22.397 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:90%
We're going to leave that alone.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a sudden it
sees a cell that is spelled

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:35.280 align:middle line:84%
B-L-A-N-H-G-C-H-E. That's
no longer a Blanche cell.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.310 align:middle line:84%
That's a Blanche cell with
mercury attached to it.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:84%
The body recognizes
it as non-self,

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and then begins to
attack non-self,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and then goes crazy
attacking non-self.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:51.040 align:middle line:84%
That is the beginning
of autoimmune disease.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How common is it for
you to see those conditions

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:90%
in your practice?

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Very common.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Very common.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I would say, 70% of my
practice is chronic fatigue.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Another 10% to 20% is
autoimmune disease.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And probably the last
10% are cancer patients.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And the autoimmune
patients, they most likely

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.600 align:middle line:84%
are being seen by
general practitioners,

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:84%
or endocrinologists,
or something like that.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.430 align:middle line:84%
But they're put
on corticosteroids

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:90%
to suppress the symptoms.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
They're put on
antibiotics to help

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.150 align:middle line:84%
them digest better, which
it does just the opposite,

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:90%
helps them digest worse.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:30.190 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult once
the body has educated

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:84%
itself to kill itself,
it's very difficult

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.775 align:middle line:90%
to reeducate the body.

00:32:35.775 --> 00:32:37.900 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most
difficult things to get rid of

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.090 align:middle line:84%
is autoimmune disease
and allergies.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Very difficult.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how
did their symptoms

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:48.190 align:middle line:84%
resolve after you've taken
the mercury fillings out?

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: It depends
on this symptom.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Some patients, especially the--

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I love chronic fatigue
patients, because they're

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:58.030 align:middle line:84%
the ones, the next day,
they're just feeling fantastic.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%
As a matter, of
fact, the woman who

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.993 align:middle line:84%
brought me that original
article on mercury toxicity--

00:33:03.993 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:84%
she was my patient,
she brought me

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
the article on
mercury toxicity--

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.030 align:middle line:90%
she had chronic fatigue.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I was her dentist
and I was putting

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:84%
in more mercury fillings
every time she came to see me.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:84%
My husband was treating
her chiropractically

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:84%
trying to make her
healthier so that you could

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:90%
handle the chronic fatigue.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Then she would come
back to me and I

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.868 align:middle line:90%
would put in more chronic--

00:33:24.868 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I would put in more
mercury fillings.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So do you see this triangle
that was going on here?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I found out how
toxic mercury fillings were,

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:84%
she was my first patient,
I called her up and I said,

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for opening my eyes.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that I had
chronic meyloblastic leukemia.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.700 align:middle line:90%
I had my fillings removed.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I had my five root
canal teeth taken away.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
My brain fog
disappeared overnight.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.860 align:middle line:84%
My leukemia disappeared
in three weeks.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank
you and I'm going

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.160 align:middle line:90%
to remove all of your fillings.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Now done the right way,
following the Huggins protocol,

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to remove all
your fillings for free.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:10%
This woman could
either go food shopping

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.620 align:middle line:10%
or do a load of laundry.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.630 align:middle line:90%
She could not do both.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.300 align:middle line:84%
That's how severe her
chronic fatigue was.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:84%
One year after we had removed
all of her fillings properly,

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:22.159 align:middle line:84%
she was on the ski slope at
Elk Mountain in Pennsylvania.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.889 align:middle line:84%
And she said she had just
gotten off the chairlift.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:29.659 align:middle line:84%
She was just about to swoosh
down when she said to herself,

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:34.590 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I couldn't
do this a year ago.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:36.210 align:middle line:90%
She was skiing.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.949 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I have
one more question.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:41.850 align:middle line:84%
If mercury is so toxic,
why do they allow--

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.190 align:middle line:84%
what do you do when you throw
it out inside the office?

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:84%
If you take a mercury
filling out, isn't there

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.620 align:middle line:84%
OSHA regulations and
say that you can not

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:54.120 align:middle line:84%
be in an environment, in a
work environment, with mercury?

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:84%
How are they disposing of
this and OSHA's not closing

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.547 align:middle line:90%
all these dental offices down?

00:34:58.547 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That's a good question.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Our office in Pennsylvania
was the first office

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:09.180 align:middle line:84%
in Pennsylvania to install a
mercury amalgam separator so

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that when the water that
came from our dental units

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:84%
went down into the basement,
the amalgam got separated.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we were one of
the first to do that.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was 28 years
ago we separated amalgam.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.170 align:middle line:84%
The government has
now passed a law

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:84%
saying that all
dental offices have

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:90%
to have an amalgam separator.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.570 align:middle line:84%
All dental offices have to
have an amalgam separator.

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them do yet,
but they're supposed to.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So prior to the
amalgam separator,

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.260 align:middle line:84%
if a dentist had scrap amalgam,
he would have to put it--

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
or she-- would have to put
it in a jar, a glass jar,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.400 align:middle line:84%
put it underwater, and
make sure that the glass

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:90%
jar had a sealed lid on top.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there
were organizations

00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:00.220 align:middle line:84%
that would come to the
office and actually collect

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.050 align:middle line:90%
that amalgam.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.050 align:middle line:10%
They would take it to
some mining company,

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:08.110 align:middle line:10%
and they would process
it, and refurbish it,

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.550 align:middle line:10%
and use it all over again.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And they would get a few
pennies to the dollar

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:84%
for the amount of
scrap gold and they

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.880 align:middle line:84%
would use it to do
some good deed with it.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.550 align:middle line:90%
But it really is blood money.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:90%
It really is blood money.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So prior to that,
we were supposed

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.230 align:middle line:90%
to put it in a glass jar.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a very toxic material.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:10%
So think about it, if
we put it in your mouth,

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.310 align:middle line:10%
well, if we're going
to follow OSHA rules,

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:10%
we should have it underwater.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.970 align:middle line:10%
So put a lot of
water in your mouth.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It should be in
glass, so we're going

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to have to put a glass
bubble over your head.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have to seal it too.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So after a few
minutes, you won't

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:90%
be able to breathe too well.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Is that bizarre?

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: It's totally bizarre.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.838 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: What a list of
contradictions in this country.

00:36:49.838 --> 00:36:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Thank you so
much for sharing all

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.785 align:middle line:90%
this incredible information.

00:36:52.785 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: You're very welcome.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.083 align:middle line:90%
This was a pleasure.

00:36:54.083 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.610 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD: In the
next episode, we'll

00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:00.000 align:middle line:10%
learn more about what mercury
can do when left in the body

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:10%
and how to safely remove it.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Edward Group.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Healing Matrix".
