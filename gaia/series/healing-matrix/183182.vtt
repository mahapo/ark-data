00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE MORLER: Almost
everyone knows

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:84%
someone who is impacted
by depression, anxiety,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:90%
or addiction.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:10%
And so often, those
struggling are

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:10%
prescribed medications, or
just tell to get over it,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:10%
and that their mental health
and self-control is just

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:10%
mind over matter.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Today, we will learn
that that is not really

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
so simple to do if we
do not balance our brain

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:90%
chemistry first.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
With us is Dr. Hyla
Cass, an acclaimed expert

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
in integrative
medicine and psychiatry

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
who helps individuals
reclaim their brain.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Welcome Dr. Cass.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HYLA CASS:
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit
about your background,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.105 align:middle line:84%
your childhood, your early
influences in this arena.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Get on my couch and
tell me about your childhood.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Tell me about your world.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It all started when?

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.867 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: It all
started in Toronto.

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:90%
I was born in Toronto.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:90%
And my dad was a physician.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And he had his
office in our home.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And that was my first exposure.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:10%
So here I was, a little
girl maybe three years old,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:10%
four years old, answering
the door for the patients,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:10%
sitting with them
in the waiting room.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:10%
The whole basement was--
a lovely finished basement

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:10%
in the house, because this was
in Toronto, we had basements.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:10%
And I'd see them come in
kind of upset, worried,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:10%
and come out
feeling much better.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Looking much better.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, my father
would actually talk to me

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
about different cases.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Not saying well that
person had this or that.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It was not like that, but
just in general talking

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
about medicine and
how he was working.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't have a
lot of medications.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
It was him, his bedside
manner, the relationship

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
he had with the patient
and their families.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And what he did apply, he
applied very skillfully.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.950 align:middle line:90%
And that was all my role model.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I get it.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I was raised by
a doctor as well.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So I understand that whole
observation of what happens.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And so for you, what
did you take away

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
from that experience
of witnessing

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
him managing patients
in such a fashion that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:90%
shows up in your world now?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.937 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: First of
all, I thought it

00:02:27.937 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
was a very powerful profession
to have that kind of influence

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:90%
on people.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I want to do that.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.227 align:middle line:90%
I want to be like daddy.

00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Actually, at one point, it
was like I want to be a nurse

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
and help daddy.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And then, no, I want to do it.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And he encouraged me.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
He was really my mentor, and
always said, go to med school.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
He even took me to
Women's College Hospital

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and all women's hospital
that-- and introduced me

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:90%
to his women colleagues.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, see, they have
families, they have children,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and they have a practice, and
they work at the hospital.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:90%
You can do it too.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:90%
And that was what I needed.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.243 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Sounds like a lovely
influence in your life.

00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Very, special.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And very blessed to have
that kind of guidance early on.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So you moved into what is now
called integrative medicine,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
which I feel is kind of a
reflection of the medicine

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:90%
of the good old days.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But tell us what your idea
of integrative medicine is?

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:90%
What is it to you?

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.768 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well,
integrative medicine,

00:03:27.768 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
which has actually morphed
into functional medicine,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
it really depends on
where you're coming from.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it's working
with the body's chemistry

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and physiology.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call
good medicine.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It should not be a
separate branch at all.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But particularly, like
my field of psychiatry,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
so many people have
medical issues,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're being treated
with psychotropic medications

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
without anyone looking at
the rest of their physiology

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:90%
or biochemistry.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that just
doesn't make any sense.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The whole person
has become left out.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%
So who is it that comes to you?

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:90%
What are they asking for?

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.407 align:middle line:84%
What is that happens
inside your doors?

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, I'm board
certified in psych--

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I went to medical
school, University

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:90%
of Toronto School of Medicine.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I did a rotating
internship, where

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
actually did surgery
and delivered babies,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
so I was really well
versed in all of medicine.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:84%
Then, I did a psych residency,
and then a fellowship

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:90%
in child and family psychiatry.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So I have all of that
in my background.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
come to me, they're

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
coming to me for
psychiatric issues,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:84%
for anxiety, depression,
bipolar illness, addiction.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
But what they're looking for is
a different kind of treatment,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
because they've been through the
routine conventional treatment

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't worked for them.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So your approach from a
psychiatrist's perspective

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:84%
is different than the
average psychiatrist.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
How-- what can
you share with us?

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, I
start off by taking

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
really good medical history,
dietary history, illnesses,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:84%
symptoms, what
medications they've taken,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:84%
family history, and
so on, and determine

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:84%
what's likely to be
the issue, and actually

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:90%
begin treating right then.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And also, we'll most
often order lab tests.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Sort of, it's like looking
under the hood of the car.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Conventional medicine is
looking at the dashboard,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
it's the analogy of
the dashboard on a car,

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:90%
the red light goes on.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So conventional medicine
puts a Band-Aid over it.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, we'll just
cover over the red light.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Take the fuse out.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Pull out the wire,
and see, no more red light.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not-- so the
symptoms are actually a signal,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:84%
just like the red light is a
signal to there's something

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:90%
wrong under there.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Sure.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: So I take these symptoms
as, well, what's going on?

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
If there's anxiety,
depression, bipolar illness,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever, what's
going on underneath?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I my
detective work comes in.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Something's
causing these symptoms.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at the
whole person, which

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely necessary
if we're ever really going

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.597 align:middle line:84%
to be creating wholeness for
our patients and colleagues.

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: By the way, this isn't
to negate psychological issues.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
People have things
that happen to them.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:90%
They have traumas.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
traumas can really

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
influence how your physiology
and biochemistry work,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and make you more
prone to illness.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
There was the ACES study,
Adverse Childhood Experience

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Study, that really
proved this, that people

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:84%
who have had early
childhood trauma

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:84%
grow up to be much
more susceptible

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:90%
to a great number of illnesses.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So we do have to pay
attention to the psychology.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm-hmm.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: But it's easier to
work with the psychology

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.333 align:middle line:84%
and do therapy, once the brain
is working on all cylinders.

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And I definitely
want to get into that.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited
about the conversation

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to get into today.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But before we go
further, I'd like

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
to just ask you, what was
it that you were seeing

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that traditional medicine was
doing to treat mental health

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
conditions that you didn't
like, that kind of inspired you

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.785 align:middle line:90%
into what you're doing now?

00:07:02.785 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, people
were automatically

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:90%
just put on medication.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:84%
You have a symptom, you
get this medication,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and no attention was
being paid to what

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:90%
this symptom was due to.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And the symptom
is just a signal,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:84%
it's a message from
the body saying

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:90%
something's out of whack.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:90%
We need to fix that.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I'm actually
looking under the hood.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing lab tests.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting historical
information.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping to figure
out what the source is

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:90%
of that particular issue.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, anxiety
can be due to--

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:84%
it could be a
psychological reason.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be due to say
thyroiditis, low blood sugar.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on and on,
the many reasons

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that a physiologically you
could have anxiety, so let's go

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:90%
to the root cause.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Instead of
treating just the symptom.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And then these meds have
really major side effects.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.047 align:middle line:84%
They can actually-- they
can cause more anxiety.

00:07:58.047 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:90%
They can cause depression.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
They can cause
other brain changes.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
SSRIs have been

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
shown to cause suicidal
thinking in people who

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:90%
had never been suicidal before.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the drug itself

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
that causes what's
called akathisia,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:90%
which is a kind of a jumpiness.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And people would change,
and horrible things happen.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:90%
People commit suicide.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:90%
They commit homicide.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:84%
They kill family members
in this kind of stupor.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, of course,
they're just in bereft.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It's horrible, and I
know cases like that.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And they're
considered side effects.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:84%
To me, those are
the direct effects.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
This not a side effect, this
is an effect of taking this,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and can certainly lead
to life out of control.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think humanity is
waking up to this, definitely.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.895 align:middle line:84%
And it's so beautiful
that you're here

00:08:52.895 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:84%
bridging these
worlds for people,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and allowing this to become
an easier path for people

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.270 align:middle line:90%
to discover.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask you,
when did you first

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
start noticing that these
psychiatric medications were

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.052 align:middle line:84%
causing as much of a problem as
they were offering a solution?

00:09:10.052 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, when I
was in my residency,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have as many drugs.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And even then, they
all had side effects.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering,
this is not--

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:90%
this is not a good solution.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was well-trained
in psychotherapy

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
as well, which was great,
psychodynamic, psychotherapy,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:90%
even psychoanalysis.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
like using medications.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to just train
in different ways and following

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
different people that I thought
had some answers, like Abraham

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Hoffer, who was one of the
fathers of orthomolecular

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:84%
psychiatry, which is
kind of what I practice,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:84%
which is talking about
how to fix the molecular--

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.803 align:middle line:84%
fixed things at a
molecular level.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That is
creating chemistry.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:84%
That is giving a response,
and then the person

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
is living inside of
these effects, et cetera.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So beautifully that you're
trying to approach it

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.270 align:middle line:84%
from every angle to get to
this whole person, which

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is definitely, definitely
the message of today.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, something
really interesting

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
too is that people tend
to blame the patient.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:90%
They're resistant.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
They've have a
resistant depression.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.453 align:middle line:84%
Or they don't want
to get better.

00:10:18.453 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Or if we just find
the right drug.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Are there
benefits from being sick?

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Are they--

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.143 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Right, or getting the
right combination of meds,

00:10:25.143 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and you take one medication.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, well,
that's not working.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:90%
You increase it.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:90%
You add another one, and you--

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and they end up on a
cocktail of medication

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:84%
being really like
zombies from it,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and still-- they're
still not better.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Sometimes people are
taking so many medications

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that they don't know the effects
that they have on each other,

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and there's really no
way to research that.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:84%
It simply is impossible for
us to know all of the effects,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and all of the counter-effects
that these medications

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:90%
are having.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:90%
So we're in this dilemma.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But let me ask, are
there some situations

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:84%
where someone does need to be on
a medication, in your opinion?

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: I suppose so.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.352 align:middle line:84%
In an acute situation,
if somebody is violently

00:11:09.352 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
acting out, you want to give
them a shot of something

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:90%
that'll bring them down.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.162 align:middle line:84%
And they're probably
acupressure points you can use.

00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are things
you can-- there's so

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:84%
many things you can
do energetically.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:90%
There are herbal formulas.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.785 align:middle line:84%
But in a pinch, they're going
to go to an emergency room,

00:11:23.785 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
get a shot of something.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of how it is.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
we have a lot of evidence

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that the natural products that
work with the body's chemistry

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.583 align:middle line:90%
are actually more effective.

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, well, how
can a natural product

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:90%
be as strong as a drug?

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.385 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a fallacy, because
the drugs are too strong,

00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing
a lot of things

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.198 align:middle line:84%
that they shouldn't
be doing, that you

00:11:48.198 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:90%
don't want them to be do.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.382 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: .

00:11:49.382 --> 00:11:50.182 align:middle line:90%
Overpowering

00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Yeah, and then when you
work with the body's chemistry,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:84%
you're doing what you need
to do to restore balance.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, absolutely.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I was raised without
any medications.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've never gone to the
doctor and had a prescription.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Never taken an antibiotic.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So I totally get
what you're saying,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and know that this is a
reality, that humanity needs

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:84%
to empower themselves,
and into deeper degrees

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:90%
than we have in our culture.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.813 align:middle line:84%
Now you talk about other
things, foods that people eat,

00:12:17.813 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:90%
these types of things.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak about that?

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Foods that we eat, and--

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Oh my heavens, yes.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The impact that it
can have on our brains,

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.342 align:middle line:84%
on our memory, on our
energy levels, et cetera.

00:12:29.342 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Where is that in the picture.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: The prevailing
American diet is really

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:90%
a disaster in every way.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: It's addictive.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:90%
There's preservatives.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:84%
There's chemicals we were
never meant to ingest.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:90%
There's glyphosate.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:84%
You know that Monsanto was
sued and people won cases

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
for getting cancer from
glyphosate from roundup.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a Monsanto product.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the tide is turning.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping so.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But these chemicals with
people eating pure chemicals,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:90%
children eating chemicals.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: I mean it's horrifying.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Food isn't food anymore.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: It's Franken food.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And unless we take some
real serious care to make sure

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that we are ingesting foods that
our bodies recognize as food,

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:84%
so that the body's systems
don't get out of balance trying

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.235 align:middle line:84%
to compensate for the profits
that are coming from--

00:13:29.235 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Well, there you go.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the profit
motive where foods

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
have built in addictiveness,
so you can't just eat one.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:90%
You just keep eating them.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And the obesity
rate is horrible.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:90%
It's just gone up exponentially.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:84%
We have childhood
type 2 diabetes.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:90%
We never had that.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.903 align:middle line:84%
When I went to medical
school, it was adult onset.

00:13:50.903 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
The health of the
public has really

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:84%
gone down, except for the
whole other group of people

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:90%
who are eating organically.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
We're eating
consciously, and it's

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
like there's two
different populations.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, and we have
to bridge those worlds.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:84%
We have to educate
people, because we've

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:84%
been kind of trained
into thinking

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:90%
that it's just the way it is.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It's an epidemic,
and people are sick,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and they need to take more
of this, that, or the other

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:90%
to turn things around.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's dive in to you.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Brain chemistry.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit about what all of that

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the brain
chemistry, and the influence

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:84%
that it has in our
ability to heal.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, the brain
is control central.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So when our brains
working well, we

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
have a really good chance of
everything else working well.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And buried in our brain is
also the pituitary gland,

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
which regulates
hormones, which act

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
on all the organs in the body
and back on the brain, as well.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
There are the neurotransmitters
that are made in the brain.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And also in the gut.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact 95% of our
neurotransmitters

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
our brain chemicals,
our chemical messengers

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:90%
are made in the gut.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
This is something
people don't realize.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: The gut's
like the second brain.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: So many people
with brain issues

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
actually have gut issues
that have to be addressed.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So if I weren't doing that as
a psychiatrist, I'd be remiss.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'm dealing with
neurotransmitters

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
on that level, on
the brain level,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also looking
at the gut, which

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
is also affecting the
neurotransmitters, which

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.080 align:middle line:90%
affect the brain.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: If we're not
metabolizing properly,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
those nutrients aren't
available to process and create

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:90%
these neurotransmitters.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.595 align:middle line:84%
So for our audience,
can you just

00:15:27.595 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:84%
say a little bit-- let's
back up a little bit

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and just say, OK, what's
a neurotransmitter?

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.387 align:middle line:90%
Just track us on that.

00:15:34.387 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Neurotransmitters
are chemical messengers.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:90%
They're made by specific cells.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:90%
There's serotonin, for example.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
There's dopamine, Gaba,
acetylcholine, endorphins,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
those are the most
studied ones, let's say.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin we know about from the
SSRIs, serotonin and selective

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
research on reuptake
inhibitor medications.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So serotonin is a
neurotransmitter

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that's coming that
curbs your appetite,

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:84%
that helps you feel good,
helps you to sleep at night.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And many people are
really low in serotonin.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:90%
This could be due to gut issues.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Can be due to stress.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So there's so many
issues, and you could also

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.377 align:middle line:84%
be low in serotonin
because you're

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
low in the B vitamins,
which also involves the gut.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So you're not
making serotonin, so

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:84%
what happens is you're anxious,
depressed, can't sleep,

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and binge eating, just because
you're low in serotonin.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can increase the
serotonin by giving precursor.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
And what's the precursor?

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like what it's made out of.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.995 align:middle line:84%
And it's made out
of things like-- we

00:16:41.995 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
could give tryptophan,
or 5-hydroxytryptophan,

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
together with some vitamins,
which are co-factors.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And that will
encourage the brain

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
to make the serotonin
that you need,

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
which also converts
to melatonin,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:90%
which helps you to sleep.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So are there
specific foods,

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
because I know people are
going to want to know?

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I get that,
and what can I do?

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:84%
What can I do to
begin that process?

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
Are there certain foods that
have a specific effect on what

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:10.553 align:middle line:90%
you're speaking about.

00:17:10.553 --> 00:17:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: For example, we were
just talking about serotonin.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.012 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk about dopamine
or the others, which

00:17:15.012 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:90%
we can get into.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is-- we'll take
one example right through.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
about serotonin,

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.819 align:middle line:84%
it's made from proteins,
from amino acids.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But it also requires
a little bit of carb

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to get across the
blood brain barrier.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So you want to have a little
bit of carb in your diet,

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
but the carbon your diet
should not be simple carbs.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:90%
What are simple carbs?

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Simple carbs are what
everybody scarfing up,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.757 align:middle line:84%
sugar, white flour,
all the white stuff.

00:17:42.757 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: All the good stuff.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:84%
All the stuff people
reach for in the moment.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: And it's
made to be addictive.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.512 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Versus the complex carb.

00:17:49.512 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Give us an eample.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Complex
Carbs, whole grains,

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:90%
for example, starchy vegetables.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:90%
So you get this--

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
you get a carbohydrate
that's not

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
going to make your blood
sugar go up and down, which

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:90%
the simple sugars do.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we want something
that's a slower release, that's

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
more consistent, so that
person doesn't roller coaster

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
with these highs
and these crashes.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Right.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're going up and down.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
down-- when you eat--

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
let's say you're feeling
I got to eat something,

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.600 align:middle line:84%
so you grab it and
you eat a donut.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So your blood sugar
spikes, and your pancreas

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
releases insulin
to take it down,

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:90%
because that's what it does.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it takes it
down out of the blood

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and stores it in your cells.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is it can overstep,

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and then you're feeling
kind of a shocking,

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:90%
oh, my blood sugar is low again.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:84%
When you have low blood sugar,
the message that the brain gets

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:90%
is this is bad.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.822 align:middle line:90%
This is dangerous.

00:18:52.822 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:90%
I have low blood sugar.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
You reach for another
donut or some other--

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Equally valuable things.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Something
along those lines.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes, something equally evil.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: So it's bad.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
This perpetuates itself until,
at some point, the cells say,

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:90%
we can't take in anymore.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:84%
We're not taking
in anymore sugar.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So the sugar is hanging
out in the bloodstream,

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.940 align:middle line:90%
the insulin is hanging out.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
The higher the insulin
gets, the sicker

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.970 align:middle line:90%
you get, and the fatter you get.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:90%
And then you develop diabetes.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So, like, diabetes is not just--
it's not an insulin deficiency.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a dietary issue.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And people who then--

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
frank diabetics
on insulin, going

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.570 align:middle line:84%
on organic diet, balanced,
with the right carbohydrates,

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
proteins, and fats, can
actually reverse their diabetes

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:90%
in most cases.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's not that
the insulin isn't there.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It's that the cells can't
take it in, because--

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: They can't use it.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --dynamic
isn't available,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
isn't present for that
process to be happening.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
relationship between this

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and supplementation--
foods, this balancing,

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:90%
and supplementation.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Just, speak about supplements.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Supplements,
we need to supplement.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, we should be
eating organically.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And people might say, it's
so expensive, I don't know.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But you can look up on
Environmental Working Group,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:84%
ewg.org, to see the "Dirty
Dozen" and the "Clean Fifteen,"

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.993 align:middle line:84%
which means there are a
dozen foods you absolutely--

00:20:26.993 --> 00:20:29.660 align:middle line:84%
fruits and vegetables-- that you
absolutely have to get organic,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.743 align:middle line:90%
and others that you don't.

00:20:30.743 --> 00:20:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Like, avocados not so bad,
you can go non-organic.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Strawberries must be
organic, because they

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:90%
are the most heavily sprayed.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And all these pesticides,
all these chemicals,

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:90%
are wreaking havoc in our body.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: So first of all, so
you're eating organically,

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:90%
so you don't have the toxins.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
But you also may not be
getting enough of the nutrients

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do all
the processes in your body.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Professor Roger
Williams many years ago

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:84%
talked about biochemical
individuality.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And we don't all need
the exact same number,

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:84%
amount of the certain
micronutrients--

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the B vitamins, vitamin
A, vitamin D, and so on.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It demands on your own
genetics, your stress level,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.830 align:middle line:84%
your history, your diet, the
many things that go into it.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's biochemical
individuality.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is
I test and I see

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.455 align:middle line:84%
what the levels are of
these different vitamins,

00:21:26.455 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
minerals, amino
acids, and so on.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:90%
And I treat accordingly.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it has
to be individualized.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And in that testing
process, what do you do?

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, I'll do different
blood tests, urine tests.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:84%
There's some that will measure
actual vitamin, mineral,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:90%
and amino acid levels.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a test that will
test for heavy metals.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you have heavy metals
like mercury, cadmium, lead,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:84%
arsenic, if you
have these in you,

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
they're interfering
with all your processes.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And they interfere
with brain chemistry.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So you really want to get
rid of the heavy metals.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So food isn't enough.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:10.545 align:middle line:90%
We have to do--

00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Yeah, we do
have to supplement.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Because foods just
aren't what foods used to be.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Right.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you take a tomato now
and a tomato 20 years ago,

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:90%
it's a different tomato.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Not the same.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.535 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Different
nutritive value.

00:22:22.535 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Peaches aren't peaches anymore.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: And they
don't taste the same.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I remember peaches.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember peaches?

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I remember peaches.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And I grew up in Toronto.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And we had some areas
nearby with very rich soil.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And I remember how the taste--
of course, when you're a kid,

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:90%
things taste--

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:42.210 align:middle line:84%
you have such sharp
faculties, you know?

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But what we're eating now
just doesn't have the taste,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have the nutritional
value, even if it's organic.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Best to grow it yourself
in really rich soil.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Dr. Cass,
what is addiction?

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Addiction is a
compulsive need, a craving,

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:90%
gotta have it.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:90%
That's basically it.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And with bad results.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Nothing good comes of it.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's driven by your
brain, driven in a way

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:84%
that you really don't
have control over it.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So when people are told,
just, you know, get a grip.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Just don't use.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, stay away from
cocaine, and heroin, and sugar.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Like, right.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Who are you talking to?

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
You're talking to the
part of the brain that

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
is able to process and
think, the frontal lobes.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you're
in the middle of a craving?

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.020 align:middle line:90%
They go offline.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Your frontal lobe, your
prefrontal lobe, offline.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And what's online is your
primitive brain, which is,

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:90%
got to have it.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Give me a fix.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: I want it.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.495 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I'm not OK.

00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:49.333 align:middle line:90%
I'm not safe.

00:23:49.333 --> 00:23:50.375 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: I got to have it.

00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:51.732 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Change the energy.

00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Do something now.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Again and again and again.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Why do you think there's
an epidemic of addiction

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.310 align:middle line:90%
in our culture?

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, we've
created unnatural bodies.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.865 align:middle line:90%
We're depleted.

00:24:03.865 --> 00:24:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And because we're
depleted, we're

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
looking for something
to actually replete.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have enough
of the raw materials,

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:84%
like we were talking
about serotonin,

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.305 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have enough
of the raw materials

00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
to make serotonin,
then you're going

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
to be feeling depressed,
anxious, hungry.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a kind of hunger that
you just have to keep eating.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the deficiency.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:90%
So we need to remedy that.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.620 align:middle line:90%
And we can remedy that.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.095 align:middle line:84%
So if I give somebody
some tryptophan, or 5-HTP,

00:24:37.095 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:84%
which is a relative of it--
some people do better on one,

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.887 align:middle line:84%
some people do
better on another--

00:24:40.887 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
along with some B
vitamins, that's

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
actually going to raise
the serotonin level.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And very often, that's what's
needed to cut the craving.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
products I use, as well.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.240 align:middle line:90%
For example, glutamine.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has a sugar
craving or an alcohol craving,

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:84%
they can take a
glutamine capsule.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Take a little capsule.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:90%
The ones I carry are 1,000 mg.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.167 align:middle line:84%
You open it up, put
it under your tongue

00:25:05.167 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:90%
while you're having the craving.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
If you can remember it before
your brain goes to-- like,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.895 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else.

00:25:11.895 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Out of my way.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going for the sugar.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: It absolutely
stops it in its tracks.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:90%
And people are amazed.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've had people
tell me, I can't believe it.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:90%
What's in it?

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And it will actually
stop somebody--

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
it's that powerful-- can stop
somebody from drinking, if they

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:84%
take glutamine habitually
and then use it really

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:90%
when it's needed particularly.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:90%
So we have ways.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Once you balance the brain,
all it wants is balance.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And it will grab
whatever it can.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have
tremendous anxiety.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.828 align:middle line:90%
You're going to grab a drink.

00:25:49.828 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Got to have your alcohol.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
End of the day, oh,
got to have my drink.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's going on?

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Your low in GABA.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:90%
We can take GABA.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.475 align:middle line:84%
We can take theanine and
along with some vitamins

00:26:02.475 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and minerals, because
we need the co-factors.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:84%
It's really a whole
chemistry process.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And you take that, and you
feel, oh, hey, I'm feeling OK.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.203 align:middle line:84%
And you don't
think about, gee, I

00:26:13.203 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
wonder if I should have
had that drink or not.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:90%
It just goes away.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.807 align:middle line:90%
The drink is only a symptom.

00:26:18.807 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Treating a symptom.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: It's just a symptom
of, I'm feeling like this,

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and I need a-- because
the end result of taking

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
that drink, and
another and another,

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.223 align:middle line:90%
is you go into withdrawal.

00:26:29.223 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
The same as you go into
that sugar withdrawal,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:84%
you go into the
alcohol withdrawal

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:33.652 align:middle line:90%
after a number of drinks.

00:26:33.652 --> 00:26:35.645 align:middle line:90%
And if you get really--

00:26:35.645 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
you know, you do
too much and you

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:84%
have a hangover the
next day, again,

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
it's something about the
tail of the dog or the hair--

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what the word is.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.265 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The hair of the dog.

00:26:44.265 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: The hair of
the dog that bit you.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:90%
So you drink some more.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's crazy.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But it makes sense, because the
brain that's gone offline just

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:90%
wants to feel better.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you give the brain
some good food, some protein,

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrates, complex
carbs, and fats,

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and take some of
these supplements,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
rebalance your brain.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:90%
So I want to empower people.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.417 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: I want
people to know, you

00:27:10.417 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
don't have to be at the
effect of your addiction.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.445 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
into a traditional--

00:27:14.445 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say this, but most
of the conventional addiction

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.913 align:middle line:84%
programs are based on
this willpower idea.

00:27:21.913 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:90%
But who are they talking to?

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.038 align:middle line:84%
They're talking to people
who are, for example,

00:27:25.038 --> 00:27:27.280 align:middle line:84%
in an addiction
treatment facility, who

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
are on medication, so they
can't even think straight.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you walk into
one of these places,

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.135 align:middle line:90%
and people are like--

00:27:32.135 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:90%
[GROANS]

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.484 align:middle line:90%
They are not, they're not--

00:27:35.484 --> 00:27:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Not focused.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: --sharp.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: There's no
presence there.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.678 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: And they're sitting in
groups and they're learning.

00:27:40.678 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, how can
they absorb anything?

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is, you've
got to feed them right--

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
got to give them right
supplements and nutrients.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.178 align:middle line:90%
And that's going to do it.

00:27:50.178 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Not the medication,
which is actually

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.340 align:middle line:90%
clouding them even more.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What do you think about
these addiction treatment

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
programs that have
such a high relapse--

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:84%
you know, we have 60% to 90%
of these relapses occurring.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet we continue
to process things

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:90%
the same old, traditional way.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: It's business.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What can we do
to intervene with this

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and put the power
back in the people?

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it actually
makes so much

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:84%
sense that we can balance
things out and shift our life

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Absolutely.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.270 align:middle line:90%
We absolutely can.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:84%
There are very,
very few facilities

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
around the country,
or even the world,

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
that do this, that will use
the principles that I'm talking

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.640 align:middle line:84%
about-- feeding the
people right, giving them

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
the right nutrients, giving
them saunas for detoxification,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
taking out the heavy metals,
addressing their gut health.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.310 align:middle line:84%
All of that applies
in addiction.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And once we do that,
then the person really

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:84%
has a chance of
overcoming the addiction,

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and doing it physiologically,
doing it naturally, working

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:84%
with the body's
chemistry, giving it

00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:84%
what it needs rather than
talking to a brain that

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
can't pay attention, or
giving the medication which

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.180 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately just starting
a new addiction, because it's

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:84%
really hard to get
off these psych meds.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you say in your book
that, this kind of condition

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:17.790 align:middle line:84%
can be treated with prescription
drugs, that is a myth.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.108 align:middle line:84%
Can you say a little
more about that?

00:29:20.108 --> 00:29:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, the
prescription drug, again,

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:84%
is just covering over
the symptom, and in fact,

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.990 align:middle line:90%
making them often more cloudy.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:90%
So it's a belief.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.780 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a religion.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I think psychiatry
is like a religion.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Like, give the right drug.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.990 align:middle line:84%
We just get the right
drug, and it'll work.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they work.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really--
it should not

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.772 align:middle line:84%
be the first line of
approach to an addiction.

00:29:45.772 --> 00:29:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's a little extreme.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: I mean, let's look at
why the addiction is happening.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.705 align:middle line:84%
You can say, oh,
the addiction is

00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:84%
happening because a person
had a bad experience.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:10%
They had their parents,
you know, traumatize them.

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:10%
Whatever, whatever
happened in their life,

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:10%
that's why they're addicts.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.132 align:middle line:10%
Well, that may be true.

00:30:02.132 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
when you have trauma

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.600 align:middle line:84%
is it resets your brain
in a negative way.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And you are more
prone to addiction,

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.290 align:middle line:90%
because you have an imbalance.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:90%
But that can be restored.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to do some
really good trauma work.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are some very nice
energy based trauma work

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:90%
that we can do--

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
EMDR, EFT, sensory
experiencing, and so on--

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that are body based and
very, very effective.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So you do that in conjunction
with restoring the body

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:90%
chemistry.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And meds don't really
figure in here.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this is the
kind of work that I teach.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:84%
It's teaching people how to
come back home to themselves

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:84%
from a trauma and connect, and
using the body and the breath,

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, to weave
their own new circuitry

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.060 align:middle line:84%
of having a sense of self
that they didn't have before.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying
is, and, while someone

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.450 align:middle line:84%
is in an extreme case
of such circumstances,

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that they can also be working
simultaneously with balancing

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:84%
brain chemistries and
allowing this to support

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
their efforts in healing, even
from these psychiatry based

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:84%
traumas that they've
been through,

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.070 align:middle line:90%
that it can all work together.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So Let's loop this
back around and say, OK,

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.520 align:middle line:84%
what is the role of
neurotransmitters

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to addiction?

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you just walk
us through that?

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, one of the
prominent neurotransmitters

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:90%
in addiction is dopamine.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Dopamine is the one that
makes us feel, yes, yes,

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:90%
that's great.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.600 align:middle line:90%
That feels good.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:84%
It's our ability to
focus and concentrate.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the zing that we get when
we're looking at cell phones

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.472 align:middle line:84%
or playing video
games, or, you know,

00:31:42.472 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:84%
how the kids are kind of
really stuck-- adults,

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:90%
a lot of adults, too--

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:84%
are doing these
video games, it's

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:84%
because it feeds the
dopamine reward system.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.410 align:middle line:84%
That's not such a
good way to do it.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is
we give precursors

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.952 align:middle line:90%
to dopamine-- simple.

00:31:57.952 --> 00:31:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Create it.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Protein, tyrosine.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Give some tyrosine along
with the co-factors, again.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:90%
So I just use a multivitamin.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Essential fatty acids.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:84%
By the way, throughout
all of this,

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.850 align:middle line:84%
you want to give fish
oil in good amounts,

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:84%
because the brain cells
are made out of fish oil--

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.510 align:middle line:84%
made out of the omega 3's,
which come from fish oil.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So you really don't
want your brain cells

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
to be made out of
French fry oil.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.763 align:middle line:84%
That makes for not flexible,
healthy brain cells

00:32:26.763 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
in which you're making
your neurotransmitters,

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:84%
in which the neurotransmitters
are giving their messages

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.370 align:middle line:90%
from one cell to another.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So with the dopamine, when
you give this tyrosine,

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:84%
you're actually restoring
dopamine function.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
that the whole video

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.910 align:middle line:84%
game and phone
electronic addiction

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.470 align:middle line:84%
is a whole other
thing by itself.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
powerful on the mind.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:84%
We really have to have other
means of dealing with it.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But for a lot of addictions,
when you start introducing

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.900 align:middle line:90%
the dopamine, the tyrosine--

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and the serotonin with 5-HTP
is often needed, as well--

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.170 align:middle line:84%
when you start doing
that, and even GABA--

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that particularly
with alcoholism--

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:84%
you have a real fighting chance
of overcoming the addiction,

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
naturally, where it just
becomes not a big deal.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, I had one guy who came
to me who was drinking a six

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:90%
pack a night.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Family man.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.800 align:middle line:90%
He was not going to bars.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And I gave him in
his whole regimen

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that was glutamine three times
a day and some other things.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Usually, I just dose
twice a day, actually,

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.025 align:middle line:84%
because people aren't going
to be compliant if they

00:33:34.025 --> 00:33:35.200 align:middle line:90%
have to do a third dose.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:90%
So I gave it to him.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Then I saw him four
or five weeks later

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and asked him again,
how he's doing,

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.030 align:middle line:84%
how much are you drinking,
just as a casual question.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.790 align:middle line:90%
I never made it an issue.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Never said the A-word--

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.515 align:middle line:90%
"addiction," "alcoholism."

00:33:51.515 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I just said, how much
are you drinking?

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, funny, you know, I
found a six pack in my fridge

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.900 align:middle line:90%
the other day.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:90%
And I hadn't touched it.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So he said, that's
kind of interesting.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, it's
because of what I gave you.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And you took it.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.929 align:middle line:84%
So obviously you took
what I asked you to do.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So the person
doesn't have to know.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.395 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
to use willpower.

00:34:15.395 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
white knuckle it.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not a moral issue.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.659 align:middle line:90%
It's not a willpower issue.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It's really a biochemical issue.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So oftentimes,
these things get

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:84%
started with simple issues--
with blood sugar levels

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.179 align:middle line:84%
fluctuating, hypoglycemia,
blood sugar issues.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak to that?

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I know a
lot of people that

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:39.159 align:middle line:84%
might not think that they're
addicted are kind of addicted.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.788 align:middle line:84%
And we want to tap
that person, too.

00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obvious
addictions and issues

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.788 align:middle line:84%
that people are having that
are interfering with their life

00:34:45.788 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and their relationships,
et cetera, is one thing.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But I know that there
is a massive amount

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:54.010 align:middle line:84%
of our population that is
addicted on a lower grade

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:55.989 align:middle line:84%
level, and nonetheless
it's starting

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.480 align:middle line:84%
to build these issues
that lead to anxiety,

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.393 align:middle line:84%
and depression, and an inability
to just feel joyful in life.

00:35:02.393 --> 00:35:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're leading
this stressful life.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you just speak to us
a little bit about that?

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: You start
with a good diet.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.760 align:middle line:84%
You start to eliminate
the bad stuff.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But even before you eliminate
a lot of the bad stuff,

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.900 align:middle line:90%
start eating the good stuff.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the more of
whole foods you're

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.050 align:middle line:84%
eating, the better
you're feeding

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:84%
your body and your brain,
and the less you're

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
going to feel drawn to the
other frankenfoods that are not

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:84%
contributing to your
health, let's say.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.100 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
deleterious to your health.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So as you start
eating well, and then

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:33.953 align:middle line:84%
I also start with
the supplements.

00:35:33.953 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Because that's going
to turn you around.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, giving chromium,
5-HTP, alpha-lipoic acid,

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.872 align:middle line:84%
milk thistle to
support the liver,

00:35:41.872 --> 00:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
there are a number
of nutrients you

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.060 align:middle line:84%
can take that will
actually lead you away

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:90%
from grabbing sugary things.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What you're doing is
balancing the brain chemistry.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And the cravings themselves
just start to diminish.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And the person isn't
even really having

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:84%
to try to drive it with their
minds and their willpower,

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and lock the pantry door, and
bar the refrigerator door.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.817 align:middle line:84%
But rather, there is
just a new chemistry

00:36:08.817 --> 00:36:09.900 align:middle line:90%
that is happening inside--

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Yeah, they're
feeling better.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.707 align:middle line:90%
They have more energy.

00:36:11.707 --> 00:36:13.500 align:middle line:90%
They're sleeping better.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:84%
They may be losing weight if
they wanted to lose weight.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:90%
And they notice it.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like, whoa, and
I can taste my food.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:90%
And my eyes look brighter.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And people are telling
me I look better.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
feed your body,

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.305 align:middle line:84%
even though you've abused
it for a long time, when

00:36:32.305 --> 00:36:34.422 align:middle line:84%
you start feeding it right,
it's going to respond.

00:36:34.422 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's miraculous.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.290 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We just have to give
it the nutrients

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:90%
to do what it knows how to do.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Yeah, the
body is a miracle.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it absolutely is.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's speak for
just a moment about,

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:84%
what if someone's addiction
is a dangerous addiction?

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:50.200 align:middle line:90%
They are hooked in.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeking,
they're searching,

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:56.540 align:middle line:84%
they're watching this show right
now, listening to your words.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.480 align:middle line:84%
What would you say
to someone who's

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.310 align:middle line:84%
really hooked into
something that

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:04.915 align:middle line:84%
needs some specific kind of
attention to turn it around?

00:37:04.915 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:90%
What could you say?

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.135 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: That's a tough one.

00:37:07.135 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Because to seek
professional help,

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.930 align:middle line:84%
you'll most likely
end up on medication.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:13.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the answer.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, see a naturopath, or
any kind of physician-- an ND,

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.680 align:middle line:90%
a DC, an MD, nutritionist--

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.220 align:middle line:84%
whoever can help you to
turn your diet around,

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.740 align:middle line:90%
your supplements.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.095 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's an acute-- if
you need acute detoxing,

00:37:32.095 --> 00:37:33.540 align:middle line:90%
you need acute detox.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are detox
centers that you can go to.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But then you really need
to get off the medication

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that they put you on, and go
into a program of which there

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:84%
are very few, that work more
nutritionally and organically,

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that do a real detox, detox the
heavy metals and the chemicals

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that are interfering with
your functioning well,

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and feed you right, and
give you supplements.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Very few of those.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Something else that I've been
referring for lately is NAD--

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.590 align:middle line:90%
NAD intravenous.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And generally it's a
course of 10 days of IVs.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And they're long days.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The first few could
be six hours a day.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But in 10 days, you can
really turn things around.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I've had patients who've tried
everything and wouldn't work.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.300 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, but it's too
expensive, I can't do it,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately came around
because everything else failed.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've people,
like, to this day,

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.050 align:middle line:84%
they're still free
of their addiction,

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.910 align:middle line:90%
because it turned it around.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So can you share with
our audience what NAD is

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.363 align:middle line:90%
and little bit about that?

00:38:38.363 --> 00:38:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: NAD is a
natural molecule

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that turns the mitochondria
on and helps to make ATP.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, very often there's
mitochondrial damage.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Mitochondria are the energy
centers, the energy factories

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:90%
in all our cells.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.270 align:middle line:84%
That's where all
the action happens.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So NAD is going right
to that root level

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and giving you that ATP
energy to run everything else.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's often
damaged in people

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:84%
who have addiction and
many other illnesses.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So you can do a shorter course,
say, for anti-aging or brain

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.060 align:middle line:90%
tune-ups.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But usually for addiction,
you need a 10-day course.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.503 align:middle line:84%
And there are centers around
the country that do it.

00:39:21.503 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's just
kind of a boost that

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:25.940 align:middle line:84%
uplifts everything and allows
it to get jumpstarted again.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yes.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:84%
There's also oral
nicotinamide riboside.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in an
addiction, it's best to do it.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can do a quick
detox doing that.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being in a rehab
center for 30 days or 60 days

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:84%
with the possibility of relapse,
because you're on medication,

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean the whole
thing, you do the NAD.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you also can get
off of your medications.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.700 align:middle line:84%
You start to wean off the
medication during that time.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
much more rapidly.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually stop
the substance of abuse

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:84%
if it's heroin,
cocaine, whatever, meth.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We mentioned about
SSRIs and the effects of this,

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:05.200 align:middle line:84%
or how it works to keep
serotonin in the system

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.930 align:middle line:84%
a little longer before
the reuptake happens

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:90%
by inhibiting it.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.267 align:middle line:84%
What are the long-term
effects of someone being--

00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Well, they stop working.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you can only fool
mother nature so long.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's going to prevent that--

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.300 align:middle line:90%
here's two nerve cells.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And in between the nerve
cells, this serotonin molecule

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.160 align:middle line:90%
is bouncing back and forth.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And every time it pings,
it sends a message.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, after a while, instead of
being absorbed by the receiving

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.490 align:middle line:84%
cell, it goes back out
and then does another hit.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:42.250 align:middle line:84%
After a while, you're going to
run out of serotonin molecules,

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:43.360 align:middle line:90%
just by definition.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So really, the person needs
to be given precursors.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.740 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.115 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're
told, you're not

00:40:49.115 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
supposed to mix
tryptophan with SSRIs.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I use it when I'm helping
people get off of the SSRIs.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of fooling mother
nature, which you can't really

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.200 align:middle line:90%
do for very long.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So then what they
do is they change--

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:84%
the doctor will change
it, or increase it,

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.470 align:middle line:90%
or add something else.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're on this slippery
slope of multiple meds

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and, very often, have a
feeling, like a chemical brain,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.100 align:middle line:90%
like you can't think straight.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Your feelings are kind of flat.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Flatlined.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: And you lose yourself.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.010 align:middle line:90%
You lose your soul, really.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: It's kind of scary.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We lose that connection,
that feedback system

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.520 align:middle line:90%
of having a sense of self.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just completely
numbed down.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: You're disconnected
from yourself and your emotions.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so antipsychotics,
tranquilizers, same.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah, same thing.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.295 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Same process.

00:41:39.295 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Now, so I'm not
saying, hey, get off,

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.760 align:middle line:84%
everybody should
get off their drugs.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.130 align:middle line:84%
If they're working for you,
they're working for you.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:90%
But I just know what I see.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just see a lot
of people who are

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:90%
suffering with the medications.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.840 align:middle line:84%
They haven't really
solved the problem.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:02.630 align:middle line:84%
But if the person tries to get
off of these meds, it's hard.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.967 align:middle line:84%
And most psychiatrists
will not wean off.

00:42:04.967 --> 00:42:06.800 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, you know,
you have to be on it.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.383 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say, yeah,
you can get off.

00:42:08.383 --> 00:42:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Just take a half dose
this week, and then go

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.910 align:middle line:90%
a quarter dose, and then--

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.280 align:middle line:84%
they do it much too fast,
like within a week or two,

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:16.790 align:middle line:90%
get off it.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:17.240 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:84%
The person goes into withdrawal,
and they're miserable.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:20.630 align:middle line:90%
They're terrible.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.430 align:middle line:90%
They have a terrible rebound--

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.240 align:middle line:90%
anxiety, insomnia.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And they could even
be feeling suicidal.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:30.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
their natural state.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:32.420 align:middle line:84%
That's not their
unmedicated state.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.120 align:middle line:90%
That's withdrawal.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, the brain's
been used to getting

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.830 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of stimulus,
and it's not getting it.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't know what to do.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.372 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This is very important
for people to understand.

00:42:42.372 --> 00:42:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: So what
needs to happen--

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you just,
really, the secret--

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:84%
is when you withdraw,
you withdraw probably

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.950 align:middle line:90%
like 10% to 20% every two weeks.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:90%
And you do it slowly.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.870 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you're
going to support the chemistry

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:03.805 align:middle line:84%
with the precursors
that I mentioned.

00:43:03.805 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
getting off an SSRI,

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.650 align:middle line:90%
you actually give tryptophan.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:84%
You give at least two hours
away, three hours away,

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:84%
so there won't be an opportunity
to get serotonin syndrome.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to have that.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you do that and do
it gradually, it takes over.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And your brain is
getting the serotonin

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that it needs from
a natural source.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.710 align:middle line:90%
It's making it itself.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's really learning
how to make it again.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And the drug can fall
away, and it doesn't

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.260 align:middle line:90%
have to be traumatic at all.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: And people say, oh,
I'm back to being myself.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I haven't felt
this good in years.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.730 align:middle line:90%
They have their real feelings.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like they've
retrieved their soul.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So what you're doing is--

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.930 align:middle line:84%
we speak about treating
the whole person

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and treating the cause and
not the symptoms, the effects.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
doing is addressing

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.690 align:middle line:84%
why the individual needed
to get on the medication

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:90%
in the first place and--

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Hallelujah.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --giving that
up, so that it's just

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.690 align:middle line:90%
disseminating the need.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And things are shifting again,
because you're approaching it

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.190 align:middle line:84%
from a perspective that
is one step at a time,

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:17.120 align:middle line:84%
not this all-or-nothing, not
expecting someone to have--

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.100 align:middle line:84%
just, be stronger,
and buck up, and go

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.900 align:middle line:90%
make it work for yourself.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.918 align:middle line:84%
You're taking them by the
hand and showing them,

00:44:22.918 --> 00:44:23.960 align:middle line:90%
you can turn this around.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.950 align:middle line:90%
The body is miraculous.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:25.740 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.770 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
give it the tools.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah, and you do this--

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.480 align:middle line:84%
when they finally wean
off the medication,

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.360 align:middle line:84%
they may need to continue
on the precursors

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.157 align:middle line:84%
depending on their genetics,
their stress level,

00:44:35.157 --> 00:44:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so on.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.782 align:middle line:84%
You're also working
with them in other ways

00:44:37.782 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:90%
or they're seeing a therapist.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.740 align:middle line:90%
So things change.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.573 align:middle line:90%
And the program may change.

00:44:44.573 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I also will look at the gut.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the gut is supplying a
lot of the neurotransmitters.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.990 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome is extremely
important for the brain.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.920 align:middle line:90%
It sends messages.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome,
the 4 to 5 pounds

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:58.340 align:middle line:84%
of healthy, friendly bacteria,
that make our vitamins

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and help our immune system,
that help the gut barrier.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:07.650 align:middle line:84%
They do so many things, these
wonderful, wonderful bugs.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And we wipe them out
with antibiotics.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.230 align:middle line:84%
The antibiotics don't
just kill the bad bugs.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:14.540 align:middle line:84%
They actually start to wipe
out the good bugs, too.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: And they send messages
through the vagus nerve,

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.230 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the brain.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Longest nerve in the body.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.370 align:middle line:84%
They send messages to the
brain about what to do.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.603 align:middle line:84%
So how your
microbiome is is also

00:45:25.603 --> 00:45:27.770 align:middle line:84%
going to be reflected in
how your brain's operating.

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:29.353 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Which is
actually what gives us

00:45:29.353 --> 00:45:31.670 align:middle line:84%
that sense of self,
that communication,

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that sense of well-being
and knowing who we are.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: And it's gut feelings.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That gut feeling that
we're supposed to be living by,

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.000 align:middle line:84%
not just having one
every once in a while.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be
a superhighway here,

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:44.910 align:middle line:84%
keeping us informed
all the time.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So I have another
question about ADD, ADHD,

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and the medications that
are on the market now,

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and this rising
epidemic in our culture.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Oh, yeah.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is your take,
first, on ADD and ADHD,

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.168 align:middle line:84%
and then the long-term
effects of the medications

00:46:03.168 --> 00:46:04.460 align:middle line:90%
that are being issued for this?

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: It's really the
same as everything else.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:10.370 align:middle line:84%
The kids are eating bad food,
too much sugar, food colorings,

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:90%
food additives, frankenfoods.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.630 align:middle line:84%
When you take these children,
feed them a good diet,

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.670 align:middle line:84%
remove a lot of the
electronics from their life,

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:84%
because that's
overstimulating the brain,

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.220 align:middle line:84%
also, giving them
physical activity,

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.520 align:middle line:84%
letting them have recess
where they can play outside,

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.175 align:middle line:84%
instead of being
on video games or--

00:46:30.175 --> 00:46:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Connect
with nature again.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.655 align:middle line:90%
Go figure.

00:46:32.655 --> 00:46:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Be in nature.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Play.

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:35.145 align:middle line:90%
Have free time.

00:46:35.145 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Don't be so over-scheduled.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Those are the basics you can do.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Let kids be kids.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's such a
shame what's happening.

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So they're being
diagnosed as ADD

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and put in these
chemical straitjackets.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Not a good idea.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it definitely
produces brain changes.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And these are delicate
little brains.

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:54.475 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be
messing with them.

00:46:54.475 --> 00:46:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
feeding those brains.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.820 align:middle line:84%
You want to be feeding
them the right food.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
You want to definitely
give them fish oil,

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.617 align:middle line:84%
because that's going to
really help the brain.

00:47:04.617 --> 00:47:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I have a product
called "Focus," which

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.920 align:middle line:84%
has tyrosine, phenylalanine
and some other co-factors,

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:13.910 align:middle line:84%
that also help to create
dopamine, which many

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.320 align:middle line:90%
of these children are lacking.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are lacking GABA.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So with those kids, you want
to give theanine and GABA.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.160 align:middle line:84%
You also can use something
called "neurofeedback," which

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:32.890 align:middle line:84%
is use your brain and a
computer program to retrain

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:34.610 align:middle line:90%
pathways in the brain.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very good
solution, assuming

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:40.930 align:middle line:84%
you're also going to feed
the child right at same time.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's a better solution
than, for example,

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:45.430 align:middle line:90%
giving meds forever.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a
time limited event.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.280 align:middle line:84%
You do a number of neurofeedback
sessions-- somewhere

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.517 align:middle line:90%
between 20 and 40.

00:47:52.517 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
a lot, but in terms

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.460 align:middle line:84%
of the whole lifetime
of that child,

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.050 align:middle line:90%
you really turn it around.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.660 align:middle line:84%
You really change the
neurocircuitry in a good way.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're teaching people how to
have a sense of what's going on

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:11.560 align:middle line:84%
in here, and that
they can regulate it

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.870 align:middle line:84%
with their own consciousness
and their own attention,

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and tending to themselves,
living in collaboration

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:84%
with nature, actually being
a human being, instead of

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.740 align:middle line:84%
robotically connected
to our electronics

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and living a life
outside of ourselves.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.140 align:middle line:90%
We're inviting people back home.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like the
processes that you are doing

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.490 align:middle line:90%
are working beautifully.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Have you had good results with,
effective results with the ADD,

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.120 align:middle line:90%
the ADHD--

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Oh, yeah.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --children on the
spectrum, this whole thing?

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, I've
kids go back to school.

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And after being on
the program for, say,

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:51.070 align:middle line:84%
a couple of weeks, when the
teacher will say to the mom,

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.990 align:middle line:84%
aren't you glad
that I recommended

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.810 align:middle line:90%
that he go on medication?

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:90%
And mom says, yeah.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't say anything else.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But the child is
not on medication.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:06.070 align:middle line:84%
The child's on natural
products and a better diet.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So a person
is coming to you,

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.930 align:middle line:84%
you're allowing them
a pathway to come off

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.500 align:middle line:84%
of their medications and
to come off of these drugs

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.180 align:middle line:84%
that they were
told they're going

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.910 align:middle line:84%
to be on for the
rest of their life

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:23.710 align:middle line:84%
in order to manage their life
in any kind of effective way.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of the products
I've been using lately a lot

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:33.820 align:middle line:84%
is CBD, or cannabidiol,
which is the non-THC part

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.680 align:middle line:90%
of the cannabis plant.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So I have found that to be
useful in everything from ADD,

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.760 align:middle line:84%
to eating disorders, to helping
people get off of medications,

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:90%
and other addictions.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting, because
people can become addicted to,

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.070 align:middle line:90%
say, to marijuana.

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.260 align:middle line:90%
But that's addiction to THC.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.830 align:middle line:84%
This actually neutralizes
that kind of an addiction.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And it actually neutralizes--

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.560 align:middle line:84%
CBD actually neutralizes
THC, to which a lot of people

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.580 align:middle line:84%
are reacting now, because
it's very strong these days.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:08.470 align:middle line:84%
The THC content in the products
that people are getting

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.430 align:middle line:90%
is extremely high.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And some people have a
reaction of becoming irritable,

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.920 align:middle line:90%
even violent, even psychotic.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So the treatment then is to
actually give the person CBD.

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.103 align:middle line:84%
And that will help
neutralize that THC reaction.

00:50:27.103 --> 00:50:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And we definitely want to
get into that a little bit more

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:31.310 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to make sure
that our viewers get that there

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:41.820 align:middle line:84%
is a safe way to wean
themselves from this medication

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:45.580 align:middle line:84%
prescription that's been
a regimen in their life,

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.080 align:middle line:90%
perhaps for years.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.820 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell them?

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, CBD is one of the
main products I'm using now.

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Because what it
does is it actually

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.650 align:middle line:84%
activates all the
neurotransmitters

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:90%
but in the right balance.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So I can pretty much
guess somebody needs

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.910 align:middle line:90%
more of a dopamine precursor.

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So they need more
tyrosine or phenylalanine.

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Or someone needs to have more
of a serotonin precursor.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give
tryptophan or 5-HTP.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But CBD kind of smooths
it all from another level.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's like an adaptogen
for the whole system.

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It also helps regulate hormones,
regulates neurotransmitters.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a master
regulator that helps,

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.000 align:middle line:84%
when you're getting off of
meds, when you're weaning off

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.880 align:middle line:84%
of medications, it
will help to rebalance

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.310 align:middle line:90%
the brain in a natural way.

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's adding in another
really important tool

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:45.160 align:middle line:90%
to the whole picture.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: As Dr. Cass
just shared, she

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.570 align:middle line:84%
works with the
cannabinoid, CBD, a tool

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.460 align:middle line:90%
for mental and emotional being.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
cannabis and cannabinoids.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.550 align:middle line:10%
>> So there is over 400
different parts of a cannabis

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:04.350 align:middle line:10%
plant, chemicals in the plant,
of which probably 85 to 100 are

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:10%
cannabinoids, like THC
and cannabidiol, CBD,

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.770 align:middle line:10%
which has become very popular.

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.290 align:middle line:10%
And then on top of that,
we have probably a couple

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:15.060 align:middle line:10%
of hundred different terpenes.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.760 align:middle line:10%
Terpenes are in a lot
of plants and fruits

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.340 align:middle line:10%
that gives flavor
and odor to things.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.110 align:middle line:10%
So when you smell
the cannabis plant,

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:23.790 align:middle line:10%
you're actually
smelling terpenes.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:27.720 align:middle line:10%
They actually modulate,
modify, the effects

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.550 align:middle line:10%
of the cannabinoids
in the plant.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And then there's flavonoids.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.950 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking about over
400 compounds in this plant.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:36.450 align:middle line:10%
And they all kind
of work together

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:40.640 align:middle line:10%
to give you the effect
that you are looking for.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's so far
from where I grew up.

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Cannabis was a big no-no.

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And so things are
changing rapidly.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Technology is allowing us
to prepare these things

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.192 align:middle line:84%
And it is a huge thing that is
happening right now, with a lot

00:52:55.192 --> 00:52:56.150 align:middle line:90%
of confusion out there.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So I would love for you to
share, when did you first

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.480 align:middle line:90%
become interested in this?

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:90%
What did you see?

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:02.660 align:middle line:90%
How is this happening?

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.887 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
with cannabinoids?

00:53:04.887 --> 00:53:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, going
back, when I wrote

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:09.060 align:middle line:84%
"Natural Highs" in
the early 2000s,

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I was very pro
medical marijuana,

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:18.000 align:middle line:84%
which there were panels in
the parliament in the UK.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.690 align:middle line:84%
We had panels that approved
of it for medical use.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was always squashed
by the prevailing DEA.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.260 align:middle line:90%
So that was it.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.760 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have it.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, you
know, medical marijuana

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.770 align:middle line:90%
has been available.

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And CBD came across my path.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, you know,
we have medical marijuana.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Why do we need CBD?

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.120 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like an
excuse to get high.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.350 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Then I began to read about it.

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
the light went on.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Wow, this is something to
counter any negative issues

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that people are having with the
very strong THC cannabis that

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:01.250 align:middle line:90%
is sold recreationally.

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.070 align:middle line:90%
So I began.

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:03.445 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
read the research.

00:54:03.445 --> 00:54:09.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of research,
like over 8,000 papers on CBD.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, also, when I'm
talking about CBD,

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking just
about cannabidiol,

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:16.910 align:middle line:90%
which is a single cannabinoid.

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Even though THC and CBD are
the main ones in the cannabis

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.120 align:middle line:84%
plant, but there are also
other cannabinoids, probably

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.230 align:middle line:90%
over 100.

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are also the terpenes,
flavonoids, vitamins, minerals,

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.380 align:middle line:90%
amino acids, the whole plant.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I use with my
patients is full spectrum hemp

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:44.090 align:middle line:84%
extract, which legally, if you
have 0.3% or less THC content,

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:48.470 align:middle line:84%
counts as a CBD product
and does not have

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:49.760 align:middle line:90%
to be sold at a dispensary.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It could be sold
online, in stores.

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.460 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.890 align:middle line:90%
It's readily available.

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It had a problem in that it
was associated with marijuana

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.880 align:middle line:84%
legally as Schedule
I. And "Schedule I"

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:06.750 align:middle line:84%
means it has no redeeming value
and it's a substance of abuse.

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is the US government--

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Schedule I.

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:10.400 align:middle line:90%
FDA.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.800 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the FDA
holds a patent on marijuana

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.410 align:middle line:90%
as a medical substance.

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.810 align:middle line:90%
So a little paradox here.

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:24.072 align:middle line:84%
No medical use, but they
have a patent on medical use.

00:55:24.072 --> 00:55:24.896 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:55:24.896 --> 00:55:25.696 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Hmm.

00:55:25.696 --> 00:55:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: You can wonder
about that, also.

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So I began to
really look into it,

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and began using
it on my patients.

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:33.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was very happy.

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I had a new tool in my tool box.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always expanding
what I do, anyway.

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was it
added another dimension.

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.980 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, it boosts
the neurotransmitters,

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:50.462 align:middle line:84%
balances the
neurotransmitters, increasing

00:55:50.462 --> 00:55:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the ones that need
to be increased,

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.270 align:middle line:84%
decreasing the action of the
ones that don't, and balancing

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:59.780 align:middle line:84%
hormones, balancing
the immune system.

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It even helps with
bone, with bone growth.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So menopausal symptoms, PMS,
because it balances hormones.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.320 align:middle line:90%
So it has many, many uses.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And in psychiatry, I'm
using it for things

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:19.520 align:middle line:84%
like post-traumatic stress
disorder, anxiety, depression.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.070 align:middle line:90%
It's been useful for autism.

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, autism
spectrum, often those parents

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:30.650 align:middle line:84%
find that adding in a little
THC is actually helpful.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's been said
that adding in some THC

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:35.330 align:middle line:90%
activates the CBD better.

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:38.690 align:middle line:84%
I've been sticking
to straight CBD,

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:42.380 align:middle line:84%
partly because even the 0.3%
can be felt by some people.

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.270 align:middle line:84%
It can also accumulate
in the fat cells

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and show up unwantedly
in a drug test

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.330 align:middle line:84%
for people that are
being tested at work.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Sure.

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: So I have
had a lot of success

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.920 align:middle line:84%
just using a full spectrum
hemp extract that is non-THC.

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one that I
carry and give to my patients.

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Complexities,
applications, benefits,

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:09.440 align:middle line:84%
all of this that is
surrounding this one thing.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I just want to backup
for just a moment

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and say, for those that
are new to the whole idea,

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:18.110 align:middle line:84%
even though it's flourishing
in a lot of arenas,

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:19.940 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of
conversation, some people

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:23.375 align:middle line:84%
might not really
get what is CBD.

00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Just, let's break it way down--

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:29.370 align:middle line:84%
super simple introduction,
sentence or two.

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:31.530 align:middle line:90%
What is CBD?

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: What it is, it is part
of the endocannabinoid system,

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:39.570 align:middle line:84%
which wasn't really
fleshed out till the '90s

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:43.530 align:middle line:84%
by Professor Raphael
Mechoulam in Israel.

00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
a lot of research

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:46.930 align:middle line:90%
on the endocannabinoid system.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So here it was hidden
in plain sight.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.520 align:middle line:84%
We've always had this system,
we just didn't know it.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And can you share what
that system is for people?

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: It's basically
to help us relax.

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It helps to protect us.

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:02.820 align:middle line:90%
It helps us to mitigate stress.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:07.380 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a built-in monitor.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Like a regulator.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:15.490 align:middle line:84%
An adaptogen. And
very, very powerful.

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.633 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a low
endocannabinoid system,

00:58:17.633 --> 00:58:19.800 align:middle line:84%
when you don't have enough
of these endocannabinoids

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.550 align:middle line:84%
that your body makes-- your
body makes anandamide and 2-AG,

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:25.920 align:middle line:84%
those are the ones
we know about.

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.720 align:middle line:84%
When your body is not
making enough of those,

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.630 align:middle line:84%
you're much more prone to
anxiety, depression, PTSD,

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:38.852 align:middle line:84%
and all the other issues that
are actually helped with CBD.

00:58:38.852 --> 00:58:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we give
CBD, we're actually

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:44.020 align:middle line:84%
boosting the individual's
endocannabinoid system.

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So we use phytocannabinoids,
which are herb based,

00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:48.440 align:middle line:90%
cannabis based.

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And there are other plants
that also supply cannabinoids.

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:58.310 align:middle line:84%
We're using them to stimulate
the natural endocannabinoids.

00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So it works in a
very elegant way.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.060 align:middle line:90%
There was a study.

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.570 align:middle line:84%
This is an
interesting study done

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:08.510 align:middle line:84%
with people who had been
affected by the World Trade

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Center disaster.

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: 9/11.

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: And the ones
who develop PTSD--

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.020 align:middle line:84%
same exposure-- the
ones who develop PTSD

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:23.280 align:middle line:84%
were shown to have a low
endocannabinoid system.

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.460 align:middle line:84%
The ones who didn't
develop PTSD had

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:30.740 align:middle line:84%
higher endocannabinoid levels,
and therefore more resiliency.

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.460 align:middle line:84%
They had more
built-in protection.

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So in that experiment,
I would like

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to see then take the
people that were affected,

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:41.193 align:middle line:84%
give them CBD, and see
what happens to their PTSD.

00:59:41.193 --> 00:59:43.110 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't what the
experiment was about.

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:44.940 align:middle line:84%
But it does show that
certain people have

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:49.620 align:middle line:84%
low endocannabinoid system,
which makes predisposes them

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.940 align:middle line:90%
to all these other issues.

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the
endocannabinoid system,

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.980 align:middle line:84%
system of chemicals
in our body that

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.740 align:middle line:84%
are sitting there, waiting
to help regulate and help

00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:02.140 align:middle line:84%
monitor and process our
level of well-being,

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
our ability to process and
cope and engage with life,

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and when that is a
low in an individual,

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:12.930 align:middle line:84%
then these externally oriented
cannabinoids are being utilized

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.760 align:middle line:90%
to enhance that system.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's flourishing
in our culture right now.

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think that
the endocannabinoid system

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.620 align:middle line:84%
is suppressed so
much in our culture,

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
utilize these things

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:32.320 align:middle line:84%
from an external processing
in order to find that balance?

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Yeah, really
good question.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I think one issue is stress.

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And also if people
have had early stress,

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:43.320 align:middle line:84%
it lowers their
endocannabinoid system.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.365 align:middle line:90%
Early PTSD.

01:00:44.365 --> 01:00:45.240 align:middle line:90%
And we talked about--

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned the
ASA study before.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We had early trauma,
it predisposes you

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to all these other issues, which
in fact CBD helps to mitigate.

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:54.750 align:middle line:90%
It enhances the immune system.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:01:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It reduces inflammation, reduces
pain, all of these things.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
it's supposed to do.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And the body actually makes
releases 2-AG and anandamide

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.870 align:middle line:90%
on demand.

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's released locally in
the area that it's needed.

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:13.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's very elegant.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not just floating around.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It's manufactured on
the spot as needed.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:19.622 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Supply demand.

01:01:19.622 --> 01:01:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah.

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so in
this, you know, you're

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:25.348 align:middle line:84%
saying that sometimes there
are levels of these things that

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
can show up in a test at work
that might cause problems

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:29.400 align:middle line:90%
for someone.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Does it also have the
potential to, with someone

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
who has just a borderline
sensitivity, create a high?

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Does it still have
that impact, or can it?

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, THC is
what creates the high.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.710 align:middle line:90%
CBD doesn't create a high.

01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It will give you a
sense of well-being,

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
because it will reduce anxiety
and also help with depression.

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So you feel good, but
it's not a high feeling

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:01.463 align:middle line:84%
that you would
get, say, with THC.

01:02:01.463 --> 01:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So then
would people become

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
dependent on CBD to maintain
that sense of well-being?

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
that you're utilizing

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
as a process toward
some other end?

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Or are we expecting them now
to need to be on CBD long-term?

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: That's very individual.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people are able to do
it and then stay off it.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
For example, there was a
smoking study getting people

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.440 align:middle line:90%
off nicotine.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So they took CBD during the
time of smoking cessation

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
for a certain
period time, stopped

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
the CBD at the end
of the experiment,

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
but when they were
followed months later,

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
still had not
returned to smoking

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and had not returned
to taking CBD.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So the brain has
some plasticity,

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.740 align:middle line:90%
this neuroplasticity.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Things will just change.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Your brain structure,
your brain function,

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.530 align:middle line:84%
will change as a
result of using CBD.

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And other people, they may
need to take it long-term.

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's also very individual
in terms of how much to take.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Some people will
need 1/2 a drop.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.307 align:middle line:84%
Or some people will
need a whole drop.

01:03:01.307 --> 01:03:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this, because
there's also the fact

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
that there's bottles that
have 250 milligrams in them

01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
or 500 milligrams in
them or 1,500 milligrams.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:12.390 align:middle line:84%
The ones I carry have
500 milligrams and 1,500.

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a bottle that
says 500 milligrams on it,

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
you're not getting
500 in each squirt,

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
in each squirt that we draw
it up in the dropper bottom.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
In the 500 milligrams,
a 2-ounce bottle,

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
you're getting 8.3
milligrams per dose.

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.140 align:middle line:90%
You may not need to know this.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.057 align:middle line:84%
You really just need to
experiment with what's

01:03:33.057 --> 01:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%
going to work for you.

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.950 align:middle line:90%
So start--

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.112 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So someone can
self select and decide,

01:03:37.112 --> 01:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
this was too much, this was
not enough, I need to do more--

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: You can feel when--

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
it's easier when you have an end
result that you're looking for.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.930 align:middle line:90%
When I've given it--

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I gave it to a friend
of mine with sciatica,

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:51.250 align:middle line:90%
and he had to walk a trade show.

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:52.620 align:middle line:90%
That was not a good thing.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.037 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
take a narcotic.

01:03:54.037 --> 01:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Which he had, but he
didn't want to take it.

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to cloud
his consciousness.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:59.060 align:middle line:90%
So I gave him CBD for it.

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
And this was for the first time.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So he took it, took
a couple of droppers.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
oh, sciatica's gone.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So I gave him the bottle to
take throughout the show.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.420 align:middle line:90%
And it worked on the spot.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it just kept working,
because he had the target

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:15.010 align:middle line:84%
symptoms, and he could tell
exactly how much he needed

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:16.770 align:middle line:90%
and how often.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you don't
have a target symptom.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people are just
taking it just to take it,

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and they notice, oh,
I kind of feel better.

01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm
functioning better.

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
That shoulder pain
just went away.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Or they're taking it for PMS,
and something else goes away,

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:34.050 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, they may have a shoulder
pain, or some muscle tension

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:39.280 align:middle line:90%
that goes away.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So it has side benefits
rather than side effects.

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.303 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I was going to ask, side
effects, warnings, anything

01:04:43.303 --> 01:04:43.790 align:middle line:90%
to be concerned about?

01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Yes, side
effects, you want to know.

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, some people get--

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:49.545 align:middle line:90%
anything can affect anyone.

01:04:49.545 --> 01:04:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody
has a side effect,

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and they say that's due
to CBD, it could be.

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we have our
own sensitivities.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
It's quite safe, quite a
large margin of safety.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And some people may feel
a little queasy from it.

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes people feel sleepy.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
In that case, it's good
to take it bedtime.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very good for sleep.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Does the
queasiness pass if someone

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:13.540 align:middle line:90%
is experiencing that?

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yeah.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They acclimate to it?

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Or--

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:16.648 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: They can, yeah.

01:05:16.648 --> 01:05:18.325 align:middle line:90%
It's so much an experiment.

01:05:18.325 --> 01:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, you just keep trying
and getting the right dose

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.190 align:middle line:90%
and how often.

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:25.973 align:middle line:84%
So I had one woman
who would take--

01:05:25.973 --> 01:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
I have a CALM product.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.265 align:middle line:84%
So she'd take the CALM product
in the morning and the CBD

01:05:29.265 --> 01:05:31.140 align:middle line:84%
in the evening, because
it made her sleepy.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So the CALM calmed down enough
to take her exams, together

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.030 align:middle line:90%
with taking CBD at night.

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was her
perfect combination.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.438 align:middle line:84%
So people have their
own combinations.

01:05:39.438 --> 01:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Safe to take
with medications?

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.242 align:middle line:84%
Any contraindications
with medications

01:05:44.242 --> 01:05:45.450 align:middle line:90%
that people are currently on?

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Usually, if you stay
under 100 milligrams-- that's

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
what the milligram part does,
have some significance--

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.070 align:middle line:84%
if you stay under 100
milligrams of the full spectrum,

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:58.552 align:middle line:84%
you're pretty much going to
avoid any kind of interaction.

01:05:58.552 --> 01:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
If you want to look,
you can look at what

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:04.580 align:middle line:84%
which enzyme in the P450
enzyme system of the liver

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
is breaking down CBD and
breaking down, metabolizing

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.040 align:middle line:90%
that particular medication.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
If it's the same one, then there
will be a mutual influence.

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So it could make the
medication list effective.

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to
allow for all of that.

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interesting.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.522 align:middle line:84%
Interesting that it might make
the medication less effective,

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:27.710 align:middle line:84%
because it's harmonizing
something else in the body.

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And the medication might
not be needed as it was.

01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: But the P450
system, the enzymes

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:36.850 align:middle line:84%
are going to break down the
CBD and not the medication.

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
It could be breaking down
the medication not the CBD.

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be cognizant
of what's happening.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right, right.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.010 align:middle line:90%
So how does one acquire CBD?

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Dispensaries?

01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:50.855 align:middle line:90%
What you need to do?

01:06:50.855 --> 01:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: You don't have
to go to a dispensary.

01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
That's governed by law in
each state and each city.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's a whole other
issue that I don't get into.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I just have-- you know,
you can order it online,

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:07.280 align:middle line:84%
you can get it in
various stores.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
You want to make
sure of your source.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
You want to know where it's
coming from, that it's clean,

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.582 align:middle line:84%
non-GMO, and that
it's effective.

01:07:14.582 --> 01:07:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how is someone
going to know if it's clean?

01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:18.585 align:middle line:90%
How is someone going to know?

01:07:18.585 --> 01:07:20.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it'll say on the label?

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Is it regulated like the other
products that one purchases?

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
How does one trust
what they're accessing?

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: You need to
trust the company.

01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:31.670 align:middle line:90%
A C of A--

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:34.063 align:middle line:84%
Certificate of
Analysis-- is useful,

01:07:34.063 --> 01:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
which will say what the
different cannabinoids are--

01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What the process is.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: --what the toxins
are that are found in it.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Are there heavy metals?

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Are there pesticides?

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.490 align:middle line:90%
And that was a real problem.

01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It still is a very bad
problem with underground weed,

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
because people
are buying product

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that's grown with pesticides,
are treated with herbicides.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's really affecting
people negatively.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So how does one select?

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.850 align:middle line:84%
What do they--
how do they begin?

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:07.310 align:middle line:84%
How would you suggest that
they begin in their selection

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:08.110 align:middle line:90%
process?

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Anything you can offer?

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:11.777 align:middle line:90%


01:08:11.777 --> 01:08:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: You know, I'd say,
check with your doctor.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.020 align:middle line:90%
But doctors don't tend to know.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I carry a brand that I
really like that I actually

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
manufacture myself, because I
checked it out, and I like it,

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and it works.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.319 align:middle line:84%
And it has a nice lemony
flavor instead of that kind

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:27.359 align:middle line:84%
of heavy grassy flavor
that a lot of it

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
has that make it kind
of yucky to go down.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- [GROANS]
So that's what I do.

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are other good
brands on the market, as well.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.569 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And is there something
specifically in the labeling

01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that someone could
look for that you

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:45.930 align:middle line:84%
might help someone
be able to navigate

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:47.689 align:middle line:90%
their way through this?

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Well, you
want to know how much,

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.377 align:middle line:84%
how many milligrams
are in the bottle.

01:08:54.377 --> 01:08:55.835 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
how many per dose.

01:08:55.835 --> 01:08:58.819 align:middle line:90%


01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:00.439 align:middle line:84%
You don't want any
extra things in it.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:01.029 align:middle line:84%
Although, there
are some of them.

01:09:01.029 --> 01:09:02.404 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
some nice ones

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that have added
other ingredients,

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.540 align:middle line:90%
like good ingredients.

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's say, there's extra
melatonin, or extra turmeric,

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.160 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So then they're getting pretty
fancy with the different CBDs.

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I say start with a basic CBD.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And as I said, I like mine.

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And I call it "hemp oil
extract," not "CBD."

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.899 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a hemp oil extract.

01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
CBD is just that one, you
know, that one cannabinoid

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:28.029 align:middle line:90%
called cannabidiol.

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
But you really want to have
full spectrum with the terpenes

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.149 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Will cannabis be a
game changer in mental health?

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: I think it is.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I-- totally.

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Where do you
see it happening?

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:44.592 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: I see that the
public is accepting it.

01:09:44.592 --> 01:09:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're bringing
it to their doctors.

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And there are doctors
who say, I don't know.

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But as doctors get more
and more familiar with it--

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and I actually speak
at medical conferences

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.890 align:middle line:90%
about the medical use of CBD.

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Generally it's conferences
that have more alternative

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
kinds of practitioners,
so it's not mainstream.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.547 align:middle line:90%
But we're getting there.

01:10:05.547 --> 01:10:06.380 align:middle line:90%
We're getting there.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
important for people

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
to try it, use it,
go to practitioners

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
who do understand it if
they want some help there.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's making inroads.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely making inroads.

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very happy about that,
because it is a game changer.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I know it has
affected my practice.

01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just made it easier
to get people off meds,

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to get people feeling better
in general, even if they're not

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.290 align:middle line:90%
on meds.

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, it boosts
neurotransmitters.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And the terpenes have
so many good effects--

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:44.230 align:middle line:84%
anti-inflammatory, and for
pain, and just on and on.

01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
one stop shopping.

01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
panacea, but it's

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
only in that the endocannabinoid
system is ubiquitous

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:56.398 align:middle line:90%
in all systems of the body.

01:10:56.398 --> 01:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So of course it's going to
have all those good effects,

01:10:58.690 --> 01:11:00.783 align:middle line:84%
because it's affecting
so many systems.

01:11:00.783 --> 01:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then
when someone feels

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.570 align:middle line:84%
more grounded and available,
and has more energy,

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and is stressed less, they're
more available for what

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
you might be also offering them
through means of psychotherapy,

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and working with them,
retraining themselves,

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and to have a new image
of self, and to really

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
take on life from a personal
responsibility perspective.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Because they feel that they can,
instead of feeling overwhelmed.

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:28.270 align:middle line:84%
We want this to be part
of a bigger program

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:30.427 align:middle line:84%
rather than someone
just taking the droppers

01:11:30.427 --> 01:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
and going on through life.

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: Oh, I love that
you're saying that.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
going to conferences.

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And been going to
the conferences

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
where health practitioners
are talking about,

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:44.550 align:middle line:90%
say, medical marijuana.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And I can't believe how
they're seeing it in isolation.

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.150 align:middle line:90%


01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Very few of them are
practicing functional medicine

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.810 align:middle line:90%
or integrative medicine.

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:58.055 align:middle line:84%
These are all allopathic
practitioners who have found--

01:11:58.055 --> 01:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, they've
seen the light,

01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:01.472 align:middle line:84%
and they're using,
prescribing medical marijuana.

01:12:01.472 --> 01:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's not where I-- and
I'm talking about CBD anyway.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
medical marijuana.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But by the same token,
when I hear that,

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
it's not that CBD is coming
in and being a panacea.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.750 align:middle line:90%
It's part of an entire system--

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:19.290 align:middle line:84%
of lifestyle, diet,
nutrients, eating organically,

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
looking at the gut,
looking at hormones.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of
this whole system.

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And people's social
relationships,

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual connection,
it's part of a holistic package.

01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CASS: So thank you
for bringing that up.

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Absolutely.

01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:39.540 align:middle line:84%
This whole spectrum,
full spectrum,

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.290 align:middle line:84%
we're meant to be
playing the whole thing.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And even though a traditional
medical practitioner,

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
a physician that has
never been integrative

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and is now prescribing
these types of things,

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
probably because of patient
demand, patient inquiry,

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
at least it's opening
a door that they're

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
bridge that gap, too,

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.650 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, and
eventually see that there

01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is an entire lifestyle, a whole
perspective of living that

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
needs to be addressed
and returned to humanity.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
we're encouraging here.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Amen.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.422 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
about empowerment.

01:13:14.422 --> 01:13:15.255 align:middle line:10%
This is empowerment.

01:13:15.255 --> 01:13:15.830 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: That's it.

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:16.630 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:19.500 align:middle line:10%
>>CASS: And I really urge
people to take their own power.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Take control over your life.

01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Take control over your health.

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:23.860 align:middle line:90%
It is so rewarding.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for what
you're doing in this arena.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Please tell us, how
can people find you?

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
How can they learn more
about what you're sharing

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and bring it home
for themselves?

01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:37.330 align:middle line:10%
>>CASS: I have a
website, cassmd.com--

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.240 align:middle line:10%
C-A-S-S-M-D dot com.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.930 align:middle line:10%
And they can send away
for a free questionnaire

01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:46.500 align:middle line:10%
for their brain, to
see where they fit in.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And there is also a download
there of my "Reclaim Your

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Brain."

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Excellent.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So people can learn
more, read more,

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.620 align:middle line:84%
find you if they're interested
in digging in a little deeper.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Yes.

01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your brilliance,
your integrative approach,

01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
everything that you're
sharing with us about brain

01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
chemistries, and
neurotransmitters, and foods,

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that we can take
it back into our own hands

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and do so in a responsible
fashion that is safe,

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:17.385 align:middle line:84%
that is reproducible,
and that is effective.

01:14:17.385 --> 01:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for being with us today.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Oh, my pleasure.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wonderful.

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CASS: Really, thank you.

01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Indeed.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Too often we tell ourselves
that we need to fill something--

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to eat, to drink, to take
a medication, anything,

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.690 align:middle line:90%
just to feel better.

01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But could it be that we simply
need the right nutrients

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:36.780 align:middle line:90%
to reclaim our brain?

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cass and her approach
is turning a whole paradigm

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.790 align:middle line:90%
of mental health on its head.

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter.

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
watching "Healing Matrix."

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:51.222 align:middle line:90%
