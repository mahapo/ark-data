00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE MORTER: Given today's
ever-growing mental health

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
crisis, psychedelic
therapy is emerging

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:84%
as an alternative modality for
bringing about profound change

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:90%
when other means have failed.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:84%
In the treatment
of most challenging

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
emotional struggles,
especially trauma,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics have been shown
to have exceptional efficacy.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Our guest today, Daniel
McQueen, and his Center

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:84%
for Medicinal Mindfulness,
have become established leaders

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of the movement to provide safe
and legal psychedelic medicine

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
experiences for personal
and global healing

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:90%
and transformation.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Daniel, thanks so much for
being here with us today.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL MCQUEEN: Thank
you for having me, Dr. Sue.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.493 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:01:03.493 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So tell us
about your background.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.877 align:middle line:84%
How did you come
to do this work?

00:01:06.877 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Well, I had an
interest in psychedelics

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.390 align:middle line:84%
my whole adult life, and I was
part of some communities that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:90%
use psychedelics intentionally.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
that wasn't enough,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
so I got my master's in
transpersonal counseling

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
psychology so I could
study the psychology

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:90%
behind these medicines.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And just my own personal
path of healing as well.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.478 align:middle line:84%
That was really
important for me.

00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: There's certainly
a lot of curiosity

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
about this in our
culture today, and I'm

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
so happy to hear that
you are going about this

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:84%
in a structured,
responsible fashion,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
provide information

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
for people in a safe,
administered environment.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about your Center
for Medicinal Mindfulness.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Well, we started in
2014 when cannabis became legal

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I also work out of a
yoga studio for large groups

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
using cannabis, and also breath
work as psychedelic medicines.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And we have a six-office clinic
here in Boulder, Colorado,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
using ketamine-assisted
psychotherapy as well.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So I work with several licensed
professional counselors

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and psychiatrists, massage
therapists, energy workers,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and other healers to provide
mostly trauma resolution

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:90%
healing for people.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wonderful.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:90%
So let's start at the beginning.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned the yoga
center and breath work.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And can you just
say a little bit

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
about how breath is
helping in this same arena

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and tell us a little
bit about the effects?

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Sure.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, we use a particular
breath work practice

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that induces what would be
considered a psychedelic state.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
somatic experience,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and it helps literally
shake trauma out of the body

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
either through trembling, or
even what looks like spasms

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:90%
and convulsing.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a way to
reset the mind state,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:84%
reset the body to reach
a deeper homeostasis

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and creates space for healing
that the body naturally

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:90%
does anyway.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
It's also a way to discharge
stuck energy in the body, which

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
also seems to be a factor
in post-traumatic stress

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:90%
and trauma.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So I teach
breath work as well,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very familiar with
the beautiful outcomes that

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Can you share a little bit
about the specific types

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
of breathing patterns that
you're speaking about?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Sure.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:84%
This one came from
rebirthing breath work.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's a strong.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Inhale and a relaxed
exhale, but it's circular,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
so there's no pauses at the
top or bottom of the breath.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And we found that big
breathing is very evocative,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
but people can heal,
also, with gentle breath.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's the circular
pattern that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the most
important factor.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So can you just
demonstrate a little bit of it

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
for us to show us
what's happening?

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.565 align:middle line:84%
Is it inhale,
exhale mouth, nose?

00:03:57.565 --> 00:03:59.857 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Through the mouth,
generally, but both work.

00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just more through the mouth
to get more air in the body.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And it's belly initiated?

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: I prefer the belly.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I feel like the belly breath
is more transformational.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:84%
When people do chest
breathing, it's

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
more of a confidence builder,
but that's a style that we use.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's just like this.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.964 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:90%
[SHORT INHALES]

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's kind
of a sipping in,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and then just a gentle
release, and over and over

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and over and over, all of this
activating internal healing

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:84%
energies that we're
going after, yes?

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: It's like
a charged homeostasis.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I like to think,
in spiritual terms,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
of energy or chi
entering the body

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:90%
and super charging the body.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And it just has to
break through blockages.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere
else for it to go.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And so it can look a little
funny and a little different,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
but that's just what
healing looks like for sure.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What other benefits
do you see happening

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.987 align:middle line:90%
because of the breath work?

00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Well, primarily
it's like a break

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:90%
free from stuckness.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So think of depression as a
form of stuckness or heaviness

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
It can break that excess
stuckness out of the body.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:90%
It reduces anxiety.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.367 align:middle line:84%
So imagine anxiety
as just energy,

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't know where
to go or it can't leave,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
so it can release that energy.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Trauma, as tension in the
body, can be released.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So any of the mental health
concerns can benefit from this.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It's very safe, so it
can be used by anybody.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But on the positive end of
the spectrum, good ideas,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.885 align:middle line:90%
inspirations, problem solving.

00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes there's
stuckness in life.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to resolve
a concern we have a friend,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:90%
or something's going on at work.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Or in my work, I get a lot
of ideas in these spaces,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and I can then implement
them in my life.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way to
move life forward.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: In a proactive fashion,
tapping our creativity

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:90%
and genius.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.158 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: All of that, yeah.

00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So it clears-- it
creates space for us

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:84%
so that we're
light in our bodies

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
so that we have the
capacity to do these things.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And then it gives us
inspirational ideas and support

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:90%
to step into what we want to do.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:90%
So to me, it's like a both and.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Daniel, what do you
think the relationship

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:90%
with treating trauma is here?

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.827 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to
the mechanism there?

00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Well, it
activates both the fight

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
or flight response of the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But it also activates the
parasympathetic nervous system

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:90%
of deep relaxation.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So it creates this
charged homeostasis,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and it allows the body
to reset in that space.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.635 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, to me,
a lot of what trauma is

00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
is just stuckness
is in the body.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But there's also stuckness in
the psyche or mental states.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is people are

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:90%
able to resolve their histories.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Memories come back
spontaneously,

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:84%
but in a way that feels
safe and supported and held.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the neurological
patterns that

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
get stuck in the
base of our brain

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
are able to reenter the
frontal cortex and complete.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that stuckness
that happens

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:84%
there, which causes
a lot of the anxiety

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and the psychological
symptoms, gets released.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what is it
about breath work that

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:90%
equates to psychedelic therapy?

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.958 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to bridge
those worlds for people.

00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Well,
it's often described

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.600 align:middle line:84%
as a non-medicine
psychedelic experience.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So if we were going to
look at the mechanisms,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
it increases CO2 in
the body, and there's

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
evidence that's showing
that when CO2 is increased

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
in the lungs and
in the bloodstream,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that endogenous
DMTs are released,

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and then that might be what's
creating the psychedelic state.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a way to induce
an endogenous psychedelic

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And the experiences
themselves, they're

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
hard to distinguish sometimes
from a psychedelic healing

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So if someone is to come
to the Medicinal Mindfulness

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:84%
space, what might they
anticipate experiencing?

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah,
well we sit and chat.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I have tea or water available.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:90%
We just get to know each other.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.008 align:middle line:90%
We talk about intention.

00:08:13.008 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, what do you wish
to gain from the experience?

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And kind of let that
unfold a little bit.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I help them explore it
further and really get

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:90%
to the core of what--

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.977 align:middle line:84%
I say if something
could shift that was

00:08:24.977 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
really important in your
life, what would that be?

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And we work with that
question for a little while.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.785 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So they kind
of set an intention

00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
before they go into
the breath work.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.558 align:middle line:84%
And then we just do
some how to's and how

00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:37.223 align:middle line:84%
to do the practice, especially
if it's their first time.

00:08:37.223 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So do they
tend to come out

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
of the session feeling relieved,
like better, or do they

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:90%
get jolted by what unveils?

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Or what, on an emotional level,
at the end of the session,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.873 align:middle line:90%
might someone be aware of?

00:08:52.873 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah, sure.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Usually they just feel a lot
more spacious in their bodies

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:90%
and their psyches.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
realizations that come.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, yes, difficult
things can emerge,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
particularly traumatic
experiences in the past.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.673 align:middle line:90%
Childhood memories can come up.

00:09:07.673 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually
always in a space

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of resolution and movement
towards health and healing.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, under
difficult memories,

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
there's always these gifts of
understanding or reframing,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:84%
self-acceptance, compassion
for all involved.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:84%
These are just natural
byproducts of the experience.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I
tell people to let

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
go of getting through
everything in one session.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So sure, there's some
things that are incomplete.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:90%
But then we just go back in.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of encouragement
and acceptance

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that whatever it looks like,
that's what healing looks like.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:90%
So I trust that.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.298 align:middle line:84%
Our culture could
certainly use more of that.

00:09:45.298 --> 00:09:47.715 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at one of
Daniel's breath work sessions.

00:09:47.715 --> 00:09:50.495 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.495 --> 00:09:51.992 align:middle line:90%
[DRUMS BEATING]

00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:53.988 align:middle line:90%
[RHYTHMIC BREATHING]

00:09:53.988 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So they are mostly
just in the breath,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and the body is doing these
reactions, et cetera, because

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
of the exchange that's happening
chemically and neurologically.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Right.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.667 align:middle line:84%
You can see the discharges
happening through the legs.

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But there's also this movement
in the hips that was more

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:90%
of a Kundalini-type experience.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:90%
So it's clearing.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:84%
It's also activating
the meridians

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and rising the energy up
through the body as well.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.843 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
hear the drumming.

00:10:52.843 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And so was this--

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.322 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: That was
a live music set.

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So at the
beginning of the session,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:84%
it's more kind of
rhythmic like that.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:90%
And what is this role of sound?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Can you say more about that?

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
human system is made

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:90%
of light and sound vibration.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:90%
We are energy beings.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And so these different wave
forms of energy and music

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:90%
play a role.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Can you share your experience?

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a lack of
separation between the music

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and the body after
a certain point.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
People will actually twitch
or vibrate to the rhythm

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:90%
and to the music.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's also used to help
stay with the experience

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and then amplify the
experience when ready.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So the music will
get faster, stronger.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And we use it to match the
experience so that people don't

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:90%
get shy about their process.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.252 align:middle line:84%
So if people start getting
loud, the music gets--

00:11:39.252 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The music gets louder.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: It's
like the music holds

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:90%
the experience for people.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So I can imagine
that it gives people--

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I know this happens in
the breath work sessions

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing--
that it gives people

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
this experience of a larger
version of themselves,

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that they belong, and
there's this communion--

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:84%
you call it community
breathing-- that there's

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
this universal intelligence
that actually becomes

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.360 align:middle line:84%
a part of our own personal
experience, which tends

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to soften our woes that
we're trapped inside

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:84%
of in our individual
life experiences.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So as this is happening, what
is the role of the facilitator?

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.830 align:middle line:90%
What is your role there?

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Well,
fundamentally, it's

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
just to ensure that everybody
stays physically safe.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So we keep an eye
on everybody, make

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
sure they're there in a
breath that works for them.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So some people are
breathing gently,

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and others are
breathing very strongly.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're just keeping
an eye on things.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Never had an issue
of anybody, like,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
vibrating off their mat
or anything like that.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's something
we pay attention to

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.972 align:middle line:84%
so that people are allowed
to have their own experience

00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and know that they're
going to be held but not

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:90%
interfered with.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And then energetically,
we move a lot of energy

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:90%
through the space.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we do
these group spaces,

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
it's not uncommon for people
across the room from each other

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to be moving the
exact same ways.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.023 align:middle line:84%
You'll see ripples happen
through people's bodies.

00:12:59.023 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we're just
paying attention

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
to the energetics
of the space as well

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and directing it all back into
the earth to be transformed.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.955 align:middle line:84%
And then if anybody needs an
intervention, we're there.

00:13:11.955 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:84%
We're right there
with them, so holding

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:84%
hands or reassuring
words, and just

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.863 align:middle line:84%
ensuring that they know that
they're held and protected.

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So helpful
for people to be

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
able to access something
that's rising up,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and to know this is a safe
space for me to actually connect

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.193 align:middle line:90%
It can be done once and for all.

00:13:30.193 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:90%
It can be complete.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.107 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Oh, yeah.

00:13:32.107 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It can be completely be a
life-changing experience

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:90%
in an hour and a half.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And we see this all the time.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, people have
a visceral experience

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.557 align:middle line:90%
of others in the room.

00:13:41.557 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:90%
And hear each other breathing.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're supporting
each other in the practice.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:90%
So we just we just witness.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:84%
We bear witness
to the experience,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
kind of be like referees,
make sure everything

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:90%
is in the right place.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.982 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right, exactly.

00:13:54.982 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with us
some of the stories

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:84%
of more profound healing that
has come from the breath work

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:90%
sessions?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Oh, one
of our musicians, he

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.210 align:middle line:84%
was coming as a breath
work practitioner

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:90%
before he was our musician.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was in a
severe car accident

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:90%
and had major back pain.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.230 align:middle line:90%
He no longer has back pain.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that tension
was, that gripping that he

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:90%
had in his back, was released.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:84%
This was a situation with
cannabis and breath work.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:84%
But somebody's arm was so tight
from rheumatoid arthritis they

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:90%
couldn't open their arm fully.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And one day, over a series
of several private sessions,

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
that room started to
shake out and release,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and his rheumatoid arthritis
went into remission.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So severe PTSD is something
that we see pretty regularly,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:90%
help heal.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's been an amazing process
to hold space for, for sure.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.325 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now you also
work with cannabis.

00:15:01.325 --> 00:15:02.125 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: We do.

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And can you share
with us how you first

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
came to recognize the
relationship between cannabis

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
being used to help heal trauma
and its psychedelic therapy?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah, for sure.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so Colorado had just
legalized cannabis end of 2012.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And so in 2013, a
friend of mine suggested

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that I consider working with
cannabis as a psychedelic.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never really
considered it before then.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Like I'd used cannabis
intentionally in that way.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But I never thought it would
be as powerful as a tool.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But I've training in
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I have training in psilocybin
guide training, guide work.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I had all
these modalities

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
that were used in
conjunction with a medicine.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So we just used all
of those modalities

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and created a protocol
and used cannabis instead.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:90%
And it worked really well.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine who was
one of my first guinea pigs

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:84%
jokingly said, if I didn't
know you and trust you,

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought
you put DMT In that.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that was one of
the first real awarenesses

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that we had that
something different was

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:90%
happening than we expected.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would be, maybe, a
basic healing, like a training

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.940 align:middle line:90%
tool, because it was legal.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:90%
We could teach with it.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:90%
We could use it.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out
to be as potentially

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
powerful as these other
classic psychedelics.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And what is the protocol
for using cannabis in this way?

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: We start
with good medicine.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
We use organic
medicine, high quality,

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:90%
potent, clean medicine.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And we blend different
strains together

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
to create these what
I call a full spectrum

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic experience.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same setup as a
one-on-one breath work session,

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
but instead of doing
the big breath work,

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.060 align:middle line:84%
when it's time to
begin the journey,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I invite somebody to use
a vaporizer so that it's

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:90%
clean and healthy on the lungs.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And they take as
much as they feel

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:84%
is appropriate for their
tolerance and where they're at.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And they can always
take more if they wish.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we either
have a conversation

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:90%
where we're checking in.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
And it's more of an
MDMA-assisted therapy session.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Or they're invited to lay
down with an eye covering,

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:90%
like the video you just saw.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
And they go inward, more
like a psilocybin session.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Again, play music.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not as evocative,
but it's kind

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of across the board to
help facilitate the journey

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:90%
experience for them.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And then at times,
I'll check in.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
They're invited to
share their experience.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And those are more of
like a guided meditation

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:84%
to help them stay
with their process.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes they're
quiet the whole time,

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:90%
and we chat about it afterwards.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how is this
cannabis-assisted psychedelic

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:84%
therapy different
from recreational use?

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.663 align:middle line:84%
Just if we can tie that
together for our viewers,

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:90%
I think it would be helpful.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Sure.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, recreational
use is often among friends

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:84%
or go to a movie, there's
maybe art or music's involved.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:90%
It's playful.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:90%
It's creative.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes the bad,
or the negative side,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of recreational use would be to
use to escape tension or pain,

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:90%
like any drug could be used.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But this is to help us
turn inward and turn

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
towards our struggles and
turn towards our difficulties.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually the
opposite of recreational use.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's an invitation to go
inward and be quiet, so there's

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:90%
no need to have conversation.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So usually general things
like social anxiety

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that come up with cannabis use
don't show up in these spaces.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very intentional,
contained environment.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Even smoking is
done with intention.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not just giving them
medicine and telling them,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, just take this.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
We say a prayer or sit in
meditation as people smoke.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're really working
with the opposite

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:84%
of what you'd call a
stereotypical pot smoker.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you're trying
to create a sacred space.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Always
create a sacred space.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Where something
conscious and intentional

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
can be revealed as a
byproduct of your approach

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:90%
to the whole thing.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:90%
To me, this work is sacred.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So we acknowledge and honor the
spirit of the plant as an ally.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's there to help us.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It's there to bring
us back to ourselves.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when we treat it
as that, it provides that.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The biggest benefit of
using cannabis in this way,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.820 align:middle line:90%
what would you say?

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Oh, 90% of my work
is trauma resolution work.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So I would say most mental
health concerns stem

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:90%
from struggles in our past.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And we clear that
out of our bodies.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We just create space to become
more of who we already are.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what
types, specifically,

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:84%
of psychological
conditions do you

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:84%
feel are the most affected
by psychedelic therapy?

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Any anxiety
disorders is something

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can work
with in this space.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And also depression is
very common in our society.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:90%
So those are the two big ones.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Obsessive compulsive disorders
and neuroses is something

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:90%
that I work with quite a bit.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And so again, giving ourselves
an opportunity to reset,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:84%
re-evaluate, and break free from
that neurological patterning

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that pulls us into those cycles
that don't work for us anymore.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And then over time,
even personality traits

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:84%
shift towards healthier
ways of being.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:90%
But things like that take time.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: How does this
play out relative

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:90%
to traditional psychotherapy?

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: It's like a
compliment in a lot of ways.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So the preparation
and integration

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
could be considered
traditional psychotherapy.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We pay attention to
their mental state.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:90%
But the experiences themselves--

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle line:84%
especially I've seen this
with my personal clients,

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
people who have mindfulness
practices already,

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:84%
are already in therapy,
they can take it really deep

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:90%
because they're primed for it.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But if they didn't have
the medicine experience,

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:84%
they may not ever
be able to take it

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to that place because of
just some innate stuckness

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.165 align:middle line:84%
or a defense mechanism
that is hard to clear.

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It softens the wall.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Softens
all the ego structures

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:90%
so that they can look at things.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.482 align:middle line:84%
But also, it doesn't
just soften their ego.

00:21:30.482 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't just break this down.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It provides psychological,
emotional, almost nourishing

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.560 align:middle line:84%
support in the
experience itself.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So people feel very safe
when they're looking at it.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not just scary.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It's scary, but I'm
safe and I'm held here.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.955 align:middle line:84%
And so and so then they
take that realization

00:21:47.955 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:84%
or that understanding,
and they bring it back

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:84%
into their traditional
psychotherapy practice,

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
they're in a different
place altogether.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So I work with a lot
of psychotherapists.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.080 align:middle line:90%
They'll send me their clients.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll work with them for a
few sessions or short series,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:90%
and then they go back.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I see them a
year later or something.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And how does this compare
to other psychedelic therapies?

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Cannabis can act
like all the other psychedelics,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:84%
so one session can be
just like an MDMA session.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Another one with another person
will be just like a psilocybin

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.957 align:middle line:90%
mushroom session.

00:22:19.957 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we're even
approaching levels

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:84%
that are like ayahuasca
and DMT level.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So working with
cannabis, you kind of

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.820 align:middle line:84%
have to know how to work with
all the different medicines

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:84%
because it shows up just
the way somebody needs it.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Cannabis is special in that way.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And then also, specifically,
it's very somatically oriented,

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:84%
where some of these
other medicines

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:84%
are more dissociative,
or they're

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.873 align:middle line:84%
in another space or
another reality, even.

00:22:46.873 --> 00:22:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Another difference between
cannabis and other psychedelics

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.595 align:middle line:84%
is people don't lose
their sense of agency.

00:22:51.595 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean they stay
in control of the experience,

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:90%
but they're able to engage it.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're a
partner in the experience,

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
whereas these other medicines,
they just kind of pull you

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a choice.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:90%
You go where you go.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interesting.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.203 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: So I like working
with cannabis for that reason.

00:23:10.203 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So can you walk
us through what happens

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.670 align:middle line:90%
in a conscious cannabis event?

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Sure.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of our work
is at the yoga studio.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:90%
We work with groups.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So we call them conscious
cannabis circles.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is
sitting in a circle.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:84%
they're on yoga mats
or some sort of pad.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.540 align:middle line:90%
We give an introduction.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We talk about
intention and safety.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I call it the flight attendant
talk, where you're just like,

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:84%
here's how you do it and
here's where to stay.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we imbibe the
medicine in ceremony.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's acknowledging
the earth and the sky

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and just taking the medicine
with intention and meditation,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:90%
prayer.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:84%
People are invited,
then, to lay down.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:84%
They're in Savasana, so in
a really open, gentle space.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I guide them through
a body scan meditation,

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:84%
so guide the whole
group in a body scan.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
helps with the jitters

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.520 align:middle line:84%
as the medicine's
coming on, and they just

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.160 align:middle line:84%
keep sinking deeper and
deeper into an internal space.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And then I play music.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.883 align:middle line:84%
I play music and just
keep an eye on everybody.

00:24:12.883 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody needs
anything, they just

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:90%
know to raise their hand.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of our sitters or
I'll be right there with them,

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:90%
support them.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a break in the middle.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:90%
And then we do it again.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:90%
There's a second set.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
At the end, there's an
invitation to share.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We have snacks and
juice and chocolate.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We really like to treat people
after these experiences.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And then people share
their experience,

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.022 align:middle line:90%
and they're witnessed and held.

00:24:37.022 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, they
share really big stuff

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and life-transforming things,
and so we hold space for that.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody is required
to have a designated driver,

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and they go home
for the evening.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
We give them some tips on how
to integrate the experience.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Excellent.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: And just keep going.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.872 align:middle line:84%
You took part in Gaia's
series, "Psychedelica".

00:24:58.872 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: I did, yeah.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And we have an
excerpt from that in one

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:90%
of your cannabis circles.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.618 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look at this.

00:25:04.618 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Daniel McQueen founded
Medicinal Mindfulness,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.720 align:middle line:84%
which specializes in the
spiritual and therapeutic

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
application of psychedelics
or breathing techniques

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:90%
in the Boulder, Colorado area.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> In regards to
setting with cannabis,

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.430 align:middle line:84%
we bring in a gratitude prayer
when we imbibe the medicine.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And we sit in a
circle, and we're

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:84%
calling in energies and
ways of being that support

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic journey work.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is far from--

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
like the exact opposite
extreme of recreational use

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
or unconscious use
or habitual use.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We're not just sitting there
feeling stoned or blissed out,

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that there's some real
significant psychological,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, and
energetically healing

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and life-transforming
occurrences happening

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:90%
in the psyche and in the body.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And we turn towards
those experiences

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.120 align:middle line:84%
instead of using the
medicine to check out

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:90%
from those experiences.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> By creating a
healing intention,

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:84%
or a safe space to enter
deeply mystical realms,

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.140 align:middle line:84%
circles such as these are
dismantling the negative

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
stereotypes and calling in a
revival of ancient ceremonial

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:90%
use of this plant.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:22.960 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.905 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is a
psychedelic cannabis blend?

00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Well, you know,
so there's no such thing

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.220 align:middle line:90%
as a singular cannabis plant.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:84%
There's different
what's called strains,

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's different
families of strains.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:84%
On one side, there's
sativas, which are elevating,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:90%
creative, energetic.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.530 align:middle line:90%
They can also create anxiety.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side,
there's what's called indicas.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're very body-oriented.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So people deeply relax.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're used
to help them sleep.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But they can be kind
of numbing, you know?

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Like you can kind of
check out in that space

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
or go to sleep or
feel kind of dull.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's deeply
physically relaxing.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a third of strains

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:84%
called hybrids, which
are very heart opening.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:90%
They're hybrids.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:84%
They're in between
indicas and sativas.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So they're elevated,
but not too much.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:84%
You can feel them in your
body, but you're not droopy.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we
combine these strains.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And they smell different, and
it's the terpene structures.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- I'm assuming
you know a little bit,

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:90%
like, essential oil therapies.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, like
lavender is calming.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.630 align:middle line:84%
That chemical is
found in indicas.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The chemical that
elevates the mood,

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.780 align:middle line:84%
like lemon smells
or pine smells,

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
are found in the strains
that are elevating.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're combining all
of these terpens together

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
that create this really
advanced entourage effect.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So you get all of the
benefits of the sativas,

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety drops away
because your body's so relaxed.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And you get all this deep
relaxation from the indica,

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
but you're still
alert and awake.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.270 align:middle line:90%
You're not sleepy or droopy.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an elevated, hyper
alert, but deeply relaxed

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
space with the hybrids
opening up heart space.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And so there feels like a
lot of psychological support

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:90%
and nourishment.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And within that,
the body shakes.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
A lot of shaking
happens, or trembling.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I just did a session yesterday
where it was mostly that work.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So deep tensions
are released out

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:84%
of the body because
of the indicas.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But the sativas are creating
inner visual experiences,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:90%
so people are seeing memories.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They're re-experiencing things
that are important to them

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But they also might be
traveling through what

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
would be like a
kaleidoscope of color,

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:84%
flying through the universe,
meeting allies and guides,

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.370 align:middle line:84%
things that are
typically stereotypical

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:90%
of a real psychedelic trip.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the primary difference
with working with cannabis

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.200 align:middle line:84%
is they can take their eye
covering off and be right back,

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and then put it right
back on when they're ready

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:90%
and go right back into it.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And that can't
really happen with

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:90%
other psychedelic medicines.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:84%
You're either in the
experience or you're not.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Very interesting.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
We have Skye Weaver about
to join us on Skype.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.940 align:middle line:84%
She is one of the many people
who've benefited greatly

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:90%
from Daniel's work.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Skye.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
here with us today.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us how you came
to find Daniel and the Center

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:90%
for Medicinal Mindfulness?

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SKYE WEAVER: Yes.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I was on the
medicine path and had

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:84%
worked with a really big
medicine called 5-MeO-DMT.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for
some integration tools.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I had been inspired
by that medicine

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:84%
to really dive into
integration as my offering,

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.790 align:middle line:84%
as what I could hold to
help support people prepare

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:59.050 align:middle line:84%
for and navigate and integrate
psychedelic experiences.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to two of
the integration leaders

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in the LA area, and
they recommended

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Daniel to come and train
with Daniel, and also

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:90%
at the Hakomi Institute.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So I just dove into
this work with Daniel,

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:84%
thinking that it was just going
to be just cannabis, like we

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:90%
joke around.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But it opened up a
whole world for me

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:90%
that really changed my life.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Specifically, what issues
were you hoping to resolve?

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WEAVER: I had had a
pretty traumatic experience

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:84%
the first time that I had done
that, the 5-MeO medicine, so

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%
hoping to heal some
trauma around that.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:31:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So a not great relationship
with the facilitator.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So really getting
in touch with what

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
it would be for me to
be in integrity, for me

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.560 align:middle line:84%
to be a person who
can walk this path

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and be of service
to people, like

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:84%
who I needed to be in
order to hold space

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.120 align:middle line:90%
for people in this work.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
through Daniel's work.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What were some of
your first experiences

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:90%
within Daniel's work?

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WEAVER: My first experience
that I had where I was like,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.030 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's something
really big here.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.390 align:middle line:90%
We were in our first training.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the
psychedelic sitter school

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
that Daniel teaches, teaching
people how to hold space

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.180 align:middle line:90%
for this cannabis work.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was facilitating
for a woman,

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and we were all sitting, holding
space in the space with her.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And I had my eyes closed.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down and I
could see my chakra system.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I looked up, eyes
closed again, and I

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:84%
could see the energy of me
and all the other people

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:84%
in the circle who were
all focused on her,

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and then our energy that kind
of came together above and below

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and created this sphere of light
that felt like we were just

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.600 align:middle line:84%
traveling through the infinite
darkness of the cosmos

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.200 align:middle line:84%
in this bubble of light,
holding, literally

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:84%
holding and creating the
container for her healing.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Really, really profound.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank you, Skye.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I would love for you,
if you don't mind, just

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:84%
sharing with us
what the trauma was

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:90%
that you were trying to heal.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I want to ask
is that many of our viewers

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
have many traumas
that are pocketed away

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
that are impacting
their lives right now.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And if we can share
some of the things

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have
transcended, it makes

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.440 align:middle line:84%
it easier for everyone to
recognize that they, too,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.180 align:middle line:90%
can do the same.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Would it be possible for you to
share the trauma specifically?

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WEAVER: There have been a
lot of experiences in my life

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:84%
where my body was
used as someone's

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:84%
outlet for their anger
or their frustration.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And through this
work, I unlocked

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
that I had an
experience where someone

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:84%
had grabbed my shoulders
and shook me in my face.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And it felt at that
moment, through this work--

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even
remember this memory--

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:84%
but through this work,
this memory with uncovered,

00:33:52.950 --> 00:34:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and I felt my wings being
broken, my shoulders, my wings.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And this medicine
revealed that to me.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200 align:middle line:84%
The cannabis worked
specifically.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I had an experience
at the next training,

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:84%
the facilitators training, guide
training that Daniel teaches,

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.699 align:middle line:84%
where we were trading
off sitting and guiding

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:26.900 align:middle line:90%
for each other.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And my body became
encapsulated into the earth.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I was one with the earth,
like roots and moss

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.969 align:middle line:90%
had grown over me.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.389 align:middle line:84%
And from within
the earth, I could

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:47.900 align:middle line:84%
feel these roots or
these tendrils of energy

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that came up into my
spine, in through my spine,

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
into my energy points,
into my chakra system.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I'd had some chronic
pain in my back,

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and just this like
tightness in my body.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And I could literally feel the
medicine rearranging my spinal

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:84%
column and hearing
it pop and crack .

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as my
spine realigned,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:84%
all of sudden my body
just started to move,

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and it literally felt
like unwinding, rewinding

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:84%
the trauma and the tension in my
body, in my connective tissues,

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:90%
in my fascia.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:35.790 align:middle line:84%
My body-- as I surrendered,
my body moved itself.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And through this medicine,
I've found my wings again.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm more open.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:45.840 align:middle line:90%
heart's more open.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to be more vulnerable,
to show up in my power,

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.440 align:middle line:90%
to be willing to be seen.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so would you say
that that is the greatest

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.000 align:middle line:84%
takeaway from this
work, is that you're

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.028 align:middle line:84%
able to reveal as the
true self in a way

00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:90%
that you were unable to before?

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Or is there anything
else that you

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:12.960 align:middle line:84%
would like to share about your
greatest understanding of what

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.420 align:middle line:90%
has transpired here?

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WEAVER: Yeah.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I'd say this concept of
the somatic psychedelic.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
My theory is that the cannabis
works on the nervous system.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it really helps to
unlock anything that's stuck.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.270 align:middle line:84%
As a body worker and an
energy worker as well,

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and a yoga teacher and
a cannabis facilitator,

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:46.380 align:middle line:84%
this medicine has really
unlocked my body, my soma.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And through that
experience, it's

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:84%
really been both an inside
out and an outside in healing.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, to be able to
heal my internal traumas

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and my lineage, my
story, my family

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:12.000 align:middle line:84%
traumas, the generational
traumas, to be able to, yes,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.170 align:middle line:84%
show up in my own power so that
I can show up for my family

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and be the medicine
for the family,

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:84%
for the tribe, for all of
those who I can show up for,

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
has really empowered
me to be myself

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.610 align:middle line:84%
so that I can show for others
to be able to do the same.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wonderful.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Skye,
for sharing your story

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and your process with us.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that it would be
helpful for many, many people.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.857 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being with
us on "The Healing Matrix".

00:37:38.857 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WEAVER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Blessings to you.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So Daniel, what do you do
to help people integrate

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:84%
their experiences
from the circle

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.283 align:middle line:84%
when they move out
into their lives?

00:37:50.283 --> 00:37:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: We just create
a lot of community support

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:54.010 align:middle line:90%
around the experience.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So some people come
see me one on one work.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And then other people, we
do group conversations.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:84%
We have video conference
calls for people who are out

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:90%
of the country or out of state.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So just a lot of
conversations and support.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So people will bring
the idea that they

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.340 align:middle line:84%
gained from the experience
and try to implement it

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.140 align:middle line:90%
into their lives.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.682 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to learn from
that, whether it's successful

00:38:18.682 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we help people implement
those ideas into their lives,

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and also help with
the consequences,

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.240 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, of what they
remember or what they realize

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.770 align:middle line:84%
about themselves, just help them
process it and work through it,

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and coach people in having
conversations with the people

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.460 align:middle line:84%
they need to have
conversations with.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is
that the healing ripples

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.370 align:middle line:84%
through family systems and it
ripples through communities.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And it can be a little
edgy, so we sometimes

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:84%
do mediation between
communities and people as well.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:90%
So we provide a lot of support.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.770 align:middle line:84%
My wife is an art therapist,
so she does a lot of art

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.600 align:middle line:90%
with the people she works with.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
way that people help

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.265 align:middle line:90%
integrate these experiences.

00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Just so that our viewers
have an understanding of what's

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:13.520 align:middle line:84%
going on, what is this, can you
describe what is DMT for us?

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Dimethyltryptamine
is a plant medicine

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that's in thousands and
thousands of different plants.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's extracted
and made into brews.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So ayahuasca is something
that people are familiar with.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be
extracted and smoked.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very
intense experience.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Unlike the other medicines
where you may feel like yourself

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.270 align:middle line:84%
or like you're still
here, DMT can propel you

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.330 align:middle line:84%
into a space that
feels wholly other,

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:48.945 align:middle line:84%
like an alien landscape, no
sense of identity anymore.

00:39:48.945 --> 00:39:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Hyper colorful, hyper
visual, and what

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:56.170 align:middle line:84%
almost appears to be like
a higher dimensional space,

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:84%
so you see things
morphing and transforming.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a
deep intelligence

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:84%
that's present in that space
that feels bigger than us

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.320 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So people have
mystical experiences.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.400 align:middle line:84%
They can connect with
entities and allies.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Or they're just in a field of
unity consciousness, oneness.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.998 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very foreign
experience for most people.

00:40:18.998 --> 00:40:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The Gaia
series "Psychedelica"

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.880 align:middle line:84%
explored DMT in one
of the episodes.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So what exactly are
Dimethyltryptamine's effects

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:28.880 align:middle line:90%
on consciousness?

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It begins very quickly.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.110 align:middle line:84%
You begin to feel different
within a heartbeat or two

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:36.590 align:middle line:84%
after the completion
of the injection.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a feeling
of acceleration

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and inner psychic tension
that begins and builds quite

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.980 align:middle line:90%
rapidly, almost overwhelmingly.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.400 align:middle line:84%
The visual image of the room,
if you had your eyes open,

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:54.740 align:middle line:84%
would start to break up in a
pixelation kind of pattern.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:84%
If your eyes were
closed at that stage,

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
it's a display of
kaleidoscopic images.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Also during that time is a
high-pitched kind of sound,

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.110 align:middle line:90%
usually high-pitch.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Could be oscillating wah
wah wah kind of sound.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Might be some crinkling
kinds of sounds.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's increasing
in intensity.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's crescendoing,
which kind of

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:26.820 align:middle line:84%
parallels the anxiety or
the feeling of stimulation.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
break out of your body.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the internal pressure
just can't be held in the body

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.870 align:middle line:84%
anymore, and your
consciousness breaks loose.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of the plateau
between your two minutes

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:40.940 align:middle line:90%
and seven minutes or so.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you start coming down,
and things slowly recongeal.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.655 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do you agree with
this description of the DMT?

00:41:50.655 --> 00:41:51.455 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:41:51.455 --> 00:41:52.620 align:middle line:90%
I'd go even further.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Like you see a kaleidoscope,
but become the unfolding

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.210 align:middle line:90%
kaleidoscope.

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Something Dr. Strassman
also describes it

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.700 align:middle line:84%
as is we have this saying
called it's more real than real,

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.110 align:middle line:84%
so the experience itself feels
more real than this reality.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it's hard to
describe that to someone,

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:84%
but that's very common
in people's experiences.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like think of it as
like getting in a Star Trek

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.310 align:middle line:84%
transporter, and everything
kind of glittering out,

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and then you're just in a
completely different space,

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.120 align:middle line:84%
or you see a tunnel that you
go through or flying through,

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.990 align:middle line:84%
a constantly unfolding
tunnel that takes you

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.652 align:middle line:90%
to another place completely.

00:42:30.652 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you're hoping
to expand consciousness

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:35.910 align:middle line:84%
so that we can integrate,
interpret it, and bring it

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:39.720 align:middle line:84%
into our culture more
effectively, this greater

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.520 align:middle line:90%
wisdom.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics have a
strong track record

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:90%
for bringing in new technology.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Our understanding
of DNA is connected

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.535 align:middle line:90%
with people using LSD.

00:42:50.535 --> 00:42:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:84%
The iPhone, the inspiration
of the iPhone was on LSD.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
technology that's

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.663 align:middle line:84%
been developed in conjunction
with the use of psychedelics.

00:43:02.663 --> 00:43:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So we're just
trying to figure out

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.040 align:middle line:84%
how to create a protocol around
advanced creative problem

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.290 align:middle line:90%
solving with it.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Very interesting.

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So how can people find
out more about your work?

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: We have a website,
medicinalmindfulness.org.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.780 align:middle line:84%
All of our events
are on there, and how

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to start working
with us as a client.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have
another website called

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.882 align:middle line:90%
psychedelicsittersschool.org.

00:43:28.882 --> 00:43:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's if people are
interested in learning

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.080 align:middle line:84%
how to hold space for
others, friends and family,

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually
as a professional.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So we teach people
how to do this work,

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and we also are
practitioners ourselves.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fantastic.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Daniel, for being here

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and sharing your wisdom,
your understanding,

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.132 align:middle line:84%
and your compassion for
humanity with us today.

00:43:51.132 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCQUEEN: Well,
thank you so much.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a pleasure
speaking with you today.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.522 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Absolutely.

00:43:57.522 --> 00:43:59.980 align:middle line:84%
There is much promise in the
work of psychedelic therapists

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.650 align:middle line:84%
like Daniel McQueen who are
on the cutting edge of healing

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:03.520 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:84%
For some of us suffering from
serious psychological concerns,

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.980 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic therapy may
be just the protocol

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that brings profound personal
growth and much needed relief.

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us on "Healing Matrix".

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:22.000 align:middle line:90%
