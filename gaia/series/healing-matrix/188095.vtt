>>SUE MORTER: Is it
possible to heal yourself

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:10%
from an illness so debilitating
that Western medicine has

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:10%
completely given up
on your treatment?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:10%
That was the case
with Donna Eden.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
When she was young, Donna was
afflicted with tuberculosis,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
MS, neuropathy, and many
autoimmune symptoms,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and she was given no option
for recovery by doctors.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
That's when she
took it upon herself

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to heal her body
with her own energy.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
She now leads thousands of
others to heal themselves

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and to teach her techniques
around the world.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for being
here with us today, Donna.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:90%
It's so amazing to have you.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so thrilled to
talk about the topics

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:90%
that you talk about.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It is very near and dear
to my heart and my soul,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and I look forward
to digging into what

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:90%
we get to share today.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DONNA EDEN: Thank you.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm really glad to be here, too.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Absolutely.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about you and
how this started for you.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I know that it was a personal
experience for you that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:84%
brought you right into this
aspect of life and living

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:90%
So tell us your story.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:10%
>>EDEN: Well, when I was 16,
my legs started giving out.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And nobody diagnosed it at that
time until I was in my 20's.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was getting
worse and worse.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was also
going into asthma.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And I was--

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't eat foods that
were good for everybody else.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't eat things that
grew out of the ground.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:10%
I could not metabolize them.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I was
27, I had a heart attack.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I was trying
to find specialists

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
because I was getting more
and more, not walking at all.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had five
different specialists

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:90%
say that I wasn't going to--

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going to make it.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And that one told me to
get my affairs in order

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and find somebody to raise
my kids if I didn't want

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:90%
my husband to pick somebody.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
But that day, it
was very strange.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
It was-- I felt like
lightning hit me,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:90%
and that, oh, I'm going to heal.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I knew it in an instant I
was going to heal myself.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.023 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So they're telling
you there's no way out.

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: There is no way out.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And in that same instant,
you are having a revelation.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Something's happening for you.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: I knew I was
going to heal myself.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I went home and I just
started experimenting.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And the first
experiment was just

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
putting one hand on my thigh
and one hand over my knee

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and just holding them, and
it took about three minutes

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:84%
before I could feel and see that
the energy was connecting up.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was over my
thighs and my quadriceps

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
that nothing was
happening anymore.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:90%
There was no energy movement.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't walk, I couldn't
climb a step or anything.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, I
could see, I could

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:90%
feel that was connecting up.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you didn't
know about energy flow

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
or you weren't educated
in that moment,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.750 align:middle line:84%
but you were just kind of
feeling your way into that?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: I wasn't educated in it,
but I had always known energy.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I just, it never
occurred to me to--

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't use it to heal.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I think all my life I could feel
the circuits when they were off

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:90%
or when they were on.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you're
laying on the couch,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:84%
you connect these circuits, you
feel energy moving, and then--

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:90%
then what happened after that?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Very next thing that
happened, I mean, I would--

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, energy on our
hands is electromagnetic,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and the energies in our
body is electromagnetic.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that
wherever I touched it,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
something would happen.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And so that I could
move the energy,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I could maybe release it where
there was too much energy

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:90%
someplace, I could--

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the body already
knows how to heal.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was really
getting in touch with.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.112 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I'm sorry,
how old were you?

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: I was in my late 20s.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: 20s.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So you're like, you're
processing this, like for real.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming
together for you.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: And it was
exciting and thrilling.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And I did not get depressed
because I was on a journey.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- and I didn't
believe the doctors.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I just thought they didn't know.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And Western medicine at that
time, and I think even now,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
is quick to admit that
autoimmune illnesses,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:90%
they don't have skills for.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
They can maybe stop
something with a medication,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
but they really can't heal
an autoimmune illness.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And an autoimmune illness is
really made for energy medicine

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's the energy
has turned against you.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So you've just got to turn
that energy back around.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We have to
develop self-love

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:84%
in a way that allows us to
be in an ownership position

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to use this energy as
it was meant to be used.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be
following our consciousness,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.865 align:middle line:84%
but if our consciousness is
freaked out because we're

00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
getting these
kinds of diagnoses,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that hey, your
days are numbered,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
go home and get your
affairs in order, you know,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of hard to focus up.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
But in my clinic, I recognize
that there were people

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
who were given prognoses like
this, and they would come in

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and we would have a conversation
like this, and 20 years later,

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:84%
30 years later, they were
bringing their grandkids by

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:90%
to show me how life turned out.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And this, this is what
we want people to know.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We want people to know
there's an alternative.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:84%
In that situation
with you, how long

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
did it take that healing
to really unfold?

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: As you
said, in increments.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
found out is that I

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
had been allergic to wheat
and grains all my life.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I was eating
my first sandwich.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.315 align:middle line:84%
I never was able to eat a
sandwich without getting very--

00:06:13.315 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Your circuits
were connecting.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yes.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Your system was working.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:90%
You're eating a sandwich.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: I'm eating a sandwich.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And it was just thrilling.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
it was vegetables

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:90%
I could suddenly eat.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
But before when I was sick,
I could only eat red meat.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard for
people to grasp,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
but I believe it was because
it was such a thick protein.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And my body needed--

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Slow release
into the system.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Yes A slow
release into the system.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So it took much longer for
fruit, to be able to eat fruit.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: High vibration, sends
out cleansing too much,

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
your system overreacts.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: So my body
was telling me

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
all along the way
what was working.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And I would really
stay with that

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.857 align:middle line:90%
until that was a bit perfected.

00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You were listening.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: I was listening.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:90%
I was listening.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And in our culture, nobody
was taught how to listen.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when people say, well,
just listen to your body,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:84%
nobody's been taught
how to listen.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I am sure our ancestors had
to listen in order to survive.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're all here today
because they listened.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got
healing in our DNA.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And we've got healing.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Again, our body
knows how to do this.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to get in touch
because we live in a world we

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:90%
didn't evolve to live in.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
The world we evolved
for was natural.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it was much easier
to be in sync and to hear.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, every square
inch of our atmosphere

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
is filled with man-made
electromagnetic energies.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And we have additives in
our food, and we have--

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our food is
packaged in plastic.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, that's
not going to go away.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
We have got to learn
how to be in this world.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And so what energy medicine
does is teaches you

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
how to be here in this world and
not let those energies totally

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.088 align:middle line:90%
overwhelm our systems.

00:08:22.088 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I look at it like
we've set up quite an obstacle

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
course for ourselves to
cause evolution consciously.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:90%
We have to make choices.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:90%
We have to decide.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
We have to pick
and choose and use

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
our awareness, or intelligence
in a way that is serving this.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have to connect
like what you have done.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, what we're
doing is teaching people

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
how to connect into our
system and get these energy

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
systems working properly
and talking to each other,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and allowing our whole
body to operate the way

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:90%
it was designed to operate.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: The way it was designed.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:90%
We were designed this way.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very wonderful to
reclaim our healing abilities,

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.097 align:middle line:84%
and that our body is
on our side, and--

00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's all one thing.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:09.725 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: It's all one thing.

00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now I know you work with
several systems in particular.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:90%
You break it down.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The whole energy system
of the body is massive,

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're breaking it down
into various aspects of study.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you share this with us?

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: We teach, in our
program, nine major energy

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So the meridians that
flow through your body

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and govern your organs, with
the chakra system that is, yeah,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:90%
they're like energy stations.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And they have seven
layers on each chakra,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and what you get at
each level is different.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can go way
back and retrieve memories.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.375 align:middle line:84%
And we work with the
radiant circuits, which is--

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, people are so
stressed out in our culture.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And so there is an
energy system that

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't have the priority
because we are still governed

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
by that fight or flight
or freeze response

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:90%
from millions of years ago.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:84%
We have not changed
how we react to stress.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But underneath that system
of fight, flight, or freeze

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:84%
is the radiant
circuits, which people

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
have a lot more joy
in them that they

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:90%
aren't often able to access.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So we teach how to
connect those circuitries

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
of the radiant circuits.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That's like that
unifying presence, that

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
oneness energy that is holding
the space for all the rest

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:90%
of this stuff to take place.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: That's exactly right.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And when we drop in
on it with our awareness,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
it has an opportunity to
become more robust, which

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
allows our natural healing
ability to be recognized again

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.538 align:middle line:90%
and come forward.

00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you work with
some others as well.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.413 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Let me just say
one more thing about the--

00:11:02.413 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you just said what you
said about the radiant circuits

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
just about your joy,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's about being able to
drop very deep into your body.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:90%
It helps for that.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Whatever psychic awareness
you have, it can turn that on.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Your intuition.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
can be turned on

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:90%
with the radiant circuits.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So the fight, flight,
or freeze response

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
is mostly governed
by triple warmer.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It is a meridian, but it
is also a radiant circuit.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It is pervasive in your body
because immediately when

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.242 align:middle line:90%
stress turns on, it turns on.

00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Blood leaves your forebrain to
go into your body for the fight

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
or flight response, and you
don't have all your marbles

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
up in your head anymore to
be able to think it through.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we
do in our culture,

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
we try to think it through,
and you know, it doesn't work.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So that one is a
powerful one that I

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:84%
feel we really need to evolve
at this time in our culture.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We have to because that's
why people are getting

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
so many autoimmune illnesses,
and cancers, and everything,

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.620 align:middle line:84%
because those stress responses
and stress chemicals,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:84%
stress hormones just
flood our bodies.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And it not only gets
you well and healthy, it

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
makes life so wonderful when
that is not there pervasively.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, it's
like we don't know

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
who we are unless
we're fighting a fight

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:90%
or struggling over something.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And really, if we
want to be preventive,

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
we have to be operating
as this creative essence,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:90%
this pure presence.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And the more we land our
consciousness on that,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.075 align:middle line:84%
the more it settles the
system automatically

00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have to go
chasing all the symptoms.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Right.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:90%
That was said beautifully.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's so fun
to talk with you.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm having such a fabulous time.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that we have a guest
on the show that is someone

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
that you've done work
with, that you've

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:84%
shared your healing principles
and practices with her.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
She's had a healing
story of her own.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to bring her in.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.603 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: OK, wonderful.

00:13:09.603 --> 00:13:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And I look
forward to this.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to speak
with Dianne Faure.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.127 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dianne.

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DIANNE FAURE: Thank you.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor to be here.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So tell us your story.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about how you've

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:90%
come to be where you are.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:10%
>>DIANNE FAURE: Well,
as a young adult,

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:10%
I suffered from
chronic back pain

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:10%
and IBS and TMJ and allergies.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:10%
And I just sort
of lived with it,

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:10%
and it became chronically
worse over time.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I ended up having three
children and with the birth

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:84%
of each of my
children, my back pain

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:90%
became progressively worse.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:84%
I happen to be
married to a doctor,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
so I would just sort of
pick up whatever he had been

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:90%
seeing in the office that day.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was having chronic
colds or sinusitis,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I was always on one medication
or off a medication.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And this just sort of
became a way of life for me.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
After the birth
of my third child,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I was unable to actually
physically walk.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I had to manually move
my leg to go forward.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up
having back surgery.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And after the
surgery, I could walk,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
but I had excruciating pain
down the sides of my legs

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and no one could
tell me what it was.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So I did PT for a year, water
therapy, nothing was working.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I did research
and discovered about 90%

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:84%
of people with back
pain benefit from yoga.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing yoga,
which allowed me then

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:90%
to really lead a normal life.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I was prior to that time
pushing a baby carriage

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:90%
and walking with a cane.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.593 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to sort of
live a somewhat normal life.

00:14:50.593 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I was one of these people that
would carry a pillow around

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
with them and I had a little
box of all my medications

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:90%
whenever I traveled.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I managed to
sort of hobble along,

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:90%
and then I hit menopause.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I hit menopause,
everything just sort of

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:90%
exploded.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And I developed hypothyroidism,
my hair was falling out

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.932 align:middle line:84%
in gobs, I was having chronic
insomnia to the point where

00:15:15.932 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I would be afraid to
go to sleep at night

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know how
long that was going to take.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I was up all night.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I was putting
my foot out on the floor

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, I'd
have shooting pain

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:90%
throughout all my joints.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And that really got my attention
because I was like, wow,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm 53 years old, what am
I going to be at 63 or 73?

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:90%
So I was really concerned.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So you--

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I am just amazed at
the number of things

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that started unfolding for
you in a not so pleasant way.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And you're an attorney, right?

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Were you able to work?

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Were you able to
go and practice?

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FAURE: So once
my children grew up

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to get back
into the practice full-time

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:84%
of law again, but I was unable
to really even walk up stairs.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And I developed what looked
to be rheumatoid arthritis.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I started to develop chronic
allergies to any medications.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to break out in
what looked like skin lupus.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I really was
looking for something

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that I could do to
myself, I wouldn't

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
need to go get fixed by someone,
and something that would allow

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:84%
me to live a normal life and
not just get worse as I age,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:90%
but actually vibrant as I age.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking on
YouTube for a yoga video

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
when I came across, somehow,
Donna's video popped up.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking, watching
her, and I didn't understand

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
a word she was talking about,
but she had all this energy

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
any energy at all.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:90%
So I was really impressed.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I was so desperate to try to get
rid of these issues that I had,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.213 align:middle line:84%
I went on her website
and discovered

00:16:56.213 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:84%
that she was talking in New
Jersey the next weekend.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So I said to my husband, I'm
like, we're getting in the car,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going to New Jersey,
I need to see this woman.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
So by the end of that weekend,
I found out the first thing

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
that I could do to try
to help my back pain.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
So within a couple
days, I was pain free.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:90%
And that really impressed me.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So then I decided, I
need to keep going.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
So I went down to Phoenix
for the next couple years--

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
and I never had any intention
of becoming a practitioner.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I was on what was called the
wellness track at that time.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to get better.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up going through
that program with Donna.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And every situation, even
my hypothyroidism, resolved.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
My RA, Rheumatoid
Arthritis, and my lupus

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:84%
still shows up in my blood, but
I have no symptoms whatsoever.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
All my other issues resolved,
and I was just amazed.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I was just so amazed that I
ended up going back to work.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
I practiced law for
another couple years.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided that
this work was so important

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and people needed
to know about this.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.535 align:middle line:84%
And so my husband,
the doctor, would say,

00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've got this
patient, we've tried everything,

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
we've done all the
tests and they're

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
just not getting better,
would you at least see them?

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning
I was like, no,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
because I was afraid I would
get whatever they had since I

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:90%
had always been so sick.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.917 align:middle line:84%
But little by little, I
started to see clients.

00:18:18.917 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's really how I started.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's about 10
years ago, and now I

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:90%
have a full-time practice.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm truly grateful
to Donna in so many ways.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So your husband,
the medical doctor,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
got on board with
what you were doing.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:84%
What was his opinion
prior to this?

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:90%
What was he thinking?

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:84%
What was his opinion
about what to do?

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:90%
What was happening there?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FAURE: Well, so initially, he
probably wasn't that impressed

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and thought it might have
been a little woo-woo

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to convince
him to come down to Phoenix

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and we did the certification
program together.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And so by the end of that
certification program,

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
he understood then when
he saw a patient that

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.275 align:middle line:84%
had something here
on their body,

00:19:01.275 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:84%
well, that corresponds
to lung meridian.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to implement
and integrate that

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:90%
into his practice.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's so often the
case, that once someone

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
understands that there's
real science behind this

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and that there is a
system that we can follow,

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that there are systems
to all of this,

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:90%
then it becomes acceptable.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important
for our viewers

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that it isn't
the woo-woo that it used

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:90%
to be considered years ago.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a new day.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, it's
worked for you.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, can you share
what techniques worked for you

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:90%
regarding Donna's practices?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FAURE: So with respect
to the back pain,

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
what I love about Eden
Energy Medicine is I call it

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.235 align:middle line:90%
two-for-one or three-for-one.

00:19:47.235 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I actually was
working with something

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
called large intestine
neuro lymphatics, which

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
are reflex points along
the sides of the legs.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And that actually corresponds
to the L4, L5 on the back.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually why my
back pain was creating the pain

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
down the sides of my leg that no
one could understand or explain

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So once I learned how to work
with that energy on the sides

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:84%
of my legs, it actually
benefited my large intestine

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to cure two
things at the same time, which

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:90%
is pretty amazing.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
people need to know

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
is that when the energy is
blocked, a variety of symptoms

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:90%
will show up.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And we feel like
we're falling apart

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
but it's really only
like one thing that's

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:90%
going on in a particular area.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And you tapped into that and
made a tremendous difference

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FAURE: Absolutely.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Most of the clients that
walk through my door,

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.245 align:middle line:84%
I've sort of been
in their shoes.

00:20:41.245 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So I understand what
they're experiencing,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and I just see myself as
more just on the same path

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:84%
but a little bit
further down the lane.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And helping each
other along that path.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FAURE: Helping
each other along.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Dianne, so much
for being with us today.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Thank you, Dianne.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's wonderful.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.907 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's wonderful to share and
to hear about your successes.

00:20:58.907 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:90%
All the best to you.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Keep helping people.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FAURE: Thanks.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.452 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:21:02.452 --> 00:21:03.925 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Keep it up.

00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So Donna, when
Dianne came to you,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.650 align:middle line:84%
what did you see
needed to happen?

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.910 align:middle line:10%
>>EDEN: Well, I saw that her
energies were not crossing over

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:10%
at all, which means that,
well, human beings were meant

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:10%
to have energy from one
side of the body cross

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.653 align:middle line:10%
over to the other
side and vice versa.

00:21:22.653 --> 00:21:24.070 align:middle line:84%
The cross crawl,
things like that.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Cross crawl, yes.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: But it wasn't
happening with her.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Her energies were going
straight up and down.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that there was going
to be, yes, definite direction

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:90%
for her back.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that she was going
to have to straighten out

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:84%
her energy so that they could
make that-- those circuitries

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:90%
could connect.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And what is the role of
the environment, would you say,

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
on our body's ability to
adapt and on our energy

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:90%
system itself?

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: It's very big.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '90s, after I'd had
years and years of being very

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
well, I was shocked to be sort
of attacked by the environment.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I got what I call at that
time were electromagnetics.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But I now know that
they were EMFs,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic frequencies.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.233 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:17.233 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But I really got it, to
the point that my aura got

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:90%
totally frayed.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have an aura left.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So I could pick up anything and
everything that everybody had.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I knew what was
going on in them.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
It was like there was no
separation from my body

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:90%
to their body.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And it was really debilitating.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But at nighttime, when
I'd lay in my bed,

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:84%
energy would come
up from the earth.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And if I wasn't out of bed
by 3:00 in the morning,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I was utterly stiff and
I couldn't use my hands.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't-- so I just
had to figure it out.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I literally-- how I began
to figure it out was I went

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and started staying in
other people's houses.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:90%
I stayed in hotels.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I tried to find out, what
it happening everywhere?

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:90%
Was this just me?

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, I mean, I
knew my aura was gone.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And I knew you couldn't
live a healthy life

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:90%
with your aura gone.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know how
to get my aura back.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And we actually called a guy,
who his job was with NASA,

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
his job was to make sure that
astronauts were protected

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.290 align:middle line:84%
in their vessels because there
was so much electromagnetic

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:90%
going on in there.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And he had retired and lived in
the town nearby, and he came by

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and he said I was
one of the worst--

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
maybe I was the worst
case he'd ever seen,

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
because I was picking up
radio frequencies in my teeth

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:90%
and I mean, I was--

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:90%
and it turns out that we lived--

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the house that we
lived in, they had

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to divert a creek to be
able to build a house there.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But the underground
river was still there,

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
so it was coming up through all
of the circuitry in the house.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:90%
I was really picking it up.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So it took me time to
figure that one out.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And I started working
with magnets, actually,

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to turn the circuitry
around, and tape magnets

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.780 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom of my feet
and the bottom of my hands

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
until I began to
build an aura again

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and I began to work with
the field around me.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.612 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do you still use
magnets in your therapies

00:24:27.612 --> 00:24:28.820 align:middle line:90%
or recommend them for people?

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: You know, it's about
the only thing that I will do

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:90%
at times, when somebody--

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I will use it as
homework very often.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
When somebody is
in really bad shape

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and they have something
so debilitating in them,

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
we could put the magnet
in the right place,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
or I could teach them
to twirl the magnet out

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:84%
into their field, or
whatever it is they need.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, and it's
not a very strong magnet.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a very weak magnet.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But it just extends
your energy so

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
that if your energy
has gotten too frail,

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
you can extend your energy
a little bit with a magnet.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.880 align:middle line:84%
As people come into their
bodies with their consciousness

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and they ground
themselves, their energy

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
becomes more robust,
more quickly, too.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So it has this magnetic
pull from the earth

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're utilizing
to enhance this.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And so many, many
things that we can

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.065 align:middle line:90%
do to start to enhance this.

00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's so
important that people

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
know that there are techniques
that they can learn that they

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:84%
can start to get their energy
flowing in their system

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and enhance the robustness
of this auric field, which

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
is the bio field
that we talk about.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy field
that builds our system.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's designed to run and
heal our system all the time.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Yes, and it will affect
their consciousness, I mean.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:90%
And so one feeds the other.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, back
and forth, that we

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:84%
can choose things consciously
to enhance the field.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And when the field enhances,
it elevates our consciousness.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we can do it
even more and it just

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.382 align:middle line:90%
keeps building on itself.

00:25:57.382 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Living in this world
that we're living in

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:84%
with all these
external influences,

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
once you're hooking someone up
with their circuits in the ways

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:84%
that you are moving the
energy, again, I guess,

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
is what do you feel is
happening with Wi-Fi and EMFs

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.663 align:middle line:90%
in our externalized world?

00:26:15.663 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:90%
What do we need to do?

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Well, your body has
to deal with all of that.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So you're being confronted
with that energy sometime

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.400 align:middle line:84%
coming right into your
body all the time.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And people don't know it,
but they might know that--

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:84%
they might say, I felt so good
and then suddenly, I didn't.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was going on.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, energy was going on
that was affecting their body.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I teach is something
called a daily routine.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:84%
It takes six or seven minutes,
that helps just straighten out

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
your energy, helps the
energies cross over,

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:84%
hooks up the certain
things that you

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.570 align:middle line:84%
want hooked up because they
will affect everything.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you've given six or
seven minutes a day to that,

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you'll need
it to do it again

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
at another time in
the day, but you help

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:90%
the circuitry stay connected.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.060 align:middle line:10%
And then you can do
more individual things,

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:10%
like Dianne needed, you know,
something more individual,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:10%
like the lymphatic
points on her legs.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's many things
that can be very specific.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you get all of
the systems connected up,

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
it affects your circuitry and
your mind and everything just

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
starts working.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Maybe you
can show us some

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.616 align:middle line:84%
of those things at some point
today in our conversation?

00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Oh, god, I'd love to.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I would love to.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fabulous.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.052 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to that.

00:27:33.052 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
In the near future,
in the next 10 years,

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:84%
let's say, what do you
think the role of energy

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
medicine versus
antibiotics, medications,

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:84%
these kind of symptom relieving
remedies that we're pursuing,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.827 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen here?

00:27:47.827 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And what would you
like to see happen?

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Well, I really
believe that Western medicine

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and energy medicine
are going to start

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.370 align:middle line:90%
walking more hand-in-hand.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And I think they have to.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Even in Western medicine, I
mean, you see things, I mean,

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
even an MRI machine is a lot of
magnets and affects the energy.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So there are things that Western
medicine has started to use.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But because they
have so little time,

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I actually think they're going
to begin to expand their time

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:90%
to give patients more energy.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I completely agree.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
patients are, just

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
like patients started asking
for supplementation instead

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of medications, patients
are also asking for,

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.130 align:middle line:90%
what can I do at home?

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And that, you know, it kind of
invites our medical community

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to lean into some of these more
natural preventive measures.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have
specific approaches

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to testing this
energy and noticing

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:51.110 align:middle line:84%
how it's flowing with
someone and evaluating

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:54.110 align:middle line:84%
what needs to happen
first, second, and third.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.915 align:middle line:84%
So before we dive
into some of that,

00:28:55.915 --> 00:28:57.290 align:middle line:84%
can you just
explain a little bit

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:01.100 align:middle line:84%
about what is energy testing,
so that our viewers can

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.683 align:middle line:84%
kind of, you know,
catch up, make sure

00:29:02.683 --> 00:29:04.725 align:middle line:84%
that they're coming along
and know that we're all

00:29:04.725 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:90%
on the same page.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.122 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
there when we're

00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:90%
doing this energy testing?

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Well, energy
testing allows you--

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like a
natural biofeedback tool.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not testing-- and a long
time ago, I changed the name

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.900 align:middle line:90%
for myself from muscle testing.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew you
weren't testing

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:90%
the strength of the muscle.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You're testing how is
energy flowing in the body.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And then over time,
it got more and more

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:90%
how the energy was flowing.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But you can really
get instant feedback

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening in
your body in a particular area

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and what is needed,
and you can also

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.010 align:middle line:84%
see that you can
shift the energy

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and that a person who has never
done this before in their life

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
can do what I'm going to do
with you in fixing something.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do it.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.543 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Excellent.

00:29:53.543 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: It's our birthright.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Just to differentiate with
muscle testing versus energy

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
testing, we're kind of
doing the same thing.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's a mindset
and it's an awareness

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:84%
that we want to realize
that the muscle can only

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.480 align:middle line:84%
be as strong as it can
be, if the juice is

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:84%
coming to it to make it do
what it's supposed to do.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.305 align:middle line:84%
So we're testing to see if
the juice is coming here.

00:30:14.305 --> 00:30:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
the muscle works.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:84%
You can pick up a suitcase or
a plate out of the dishwasher.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.110 align:middle line:90%
The muscles are working.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But how efficiently,
how effectively,

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
how comprehensively is the
juice coming to that muscle

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.063 align:middle line:84%
so that it does what it's
supposed to do instantly,

00:30:29.063 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:90%
when it's supposed to do it.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Am I tracking with you?

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Exactly.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So just one more question
before we dive in.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.110 align:middle line:84%
We know that
there's a difference

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.230 align:middle line:84%
between our consciousness
and our subconsciousness

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and that healing happens not
just in our conscious mind

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
but in the subconsciousness
our whole being.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.252 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we would
just consciously decide,

00:30:51.252 --> 00:30:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be well, my back's
going to be fine, my necks,

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.335 align:middle line:84%
my allergies are just
going to go away.

00:30:55.335 --> 00:30:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And it would, poof,
it would be gone.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So we know there's something
else going on there.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.748 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're doing
for, just for the viewers

00:31:00.748 --> 00:31:03.220 align:middle line:84%
to understand that what
we're doing is saying,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.080 align:middle line:84%
there's more to the picture and
we also have access to that,

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.880 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.462 align:middle line:84%
So even though
it's subconscious,

00:31:08.462 --> 00:31:09.670 align:middle line:90%
we can start to work with it.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.413 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding of muscle
testing and energy testing

00:31:12.413 --> 00:31:14.080 align:middle line:84%
is that that's exactly
what we're doing.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:84%
We're able to read what's
happening at the subconscious

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:90%
level and have access.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So can you just speak
a little bit to that?

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yes.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, subconsciously people
are carrying around programs,

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.180 align:middle line:84%
also, you know, of
negativity or of what

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.970 align:middle line:84%
they feel about
themselves or their ideas

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:90%
about different things.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:84%
They're carrying
all of that around.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And often, when
they think that they

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:84%
should be able to get well
or not think that anymore,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:84%
well, their conscious
mind can't always

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:84%
do that, because it is not
is as available to them

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.970 align:middle line:90%
as their subconscious mind.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
important realization,

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I think, for people to know,
that you can work with both

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.960 align:middle line:84%
to affect your health
and your vitality

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and your aliveness and
your positive outlook

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.490 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
But you often can't just snap
out of something in your mind.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.970 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
You've got to then start
programming it differently.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of
sneaking in the backdoor

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.622 align:middle line:84%
and showing the
system how to be OK.

00:32:23.622 --> 00:32:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And the mind is kind
of the last to know.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.462 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, it turns
out, I feel better.

00:32:27.462 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And so we're working at it from
both directions, front door

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:90%
and back door.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yes.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And I had my practice--

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I had a practice for,
I don't know, 23 years.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And I loved it when
a skeptic would

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.760 align:middle line:84%
come who really didn't believe
it was going to happen to him.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So his mind could be set that
this isn't going to happen.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in my
practice I had it

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that nobody had to pay
me if it didn't work.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.727 align:middle line:90%
And they always paid.

00:32:54.727 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank goodness it worked.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Because it worked.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Because it worked.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: But I also
know that the mind

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.830 align:middle line:90%
is in every cell in your body.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:07.900 align:middle line:84%
In every place, in
every energy system,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.110 align:middle line:84%
the mind travels so that
you might think it's just up

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.200 align:middle line:90%
in here, but it isn't.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And so you can be
reached in other ways.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
This is this standing energy
that we're speaking about,

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that our consciousness
is everywhere.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of
our mind connecting

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:27.160 align:middle line:84%
to the deep true consciousness,
the deep, true conscious being

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being all scattered
and worrying about this

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and being off on other stories,
consciously or subconsciously,

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.998 align:middle line:84%
we're teaching people to
come home to yourself.

00:33:36.998 --> 00:33:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's open up the trap
door between the conscious

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.582 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious
that got slammed

00:33:40.582 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:84%
shut in those moments of fight
or flight, those moments that

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.640 align:middle line:90%
were overwhelming to us.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:90%
It slams down.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And the last message that
got through was, emergency.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.995 align:middle line:84%
So we've been acting on
this emergency ever since.

00:33:51.995 --> 00:33:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: That's right.

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We're opening
that up and saying,

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.635 align:middle line:84%
you know what, turns out the
war is over, you know, let's

00:33:56.635 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:90%
all exhale.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a better life.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So would you mind
demonstrating on me?

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Ah, love to, yes.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.050 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.969 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Well, I think I
would love to just show you,

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:84%
everyone, how electromagnetic
our energies are.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
energy test you, OK?

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great
biofeedback tool.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.449 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to push down.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:20.350 align:middle line:90%
And you're strong.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.820 align:middle line:90%
She's very strong.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to walk back here.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to--

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.520 align:middle line:90%
I won't tell you what I'm doing.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK, just do your things.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: I don't want
to influence you.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you afterwards.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to go like this.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.221 align:middle line:90%
Now put your arm up again.

00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE:
[MURRR NOISE AND LAUGHTER]..

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: So what I did was I
traced a meridian backwards.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:90%
And it'll happen for everybody.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.219 align:middle line:84%
Because the energies on your
hands are electromagnetic

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:53.659 align:middle line:84%
and the energy on the
meridian is electromagnetic.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:55.909 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to see if
we can give it back to her.

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:56.675 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, please do.

00:34:56.675 --> 00:34:57.565 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: OK.

00:34:57.565 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And I do not have to touch her.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.890 align:middle line:90%
I could just trace in the field.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Truth is, I could
stand way back.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got
a very big aura,

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
so I could be way back
on the edge of your aura.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
far back I can walk.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.250 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to--

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: We get it, though.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.380 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps going.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.338 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: It keeps going.

00:35:15.338 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Awesome.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: But auras
are influenced.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:84%
We are influenced by
other people's energies.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You bet.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:90%
You bet we are.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: And so
that's what that was.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Excellent.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Would you like--

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this is just showing
people that energy is flowing,

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and it has an impact
on us how it's flowing.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I could probably do things--
at least I know in my own study

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that I could do things that
would weaken my own aura,

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:41.320 align:middle line:84%
like doubt myself or
be mad at something

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.240 align:middle line:84%
or carry something around,
that kind of stuff.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Absolutely.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.695 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Has the same effect.

00:35:44.695 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yes, yes.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's also important
to know that other things

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:84%
in our environment
can affect us,

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.840 align:middle line:84%
like going into a room
that didn't feel so good.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Any of those things.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.675 align:middle line:84%
But you can get your own
energy back at any time.

00:35:57.675 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you're
going to show us how.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:35:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: OK.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So here, first we're going to
see if you're nice and strong.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.925 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going
to smash your nose.

00:36:04.925 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: A nose job.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I need a nose job, is that
what you're telling me?

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: But did you notice
you lost your energy?

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is an energy
governing meridian

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that goes up your back, over
your head, over your nose,

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and then connects at
the back of your throat

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:22.425 align:middle line:84%
with central meridian
that goes up this way.

00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're not connected.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Governing this.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Yeah, governing
and central connect.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And you're not connected.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's an easy
way to find out.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But I would love to
show something else.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.580 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to turn you, OK?

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm touching-- I'm going
to touch right at her waist,

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of her spine.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.090 align:middle line:90%
And she loses her energy.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This is called
energy localizing.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to the place
to see if the energy is

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:90%
going up or not.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Now she's got phenomenal energy.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But this can affect
her a little bit.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you want these two
energies, two meridians,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.560 align:middle line:90%
central and governing.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:90%
And she starts-- oh, shoot.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Once you get to
her head, she's--

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: My crown chakra
knows what it's doing.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yeah, her crown chakra.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:90%
So this is so good.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can do this so easily.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you put one finger
in your belly button,

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.700 align:middle line:90%
one finger at your third eye.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Does it
matter which finger?

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: No.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I tend to use my middle.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But no, whichever
feels right to you.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And the other at the third eye.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:31.685 align:middle line:90%
Push in and pull them both up.

00:37:31.685 --> 00:37:32.565 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:32.565 --> 00:37:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And it may make you breathe,
and that would be good

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:90%
if you did breathe.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.729 align:middle line:90%
This kind of pulls you together.

00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:42.194 align:middle line:90%
[INHALING AND EXHALING]

00:37:42.194 --> 00:37:52.547 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.547 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And you usually know
when you're done.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It usually takes--

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, I can feel it.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yeah.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.223 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to
smash your nose again.

00:38:00.223 --> 00:38:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Waap.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.105 align:middle line:90%
I know she's very strong.

00:38:04.105 --> 00:38:05.105 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Can't touch this.

00:38:05.105 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: And I'm going to
touch at her spine again.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:90%
She's strong.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And what that means,
it's more than governing

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and central are connected
at the back of her throat.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It means that she's now
pumping up cerebrospinal fluid.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very good for
everything in your body.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's very good for
your nervous system.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It's very good for
your nervous system.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And while you're doing
this interview, I mean,

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
everything was working very
well up here in your head.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you were then
to get up afterwards

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and you want to go
skate or something,

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.780 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be
coordinated as much.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy
was all up in here.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:49.942 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:38:49.942 --> 00:38:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: And this
is also very good,

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:84%
as I said, for the
nervous system.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:58.540 align:middle line:84%
If anyone has seizures, I mean,
this will pull them right out

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.740 align:middle line:90%
of a seizure.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.730 align:middle line:90%
It's that good.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Grounds us.

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Pulls us right back in,
connects up the circuits.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: I tend to go into body--

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, different
parts of me, you know,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:84%
where suddenly I'm
not pulled together.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just immediately
hook up, and I'm fine again.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm back.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: I'm back.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fabulous.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So are you intuiting anything
when you're doing this?

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Or are you just-- you're just--

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.210 align:middle line:84%
you're doing the energy testing,
you know the process that we do

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.320 align:middle line:84%
next, and then do
that, and boom, it's--

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and my question comes
from, anyone can do this?

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Anyone.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Anyone can do this.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Anyone can do this.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's a system that they
can follow and do with others.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yes, yes.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:84%
When I had my practice, I
often had families come in.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And little tiny children can
learn how to energy test.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And the parents can learn
how to energy test kids.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.410 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to push
with all their might,

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.660 align:middle line:90%
because it isn't a muscle test.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But they can, with a
child, you can acclimate

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.880 align:middle line:90%
to whatever is their strength.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Like you wouldn't have to push
a wall with all your might

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.400 align:middle line:90%
to know it's going to stand.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So you start getting
that sensitivity.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And energy testing in itself
begins to build a sensitivity.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.593 align:middle line:90%
It's circuitry, right?

00:40:15.593 --> 00:40:17.635 align:middle line:84%
We build it just like we
learn how to drive a car

00:40:17.635 --> 00:40:19.900 align:middle line:84%
or learn how to roller
skate, as you say.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.270 align:middle line:84%
We develop the ability
to sense and feel

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:84%
how to work with these
energies in just the right way

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that we get the feedback
that we're looking for.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.167 align:middle line:84%
There's a communication system
that's trying to communicate,

00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't been trained at
all to pay any attention to it.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: No, and I
think, I mean, energy

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.480 align:middle line:84%
is the language
your body speaks.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, it's a
wonderful language to learn.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And it will make
you much, much more

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:47.590 align:middle line:84%
functionally
beautiful in this life

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.450 align:middle line:84%
if your energies are
all working well.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.860 align:middle line:90%
So what about sustainability?

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.526 align:middle line:84%
So we connect up this circuit
that was short circuiting.

00:40:55.526 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Does it last?

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you address cause and
how to keep it happening?

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: That's such a
good, good question.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going to come to
me or some other practitioner

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.890 align:middle line:84%
with a different place that
they are in their lives.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And some people have never
done anything for themselves

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it won't
hold very long.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
hold very long,

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.760 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
go into despair.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.560 align:middle line:84%
You want to say, oh,
I'm going to fix that.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
that start holding.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that and
do whatever technique

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:32.080 align:middle line:84%
it is that will help you,
it will get stronger,

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.350 align:middle line:84%
the habit will build, your body
will not fall apart as easily.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.380 align:middle line:90%
You just get better and better.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's something-- it's like
we have some pretty bad habits

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.570 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies right now.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.030 align:middle line:90%
And this is building new habits.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And you will like aging.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.840 align:middle line:90%
You will like aging.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the best things

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell people, to
know that your are empowered.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So I know that you
have your daily routine

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.740 align:middle line:90%
that you spoke about.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
sharing that with us--

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: No.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.925 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --and teaching the world
what you recommend for 10 or 11

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:09.050 align:middle line:90%
minutes a day, did you say?

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: OK, OK.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:12.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
things you want to do

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.530 align:middle line:84%
is you want to know that your
energies are crossing over.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So without anybody
energy testing you,

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:18.940 align:middle line:84%
you can just start
building it into the habit.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Even if you've got it a little
bit, you can make it better.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is put one
hand on your shoulder.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Push in hard and drag it
across to the opposite hip.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And now go to the other side.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And just push in hard
and drag it across.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:37.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will tell me
that they can begin to feel it.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.980 align:middle line:90%
You do it several times.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:84%
If you've got anybody
in your family who

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:44.530 align:middle line:84%
will do it on your back,
let them do it on your back,

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and cross that energy
over and build that habit.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:52.710 align:middle line:84%
The next thing to do is,
hook up, like you just did.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Because often when you
wake up in the morning,

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.560 align:middle line:84%
you might not be
all pulled together.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.985 align:middle line:90%
But this will pull you together.

00:42:59.985 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the first ones
impacting the primitive brain,

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.060 align:middle line:84%
the medulla, where
synapses cross over.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yes.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This one is
connecting the diaphragm

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and the center, the third
eye, all of these things

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:14.530 align:middle line:90%
are coming together.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:15.863 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Everything is connected.

00:43:15.863 --> 00:43:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And it also, when
you connect up,

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.250 align:middle line:84%
these are not just
two meridians.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.120 align:middle line:84%
You create the microcosmic
orbit that goes

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.250 align:middle line:90%
around your body in both ways.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, your aura
is impacted so that you're

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:32.870 align:middle line:90%
just more protected in the day.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's a really good one.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:34.873 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Real present.

00:43:34.873 --> 00:43:35.950 align:middle line:90%
So we're crossing over?

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Right.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then we're
hooking up again?

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yep.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Then what?

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: We're going
to do the four thumps.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.735 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:43:41.735 --> 00:43:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: The first one, start
tapping on your cheekbones

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.060 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.840 align:middle line:84%
What this does, this is the
beginning of the stomach

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.110 align:middle line:84%
meridian, and it
pulses the energy

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.330 align:middle line:84%
that goes all the
way down your body

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and connects you
to planet Earth.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So then you're more
available for energy

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:84%
to come up and receive
some of that great energy.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the first one.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.660 align:middle line:90%
The second one is on K-27.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.580 align:middle line:90%
This is the 27th point.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It's right underneath
the collarbone.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to tap
it so much on my chest,

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.650 align:middle line:84%
but you really
tap it right there

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:90%
underneath the collarbone.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And K-27 is the 27th
point on kidney meridian.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's a juncture point.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So it turns all energy around
that's going backwards.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: We got it.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yeah.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.395 align:middle line:84%
And the next one I'm
really not going to tap.

00:44:32.395 --> 00:44:36.293 align:middle line:84%
But you want to tap your chest
right there, your thymus.

00:44:36.293 --> 00:44:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now the reason
you're not tapping

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.010 align:middle line:90%
it is because of a microphone.

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: I've got a
microphone there.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And we don't want
to hurt everybody's ears.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:84%
But you really do tap it
when you're tapping it.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: You tap it.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.645 align:middle line:90%
But think of Tarzan.

00:44:44.645 --> 00:44:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So it's like thumping.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:46.116 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yeah.

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:48.400 align:middle line:84%
You know how Tarzan thumps
there before he ever

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.220 align:middle line:90%
swings on the vine?

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:54.180 align:middle line:90%
You want to thump like that.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And the last one is just
a rib below your bra line.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And the guys
and their bras?

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:00.860 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: You've got to imagine.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.000 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: And then you
thump right there.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.480 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Just kind of
digging in with your thumb?

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yes.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And these are really important.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, see.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll just tell you.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:14.690 align:middle line:84%
You start being able to
read your body better.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I got chills on my legs when
I did it, chills on my arms,

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.328 align:middle line:90%
which means I needed this one.

00:45:20.328 --> 00:45:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all are
needing different things

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.290 align:middle line:90%
at different times.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:25.390 align:middle line:10%
And that's on
spleen meridian that

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:30.070 align:middle line:10%
governs how you're metabolizing
food or electromagnetics,

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:31.210 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.310 align:middle line:90%
How are you metabolizing it?

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Is your body able to
adapt or throw it off?

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So that one is a
really important one.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Spleen is so important.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:40.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's so under--

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:90%
misunderstood, or you know.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Absolutely.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:47.613 align:middle line:84%
And it was baseline for me
in my illnesses, the spleen.

00:45:47.613 --> 00:45:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's the receptor
of so much spiritual energy

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.965 align:middle line:84%
and integrated into the
enteric system for us.

00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:52.765 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Exactly.

00:45:52.765 --> 00:45:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's so beautiful.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Straightening out my
energies not only got me well,

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.950 align:middle line:84%
but that is how I can
teach all over the world.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I can do what I need to
do to get my energies flowing.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And everyone
that is living the life

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that they are living,
they're maxing

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.830 align:middle line:90%
into their own experiences.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And so these things super
helpful to get them to ground

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and to integrate
and to flow again.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EDEN: Yes.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Every human being
on the planet needs

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:25.460 align:middle line:90%
what you and I are teaching.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.260 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.167 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you know,
it's our intention to--

00:46:28.167 --> 00:46:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: And we're coming
home to it more and more.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --to share.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Donna, how can people
find out more about you?

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.120 align:middle line:10%
>>EDEN: They can
go to our website,

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.500 align:middle line:10%
learnenergymedicine.com.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:45.820 align:middle line:10%
They can go onto YouTube, a
YouTube, and put in, let's see,

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.640 align:middle line:10%
the Wednesday Energy Minute.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Either me or one
of my kids will put

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:84%
in an energy minute
of something they

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.420 align:middle line:84%
can learn in one minute,
every week on Wednesday.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Your story is so important.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important what
you're doing in the world.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And we are so very blessed to
have had this conversation.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EDEN: Sue, this
has been so special.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:09.825 align:middle line:90%
You're great.

00:47:09.825 --> 00:47:10.625 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: My joy.

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Donna Eden's tools
can empower all of us

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.910 align:middle line:84%
to catalyze deeper balance
and healing within our bodies

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:20.680 align:middle line:90%
and within our environments.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Energy medicine is so
important because it

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:26.770 align:middle line:84%
is a modality that recognizes
we are truly energetic beings.

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:28.900 align:middle line:10%
We are far more than
flesh and blood,

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.025 align:middle line:10%
and we can take control
of our own true power.

00:47:32.025 --> 00:47:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter,
and thank you

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.790 align:middle line:90%
for watching "Healing Matrix."

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:90%
