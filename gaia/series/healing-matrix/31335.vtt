>>REGINA MEREDITH:
If you're a parent,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.236 align:middle line:10%
you've probably been faced
with a couple of very difficult

00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:10%
situations: the
choice of whether

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:10%
or not to have your child
vaccinated, and whether

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:10%
or not to allow them to use
fluoride in their dental care.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:10%
If you listen to the
official stories, what

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:10%
seems to be a logical
case can be made for both.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:10%
But a choice for either can
have severe repercussions,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.780 align:middle line:10%
including lowered immune
function and lowered

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:10%
IQ in your child.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm here in Austin, Texas
with Mike Adams, also

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:10%
known as The Health Ranger.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:10%
He's spent a great deal
of time researching

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.986 align:middle line:10%
both of these topics.

00:01:03.986 --> 00:01:05.443 align:middle line:10%
We're going to
start with fluoride.

00:01:05.443 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm so glad to be
sitting here with you.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.805 align:middle line:10%
I've been going through
your site for years now.

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Conscious
Media Network,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:10%
we used to recommend a lot
of people go to your site.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.233 align:middle line:90%
You are a health ranger.

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:16.566 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE ADAMS: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You rock.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It's great to be here.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I admire what you're
doing, as well.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm happy to be
contributing here today.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:10%
And I love your little
film on fluoride,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:10%
because even though
it's a little film,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:10%
and I love the retro animation
that you chose to use.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:10%
It's so cute.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.600 align:middle line:10%
Very '50s, very '40s even.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:10%
But it tells a really
important story.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:10%
First, before we
show a clip, what

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:10%
made you decide to
take that project on?

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Well, fluoride is
the most important toxin

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:10%
that people take
into their bodies,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:10%
I should say the
most profound toxin

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:10%
that people are exposed to
on an involuntary basis.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:10%
So it's added to the water
without your knowledge

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:10%
and you're dosing on
this psychoactive drug--

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:10%
it is a drug-- without
a prescription,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:10%
without a medical diagnosis, and
without any warnings whatsoever

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:10%
about you might have
extra fluoride from food,

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:10%
from other sources.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Bottled water sometimes
adds fluoride.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You might be
overdosing on fluoride

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:90%
without even knowing it.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But the real issue is that
fluoride isn't fluoride.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
naturally occurring fluoride

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:84%
that's found in the
groundwater, that's

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
not the same compound
molecule of fluoride

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that is being dumped into
the water supply in cities.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
That molecule is called
hexafluorosilicic acid.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.465 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of variations

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.048 align:middle line:84%
that are dumped into
the water supply,

00:02:43.048 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
like hydrofluorosilicic
acid as well.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But these molecules are not
naturally occurring fluoride,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:90%
so it's misnamed fluoride.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
When they say we're
fluoridating your water,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%
they're actually not.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
They're poisoning your water
with a different chemical

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.842 align:middle line:90%
compound.

00:02:57.842 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we're going to talk

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
about why they're doing
this because that's really

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:90%
a key part of it.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.702 align:middle line:10%
So obviously, you have
taken a great deal of time

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:10%
to educate yourself
on the subject,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:10%
and I assume you felt
that animation, which

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:10%
I am a total believer in,
was one of the best ways

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:10%
to drive it home in a
short amount of time.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: People don't want to
be bored by scientific articles,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:90%
scientific lingo even.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.025 align:middle line:10%
They want to get the gist of it
in a fun and entertaining way

00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:10%
that they can easily
share with others,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:10%
so that's what the
animation is all about.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, we're going
to take a little look.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: All right.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.143 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let's take a
look at about just a minute

00:03:33.143 --> 00:03:34.119 align:middle line:10%
or two of the film.

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:41.604 align:middle line:10%

00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:10%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So what we just
heard in that final little bit

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:10%
there was that this
stuff is considered

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:10%
highly toxic by the EPA.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:10%
And later in the
film, you mentioned,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:10%
which I thought was so perfect,
if we were to go and dump

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:10%
that stuff in the
water supply, it

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:10%
would be called an
act of terrorism.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:10%
Under the US Patriot
Act anyone who

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:10%
takes fluoride concentrated
toxic chemicals,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:10%
the hexafluorosilicic acid,
for example, if they were

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:10%
to dump that into
a water supply,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:10%
they could be
arrested and charged

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.514 align:middle line:10%
and prosecuted as a terrorist.

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: But if you drip it
slowly into everyone's water,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.488 align:middle line:90%
it's called public health.

00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:29.467 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well now, since we
didn't let our viewers have

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:10%
the advantage of seeing the
entire animated film, which

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.650 align:middle line:10%
I highly recommend
you do by the way,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:10%
I think it would be
good for you to tell us

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:10%
a little bit about
the history of it

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:10%
in terms of why they
started doing it,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:10%
part of mining process, the
connection with phosphorus

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:10%
and all of it.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:10%
Just give us a long
version of it now.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.121 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Well, let's start
with the table of elements.

00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to get
overly scientific here,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
but I think everybody
remembers the table of elements

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
from high school science
class or college chemistry

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Fluorine is the element
in the table of elements

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that is one of the most
reactive elements, most toxic.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, it is
used throughout industry

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of chemical
processes and chemical

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.416 align:middle line:90%
compounds.

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
main ingredients,

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
by the way, in certain
antidepressant drugs,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
because it reacts with
brain chemistry in a highly

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:90%
reactive way.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:90%
So it has many, many functions.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:84%
But another main
function of fluoride,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
which is a slightly
different form of fluorine,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
the element, fluoride is the
chemical molecular structure

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
of fluorine, it's not
just the isolated element,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
but it is used as
an insecticide.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.849 align:middle line:10%
So if you go to China,
and most of our fluoride

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:10%
comes from China that's dumped
into municipal water supplies.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
comforting, isn't it.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.411 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it's contaminated
with many other trace metals.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Typically arsenic, cadmium,
lead, mercury, those

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
are the four most
worrisome heavy metals

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that you might typically
find in quote "fluoride."

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:10%
But it's sold out of China
with marketing text that

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.020 align:middle line:10%
says this is a
great insecticide.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:10%
You spray this on crops,
it kills everything.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very commonly
used insecticide.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.300 align:middle line:84%
The same marketing material
out of China-- and we

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
did an investigation
on this and we

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
showed the pictures of
the big 40-foot containers

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:84%
with bags of fluoride hanging
out the back, and it said,

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
this is great for use in
metals smelting chemistry,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
other industrial uses

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't
ever want to eat.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.116 align:middle line:10%
And then at the
very end, it says,

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:10%
also you can use it
to fluoridate water.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:10%
So they're admitting
this is a deadly poison.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
It kills living
systems, which is

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:90%
why it works as an insecticide.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's an industrial chemical.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a highly reactive element
and a chemical compound

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:90%
in various forms.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:90%
And they're saying drink it.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is, I think, one of the
biggest public health hoaxes

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever seen in history.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:10%
And I know you'll
love this to get

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:10%
into sort of why
this is happening.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:10%
Let's do it, because this is
where it's called conspiracy

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.772 align:middle line:10%
theory, and we're all sick
of the word conspiracy.

00:08:34.772 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:10%
We're sick of it.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:10%
The fact is, it's just
people joining together

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:10%
with an agenda,
generally, illegally.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:10%
That's a conspiracy.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.127 align:middle line:10%
And this is a
genuine conspiracy.

00:08:43.127 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And as I like to say, I
borrowed this from someone else,

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not a
conspiracy theorist.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm a conspiracy analyst.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:10%
That's a fair thing to say.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:10%
That's very good.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:10%
I like that.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.593 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: There are all
kinds of conspiracies

00:08:55.593 --> 00:08:56.569 align:middle line:10%
all over the place.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Any two or three people get
together in a room and plot

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to do something evil,
that's a conspiracy.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the federal
government charges

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:10%
thousands of people
with conspiracy

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.312 align:middle line:10%
every year for various
crimes, so they

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:10%
believe in conspiracies, too.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
you certainly don't

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:10%
want to go to a
girls locker room

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:10%
when you're talking
about conspiring

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.775 align:middle line:10%
to do something evil.

00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: That's true, yeah.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:10%
So getting to why
this is happening.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:10%
Wow, you really have
to go back into,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:10%
I would say, the research
under Nazi Germany.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.404 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
Hitler, the Nazi regime

00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:84%
is blamed for all
kinds of things.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But factually, scientifically
speaking, this was really

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:84%
the grandfathering of the
modern pharmacological science,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:90%
was under the Nazi regime.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Where you had IG
Farben experimenting

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.301 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
chemistry and how

00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:84%
it affects humans, and
actually conducting

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:90%
experiments on humans.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it was the chairperson
of Bayer that went to prison,

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
was convicted under
the Nuremberg Trials,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:90%
for crimes against humanity.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:10%
And actually served prison
time and then came back

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:10%
and was the
chairperson of Bayer.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Wasn't the Bush family
heavily involved with Bayer?

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.111 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
grandfather Bush and on back,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:90%
yes, absolutely.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
they found with fluoride

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:84%
is that fluoride alters
brain biochemistry.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It alters brain function
in very specific ways

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that are useful to any
kind of, let's say,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
oppressive regime that wants to
prevent people from waking up.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they found that if
you put enough fluoride

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
into the water in prison camps,
that the prisoners were more

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
docile and they were
easier to control.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't have
ideas of breaking out

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and they wouldn't
be as rebellious.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And so some people
believe that fluoride

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
is put into the water supply
in the cities in North America

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and around the world today for
the same reason, that it keeps

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
people more docile,
they go along

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.509 align:middle line:90%
with whatever they're told.

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:10%
I would say there's
no proof of that,

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.560 align:middle line:10%
but that's one
interesting theory.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.180 align:middle line:10%
An actual conspiracy theory.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: But I think there's
another reason behind all this

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't have anything to do
with Nazi Germany or anything.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
It's well known that
fluoride interferes

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
with functioning of your
endocrine system, the glands.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:90%
The thyroid gland in particular.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And people who are familiar
with bioenergy and energetics

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
understand that these
glands are the gateways

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to spiritual connection,
to energetic layers that

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
exist beyond just the physical
and the biochemical layers

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.435 align:middle line:84%
of your human
spiritual existence.

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
really going on here

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.776 align:middle line:84%
is that fluoride shuts the
door to spiritual connection.

00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Which of
the glands-- I mean,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:10%
is it affecting the
pineal gland, for example?

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because that would be-

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: The pineal
gland, I think, is key.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: -heavily
impacting that gateway.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely key.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:10%
I think the thyroid gland,
which is very heavily

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.765 align:middle line:10%
poisoned by fluoride, is to
keep people with low energy.

00:12:08.765 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Keep them
chronically fatigued

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and to not have the creative
energy to do what they want.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But the pineal gland, or pineal
gland as pronunciations vary,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.156 align:middle line:84%
but that I think is
the gateway gland--

00:12:23.156 --> 00:12:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: -to connection.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And fluoride hammers that gland.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is why you
get so many people today

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.830 align:middle line:84%
who are somehow convinced,
and mainstream science

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
is teaching this, that you are
nothing but a biological skin

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:84%
bag of water and
bones and protein,

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and that you do not have any
existence beyond the physical.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
You have no consciousness, you
have no spirit, no free will.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.535 align:middle line:84%
And when you die, you're dead
and gone and that's permanent.

00:12:57.535 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a very
dangerous philosophy.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Because it excuses any
kind of behavior whatsoever.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It allows people
to abandon any kind

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.265 align:middle line:84%
of philosophical foundation,
moral code, ethical code

00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:14.554 align:middle line:84%
of treating other people
with basic human dignity

00:13:14.554 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
like they're not

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:84%
responsible for their
actions after this lifetime.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I happen to believe, and I think
many of your viewers believe,

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.967 align:middle line:90%
that our souls are eternal.

00:13:24.967 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: We survive this
physical experience.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And our souls,
some of our souls

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
are younger, some of our
souls are more mature,

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:84%
been around a few
times let's say.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.536 align:middle line:10%
We are ultimately
responsible for everything.

00:13:39.536 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The way
I put it is, we

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:10%
are the ones
inheriting this earth.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.625 align:middle line:10%
We always say, oh,
our grandchildren

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:44.791 align:middle line:10%
and our great grandchildren.

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:10%
It's like, how about you?

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.684 align:middle line:10%
Look what you're
going to inherit.

00:13:48.684 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: That's right.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.141 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I mean, really, when
you look at what's happening--

00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:54.751 align:middle line:10%
and this gets into a really
large and deep discussion.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yes, yes.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.624 align:middle line:10%
And my favorite discussion.

00:13:56.624 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: My favorite
discussion as well.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:10%
Because if you look at this from
the ultimate point of view--

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:10%
and we'll just go
here for a little bit,

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:10%
and I know some people
want to stay with this,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.685 align:middle line:10%
but I want to get back
into the nuts and bolts

00:14:10.685 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:10%
so we understand, so we
have facts to give parents

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:10%
about not fluoridating their
children and all of that.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:10%
But, to me, the big question
is-- the soul trumps all.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:10%
It can essentially--
everything that we

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.092 align:middle line:10%
see that we call miracles
are really not miracles.

00:14:28.092 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:10%
They're just the effect
of the soul being

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:10%
able to manage things
quite efficiently

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:10%
in the physical reality, right?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.730 align:middle line:10%
So, what happens to
this species if we

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:10%
keep tampering, genetically
tampering, because we

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:10%
are affecting the DNA through
all these things, right?

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:10%
So if we have this chain
effect of affecting DNA

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:10%
through all these toxins,
the big question to me

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:10%
is what happens when these
bodies keep replicating.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Is there a way for
somehow this to adapt,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:10%
or the soul to adapt to it?

00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:10%
You see what I'm saying?

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:10%
Or have we trashed this species
and souls have to flee and go

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:10%
elsewhere in order to have
that alive experience again.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.991 align:middle line:10%
And I'm just tossing it out
there as a question mark

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:10%
to consider.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I think that's a
really important question.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe,
and perhaps you

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
share elements of this belief,
that this physical universe is

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
in one sense kind of like
a simulation for the soul.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:28.206 align:middle line:84%
The soul enters the physical
body without a memory,

00:15:28.206 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because
that would be

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:90%
sort of cheating on the test.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, how
terrible would that-- well

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:84%
not only that, all the
trauma and everything else.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.887 align:middle line:90%
How awful that would be.

00:15:34.887 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: True.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So you're here to discover
who you are, what you believe,

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
how you're going to interact
with other conscious beings,

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:84%
what are your values,
to discover yourself

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.670 align:middle line:90%
with a clean slate.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a training ground.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Now in order to experience
this training ground

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:84%
in the proper way
that I think is

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
intended by the creative forces
of the greater universe that

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
somehow put all this
in place, I think

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
have clarity of mind.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So if you're-- now, I
believe that your consciousness

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:84%
interfaces with
the physical brain.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:90%
This is the interface.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And if the interface goes bad,
then the signals get distorted.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And so
even a person-- you

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:84%
hear stories about people,
for example, going mad

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
because of metals poisoning.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Too much copper, too much lead,
these things can drive you mad.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.520 align:middle line:84%
The soul is still interfacing
with the physical brain,

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
but the brain has
become crippled

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and has gone insane, meaning
that it can't properly

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
translate the signals
from the soul;

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
meaning that lifetime, which
is supposed to be a testing

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
ground, has become a disastrous
biological failure that traps

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
the soul until that
biological life is over.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.961 align:middle line:10%
The soul is set free, returned
back to source, let's say.

00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Very well put.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.150 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: And then gets
another chance, perhaps

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:10%
through another body.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:10%
But we are crippling
the physical bodies

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.227 align:middle line:10%
and the physical brain
matter across the population

00:17:15.227 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:10%
of this world.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you see
people like yourself

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:10%
and myself and the way I raised
my son and many, many, many

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.930 align:middle line:10%
of the people watching this,
who have chosen to opt out

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:10%
on every level they can from
this kind of degradation

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:10%
of the physical body and brain.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:10%
And so you almost
wonder if one is alert,

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:10%
such as you watching
this right now,

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:10%
and you are taking
every care you can,

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.837 align:middle line:10%
and some of it we can't.

00:17:42.837 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:10%
We have chemtrails.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And some people were
drinking fluoridated water

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:10%
long before they
knew it was an issue.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:10%
So I mean that's already--
what's been done is done.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.745 align:middle line:10%
You have this chain of
events going on right now.

00:17:55.745 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:10%
It makes me-- It makes me sad
to think of the potential,

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:10%
as I said earlier, that it won't
be an option to actually come

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:10%
back and do this thing if
you're a conscious person.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.400 align:middle line:10%
On another level, is there
perhaps a polarization that's

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:10%
occurring, where you
have people who are super

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:10%
conscious and aware right
now, taking good care,

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:10%
raising their kids like
Edward Group's little kids,

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:10%
no vaccines, no nothing,
just healthy, little sparkly

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:10%
beings-- and there are
really hundreds of thousands,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:10%
if not millions of them
around the planet--

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:10%
that the species
continues on in one way

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:10%
that direction by those who are
consciously aware and taking

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:10%
care.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:10%
But then you have
the vast majority

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:10%
of people who really
have succumbed

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:10%
to the dullness of
what's been exerted.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Very true.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm an optimist for
human civilization.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that even
though, in the short term,

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
we are headed for
many different crises,

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
environmental, heavy
metals pollution

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
of the food supply, which is
another area that I'm actually

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
focused on and
researching a lot,

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and how that impacts
brain function.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But we are in one sense
destroying the physical planet;

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.925 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, the
backlash is a mass awakening.

00:19:10.925 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And the mass awakening
is accelerating through

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.691 align:middle line:84%
so many different channels,
including what Gaiam is doing,

00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:90%
What you're doing.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think we are going to
have a complete loss of what,

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.792 align:middle line:84%
I should say, the
awareness middle class.

00:19:25.792 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
There are going to be those
who are super conscious, as you

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:84%
said, super aware, and who
are-- who have their souls

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:84%
are able to interface
well with their brains

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to
exercise clear thinking.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to have
the majority, the masses, who

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:90%
are poisoned.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%
And they are victims.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are victims, yes.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.664 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the word victim.

00:19:48.664 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I know.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.454 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But, in fact, if
you haven't had exposure

00:19:51.454 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:10%
for whatever reason to
alternative information,

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:10%
then you have no way to
make decisions differently.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.081 align:middle line:10%
It really, truly is about
the expansion of awareness.

00:20:02.081 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: You're exactly right.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And these people, they
are being poisoned

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:90%
from so many different angles.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And not just the
chemical poisons,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:90%
but information poison.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Disinfo.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Being told these myths.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I just learned
today, by the way,

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that a famous Hollywood
actress, Angelina Jolie,

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
just completed a preventive
double mastectomy.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.100 align:middle line:90%
She has no cancer.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my God.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: She had both breasts
removed because her mother died

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:84%
from cancer, and she
has the BRCA1 gene.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And so she believed a
myth that a genetic code

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
means you're going
to have this disease.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:10%
She needed to read
books by Bruce Lipton.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.517 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:48.517 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:10%
I've known Bruce for years.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Epigenetics,
gene expression.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And look, she's
at the top level of society

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:10%
on a socioeconomic
level and still

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:10%
didn't have the
adequate information

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.914 align:middle line:10%
to make a healthy
decision for herself.

00:21:01.914 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: That's Right.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:10%
And she's a spokesperson,
practically,

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:10%
for the United Nations.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:84%
She's a model-- I don't
mean a supermodel.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean an example
for many women.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:90%
She's a symbol of femininity.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So look at that.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.589 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens when your
symbol has made this choice.

00:21:20.589 --> 00:21:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, you have to look
at why did she make the choice,

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to get
into more conspiracy theory,

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:90%
but, yes.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to condemn
anyone for making a choice,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:84%
but she thought obviously, it
was the best choice for her.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's just an
example of the way

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that people buy
into disinformation,

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and people are so easily
controlled by fear.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
This was a fear-based
decision for sure.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
In truth, if she
eats the right foods

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and she nourishes her
body in the right way,

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that BRCA gene will
never be expressed.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
but the agenda is

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:10%
to continue this
kind of surgery.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is an agenda.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Oh, yeah.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.391 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I know
other women who have

00:21:57.391 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:10%
done the same, where one
was affected, cut off both.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:10%
When you have someone at that
level saying, hey, it's OK.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:10%
I'll have prosthetics
put in and it's all

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.970 align:middle line:10%
going to be fine in the end.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:10%
That sends a very large
ripple through the community

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:10%
at large that this is
an OK thing to do now,

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:10%
which suits the medical
industry just fine.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:18.995 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Well, and
I want to mention

00:22:18.995 --> 00:22:20.430 align:middle line:10%
that this is going
to be controversial,

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:10%
but I'm going to lay
it out for you here.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:22.681 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, do.

00:22:22.681 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: The cancer industry
is dominated by men.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:22:25.465 --> 00:22:27.548 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: The medical
industry is dominated by men.

00:22:27.548 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:84%
They are happy to
recommend that women

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
have their breasts
removed, but you'll

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
notice they never
recommend that men

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:84%
who have a gene for possible
prostate cancer or testicular

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.630 align:middle line:90%
cancer remove their testicles.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.135 align:middle line:90%
This will never happen.

00:22:43.135 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It'll never happen.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: In the cancer industry.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:50.405 align:middle line:84%
You'll never have men going
on the news saying, hey,

00:22:50.405 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I removed my testicles.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm such a wonderful man.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.224 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
have cancer anymore.

00:22:55.224 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Never going to happen.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Never going to happen.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:10%
We're giggling about it
because the whole thing

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:10%
is so atrocious.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you have to laugh
because this is atrocious

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:10%
that she chose to do that
and let the world know.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:10%
This is such a horrid signal
to the women of the world.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:10%
But there you go.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:10%
That's part of it.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:10%
That's part of the
media glitch that's

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:10%
happening right now in
our brains, in our auras,

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:10%
our entire energy system.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: With that-- this is
crucial to know-- the idea

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that your DNA is a biochemical
and physical blueprint.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that your
DNA is a blueprint

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
for death and disease, that's
a very dangerous meme right

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
there because it means
you are born defective.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And that the only way
you can be healthy

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:84%
is to have intervention
through chemical intervention,

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
pharmacology, or
surgical intervention

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:84%
through surgeons, like
Jolie chose to do.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe
that actually we're

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
born with the perfect
blueprint for perfect health.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And that we are designed to
be perfectly healthy beings,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and all we have to do is
activate those segments of DNA

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:90%
that are already built in there.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, your immune system
is the most miraculous example

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
of nanotechnology that has
ever been observed anywhere

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:90%
in the known universe.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
No scientists for
any drug company

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:84%
can even create something as
simple as a red blood cell,

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:84%
but your body does it
millions of times a day

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:90%
without even thinking about it.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system
creates these things.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system
recognizes and builds

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
a database of foreign
invaders, stores that database,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and uses that to
keep you healthy

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:84%
even when you're
not aware of it.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:24:42.845 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just miraculous.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It's miraculous.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to do is learn
how to express or unleash

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:84%
the genetic code
that you already

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:84%
have that says you're
built to be a perfectly

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.549 align:middle line:84%
healthy, happy
productive human being.

00:24:59.549 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And from my
understanding the way

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:10%
it's going to go,
for those who are

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:10%
able to protect this in
their own DNA lineage,

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:10%
we are going to be
living more like 120,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.177 align:middle line:10%
130 years in the
very near future.

00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.051 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're really
headed that direction now.

00:25:13.051 --> 00:25:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I think that the
DNA is designed for us

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to live much longer
than we do today.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:10%
But even if a
lifespan is limited,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.380 align:middle line:10%
and a human life span is
short, even if it's 120,

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:10%
that's still plenty of time to
explore the spiritual truths

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.994 align:middle line:10%
and to go through the
exercise, THE learning

00:25:35.994 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:10%
that I think we're intended
to go through when we're here.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:39.719 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:10%
So now that we've had that
lovely discussion, which I--

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Sorry to get
way off track with you.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.586 align:middle line:10%
Are you kidding?

00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm right there with you.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Oh, good.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We could go
that direction for hours.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:10%
So, because we've promised
to talk about fluoride,

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:10%
we'll now start going back
into the fluoride story

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:10%
because there's
another part of this.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:10%
The whole-- I've
talked about this

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:10%
in other interviews, some
fabulous information on autism.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:10%
A woman working with Bill
Tiller on a consciousness level

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.090 align:middle line:10%
with autism, which we'll be
doing in another week or so.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:10%
But, let's talk about
fluoride and autism,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.264 align:middle line:10%
and also the subject
of lowered IQ.

00:26:11.264 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Oh, OK.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's start
with lowered IQ.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of good solid
research links high intake

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.940 align:middle line:90%
of fluoride with impaired IQ.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And that research, by
the way, was done mostly

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
on water wells in China and
throughout Asia, Southeast

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Asia as well, that had high
levels of naturally occurring

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:90%
fluoride.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's showing that even
quote "natural" fluoride can

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:84%
impair your IQ and impede brain
function and brain development.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the synthetic
chemical versions

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
of fluoride, how much more
toxic those really are.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
There's this tendency for people
to think that if something

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
comes out of the ground,
it's quote "natural"

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and therefore it
must be good for you.

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
dangerous thought,

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:90%
very dangerous false meme.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of things
that come out of the wells--

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Arsenic.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.716 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: -that are
very dangerous.

00:27:11.716 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Arsenic.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Cadmium, for example.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
the cadmium has

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:84%
a half life in your
body of about 25 years.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Whatever cadmium you intake
today, half of that's

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:90%
still there 25 years later.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And cadmium causes kidney
disease and kidney failure,

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and bone disorders, and
so many other things.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, decades ago they found
cadmium was very high in rice

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.410 align:middle line:84%
in Japan and people were dying
from a disease-- they even

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.225 align:middle line:84%
had a name for it,
I forgot the name.

00:27:39.225 --> 00:27:41.100 align:middle line:84%
They didn't realize it
was cadmium poisoning.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
That's because there
was a mine nearby

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.191 align:middle line:84%
where they were pulling
rocks out of the ground

00:27:45.191 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and the cadmium was getting
washed into the water that

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
was then feeding the rice,
which grows in water.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.020 align:middle line:10%
So the rice was
very high in cadmium

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:10%
and it was poisoning all
these Japanese workers

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.640 align:middle line:10%
who were working the fields.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And so,
all these things

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:84%
that come out of
the ground, these

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:84%
are called inorganic forms
of metals, rocks, elements,

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:90%
whatever the case may be.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Inorganic forms.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Your body doesn't
want inorganic forms.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Your body wants organic forms.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And I mean organic from a
molecular point of view.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:10%
Not organic as in USDA
certified organic farming.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.905 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people know that
chromium is very important.

00:28:21.905 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a trace mineral for
regulating blood sugar.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Diabetics are often
deficient in chromium.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
don't know that chromium

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
comes in basically two different
forms, two chemical forms.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:84%
There's hexavalent chromium,
sometimes called chromium-6,

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:90%
which is a toxin.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It is extremely toxic.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.085 align:middle line:84%
And then there's trivalent
chromium, chromium-3,

00:28:44.085 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
which is the trace
mineral that's

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.900 align:middle line:84%
essential for blood
sugar control.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So you've get chromium in these
different isotopes essentially,

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and someone who doesn't know
the difference might say,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:90%
well, chromium is good.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Or someone who's studying
environmental pollution

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.460 align:middle line:90%
might say, well, chromium's bad.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Chromium is terrible.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.490 align:middle line:10%
That's because there's
different forms of chromium.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.972 align:middle line:10%
The same thing's
true with mercury.

00:29:03.972 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:10%
There's methyl mercury.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:10%
There's ethyl mercury.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:10%
In arsenic, there's organic
and inorganic arsenic.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes you might have a
ratio of 2/3 inorganic arsenic

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:10%
in rice versus 1/3
organic arsenic in rice.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.405 align:middle line:90%
The organic arsenic is harmless.

00:29:18.405 --> 00:29:20.850 align:middle line:90%
The inorganic arsenic is poison.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.939 align:middle line:90%
So what's the difference?

00:29:21.939 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I'm getting at here.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to just throw out
a bunch of elemental analysis.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:84%
The point is that plants, plants
take poisons and turn them

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:90%
into nutrients.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.385 align:middle line:84%
So what's the difference
between the poisonous arsenic

00:29:38.385 --> 00:29:41.670 align:middle line:84%
or the poisonous chromium
and the healthy version?

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.714 align:middle line:84%
Normally it's that plants
transform it, living systems.

00:29:45.714 --> 00:29:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
about you, but I

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.230 align:middle line:84%
believe that plants have
some level of consciousness.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.834 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Trees are conscious
beings, just not mammals.

00:29:55.834 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Families of trees.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.290 align:middle line:10%
Well, we could go
on about that, too.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
thoughts on that.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I think they
have perhaps less complex

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:90%
consciousness than we do.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying a tree has
the same neurology as a human

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.810 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:08.352 align:middle line:10%
But I think--

00:30:08.352 --> 00:30:10.393 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But they have
collective and individual

00:30:10.393 --> 00:30:11.890 align:middle line:10%
consciousness and
learn together.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:12.270 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.100 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely agree.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And they sense and
they experience,

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:90%
a tree experiences things.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So plants have this
almost magical ability

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.550 align:middle line:84%
to take poisons and turn
them into nutrients.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And so many of
these metals that we

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
know of as nutrients, like
zinc, for example, magnesium,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
manganese even, trace elements,
these are all toxic metals

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.190 align:middle line:84%
if you dig them up
out of the ground.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
You let plants process them
and then you eat the plants.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly these become
life-saving nutrients

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that are bioavailable, that
have the right chemistry

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
for the body that have healthy
brains, healthy immune systems

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I know getting back
to fluoride, this myth

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that just because fluoride
occurs naturally in some wells

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.202 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that we're supposed
to add fluoride to our water

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to bring it up to
the level that it

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.670 align:middle line:84%
is in the wells
where it's toxic.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.420 align:middle line:10%
It makes no sense.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.086 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No, it
doesn't make any sense.

00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:20.790 align:middle line:10%
And you know, when we're looking
at the hidden sources of it,

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.970 align:middle line:10%
so many people now have
gotten onto the notion you

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:10%
can eat this agribusiness
food anymore.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.900 align:middle line:10%
GMOs, a lot of other things.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.580 align:middle line:10%
They've just depleted the lands.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.820 align:middle line:10%
The nutrients aren't there.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.010 align:middle line:10%
Trace minerals aren't there.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:10%
So we grow our little
organic backyard gardens.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:10%
But often if we're doing this,
for example, in the suburbs

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:43.350 align:middle line:10%
or in the city, we're using
fluoridated water supplies,

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:10%
so let's talk about
that for a minute.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.150 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: It's done on
a massive scale too.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Fluoridated water is used
in conventional agriculture.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that the potency

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
of the fluoride in the water
that you put on a garden,

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:01.130 align:middle line:84%
it's diluted a
lot and the plants

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:84%
help reduce the toxicity
of that through some amount

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.950 align:middle line:84%
of transformation, like
what we just talked about,

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:90%
but it is there.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And what goes along
with the fluoride often

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.895 align:middle line:90%
is trace levels of heavy metals.

00:32:13.895 --> 00:32:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, plants can actually
concentrate the heavy metals

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and not all of them
get transformed.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
This is why rice has both
organic and inorganic arsenic.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Only some of it can
get transformed.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Now every plant has
a different array

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:90%
of metals that it will absorb.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.935 align:middle line:84%
Some plants are
actually what are

00:32:34.935 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:90%
called bioremediation plants.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have, let's say, too
much mercury on your land,

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.441 align:middle line:84%
you plant all these
certain types of plants

00:32:41.441 --> 00:32:42.804 align:middle line:90%
and they pull the mercury out.

00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you can take
the plant somewhere else

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and your soil is
relatively mercury free.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But if that happens
to be your tomatoes,

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:54.090 align:middle line:84%
then you're eating
mercury-enhanced tomatoes

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:55.814 align:middle line:90%
fortified with extra mercury.

00:32:55.814 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And there is no form of
mercury that's good for you,

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:10%
All forms are bad.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.749 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You know, that's
an interesting thing.

00:33:01.749 --> 00:33:03.920 align:middle line:10%
I mean, again, we can go
on all these tangents,

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:10%
but I find them interesting.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.940 align:middle line:10%
When you're looking at the
bioengineering of seeds

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.040 align:middle line:10%
and foods, do you know of
any kind of bioengineering

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:10%
that would actually create
that kind of harmful effect?

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:10%
Where it would take a plant
that normally does not

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.220 align:middle line:10%
do bioremediation in
a really strong way

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.300 align:middle line:10%
and take something
that's heavily consumed

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.434 align:middle line:10%
and have it start pulling up
an odd array of heavy metals?

00:33:28.434 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Oh, that's
very possible.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Is that being
engineered or done?

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: No, I don't
think that's being

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.036 align:middle line:90%
engineered right now.

00:33:34.036 --> 00:33:34.827 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, good.

00:33:34.827 --> 00:33:39.266 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: But there are a lot
of labs that are being set up.

00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact,
because I know

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
some of the people involved
in this, that companies

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:49.210 align:middle line:84%
like DuPont are building
massive numbers of greenhouses

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.157 align:middle line:84%
at different locations
for experiments

00:33:51.157 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to experiment with
all kinds of things

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
need to disclose.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.542 align:middle line:10%
So there may be
experiments on absorption--

00:33:57.542 --> 00:33:58.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's what--

00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: -modifications.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.511 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: -I'm wondering.

00:34:00.511 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: There may be.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And those companies might
say-- if it does go public,

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.990 align:middle line:84%
they might say, well,
we're doing this just

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.420 align:middle line:90%
for bioremediation purposes.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.517 align:middle line:84%
We want to help
clean up toxic soils.

00:34:11.517 --> 00:34:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And that might be
their public excuse.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.183 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You could also
say a public excuse could

00:34:15.183 --> 00:34:19.040 align:middle line:10%
be, we're looking to
help reintroduce more

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.760 align:middle line:10%
of the trace minerals
into the diet.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:10%


00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:26.050 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot of ways to
introduce that information.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:10%
I have to say, one of the
most embarrassing moments

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:34.920 align:middle line:10%
in my career was 20 years ago
when I was used as a shill,

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.476 align:middle line:10%
unknowingly.

00:34:36.476 --> 00:34:37.850 align:middle line:10%
It was called "The
Envir Report."

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:39.308 align:middle line:10%
I was doing an
environmental report

00:34:39.308 --> 00:34:43.760 align:middle line:10%
for home use and understanding,
foods and the things

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:10%
we clean with and so forth.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.949 align:middle line:10%
1992 actually, more
than 20 years ago.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:51.889 align:middle line:10%
And I got called in by UCD,
University of California

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:55.300 align:middle line:10%
at Davis, to do this special
report on this brand new tomato

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.460 align:middle line:10%
that lasts longer on the shelf.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't
understand the concept.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.530 align:middle line:10%
I knew some basic
environmental stuff,

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:10%
it's a learning curve thing.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:10%
And I think I was one
of the first reporters

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:10%
to actually do a little piece
on the loveliness of the Flavr

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:10%
Savr tomato and this
long shelf life.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.660 align:middle line:10%
And it didn't take long
to figure that out.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.332 align:middle line:10%
I was so embarrassed later.

00:35:17.332 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Well, no need
to be embarrassed.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.700 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy for us to be
influenced by these promises.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.510 align:middle line:10%
If you look at
science-- and when

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.370 align:middle line:10%
I say science, what I
mean today is really

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.800 align:middle line:10%
corporate driven science.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:10%
I don't mean actual
real science,

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:10%
which is the humble
act of asking

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.420 align:middle line:10%
for answers from the universe.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
corporate driven science--

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.834 align:middle line:84%
it's always marketed
as a benefit.

00:35:39.834 --> 00:35:41.375 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make
your life better.

00:35:41.375 --> 00:35:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Better living through chemistry.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
see, I didn't even

00:35:43.696 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
know that disinformation
back then.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.870 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, I had no idea
that we were being lied to.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I did get the
fluoride picture, but not

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:90%
much else, honestly.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It's because of
people like yourself

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that this explosion of
knowledge is happening

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.440 align:middle line:84%
so that we can even begin
to evaluate any of this.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.420 align:middle line:84%
No one was doing
shows like yours then.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, look, I was
in the same boat as you.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't wake up until maybe
a little over a decade ago

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.392 align:middle line:90%
and start really questioning.

00:36:10.392 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think part
of that reason was

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.097 align:middle line:84%
because I was raised
on processed foods,

00:36:15.097 --> 00:36:15.805 align:middle line:90%
and antibiotics--

00:36:15.805 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Velveeta
cheese sandwiches.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: -and vaccines.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I was vaccinated as a child.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:84%
All these things--
pesticides on the lawn--

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:84%
all these things that I
didn't know any better

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and my family didn't
know any better.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing the best job
that they knew to raise a child

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and feed that child
the best they could.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.579 align:middle line:84%
But there's no way
that they could know.

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Just like today.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Here's a massively
fascinating fact

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:84%
that no one else
is talking about,

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.850 align:middle line:84%
since we're on the
subject of metals

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and interfering
with brain function.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:50.985 align:middle line:84%
You're probably familiar
with Prop 65 in California.

00:36:50.985 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:84%
It has very stringent
limits on the levels

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:84%
of metals
contamination, but only

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:84%
in herbs and
supplements and water.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.462 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that food can have
unlimited contamination.

00:37:01.462 --> 00:37:02.253 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, gosh.

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:03.200 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize that.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.866 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yeah, it
doesn't apply to food.

00:37:04.866 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't apply to food at all.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.130 align:middle line:10%
Turns out that the USDA
organic certification

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:14.652 align:middle line:10%
has no limit and no testing of
the levels of lead, mercury,

00:37:14.652 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:10%
arsenic, and cadmium
that's in your food.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You are kidding me.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.310 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I'm not kidding.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So just pesticides,
herbicides, fungicides.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Not even that.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:10%
USDA doesn't test the
level of these things.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:29.790 align:middle line:84%
USDA certifies a process
of farming, not a result.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.270 align:middle line:90%
A process only.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of food
that's grown in China

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:84%
is certified
organic by the USDA.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It's grown on farms that are
adjacent to chemical factories

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that are pushing out
mercury, cadmium, lead

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:47.590 align:middle line:84%
into the fields that's being
taken up by the plants, that's

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:50.450 align:middle line:90%
being imported into the USA.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:53.185 align:middle line:84%
The FDA only inspects 1%
to 2% of the food imports,

00:37:53.185 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:90%
and it tests even fewer.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So these foods are heavily
contaminated with heavy metals,

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and being sold as USDA
organic at health food stores

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.897 align:middle line:84%
and healthy grocers all
across this country right now.

00:38:06.897 --> 00:38:08.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, I think
most people watching

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.456 align:middle line:10%
this have kind of gotten
the China message on food.

00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:12.080 align:middle line:10%
Don't go there.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:10%
Don't go to China for
your food supplies.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.310 align:middle line:10%
However, let's look
at the implications,

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:20.450 align:middle line:10%
as you say, with the details
that we may have neglected

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:10%
to see in Prop 65 in California.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.350 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean for
the rest of the country?

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.730 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean for
the agricultural business

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:10%
in terms of organics even?

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.210 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I know you
have borderline.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.930 align:middle line:10%
When you have Walmart starting
to carry cheap organics,

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.230 align:middle line:10%
you know that some legislation
has been tampered with

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and the standards have
probably been lowered.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:40.940 align:middle line:10%
I get that.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.596 align:middle line:10%
Yet, some people
would argue, hey,

00:38:42.596 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:10%
at least it's a bump up from
what they were doing before.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:10%
And everyone has to argue
that out on their own.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:10%
But that said, where
do we start getting

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:55.020 align:middle line:10%
truly healthful, in their
normal spectrum of nutrients,

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.756 align:middle line:10%
food now?

00:38:56.756 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unless you do grow your
own with non-fluoridated water.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: The answer
is aquaponics.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
The answer is growing
in your own greenhouse.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I like the
aquaponic technology

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.790 align:middle line:84%
because it is the closest
thing to real nature

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.000 align:middle line:84%
that you can do
in your own home.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.010 align:middle line:84%
You could even do it on a
small scale in an apartment.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.550 align:middle line:90%
If you have a small yard, easy.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
greenhouse, even better.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.410 align:middle line:84%
But you can grow
high-density nutrition.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And here's the best
part about aquaponics.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go into
all the details of it

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.440 align:middle line:84%
because I know that's
not your topic today.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, just give
us a thumbnail sketch

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.326 align:middle line:90%
of how it works.

00:39:27.326 --> 00:39:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, it's fish in a
tank, a large tank, sometimes

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.110 align:middle line:90%
300 gallons.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's food in grow beds.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:40.320 align:middle line:84%
The fish, they provide the
nutrients to feed the plants,

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:84%
but it's transformed by worms
and bacteria, by the way.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's a whole ecosystem.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.552 align:middle line:84%
And then the plants clean
the water for the fish.

00:39:49.552 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's really
a beautiful system.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It's a great system.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.272 align:middle line:84%
Fish will die if they
have too much ammonia

00:39:54.272 --> 00:39:56.313 align:middle line:84%
in the water, which
typically happens if you just

00:39:56.313 --> 00:39:57.110 align:middle line:90%
have a fish tank.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:58.610 align:middle line:84%
You have to clean
out the fish tank.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.750 align:middle line:90%
It's an artificial system.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Plants will die if they
don't have enough nutrition,

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:84%
essentially, so you have to
always feed them nutrients.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you get too much salt
buildup if you're feeding them

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:09.950 align:middle line:90%
chemical nutrients and so on.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So by themselves,
both of these systems

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.510 align:middle line:84%
fail, or they're
high maintenance.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.241 align:middle line:90%
Together they clean each other.

00:40:17.241 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:90%
They nourish each other.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a synergistic system.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
best part about it.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are aware
of certain nutrients that

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:84%
are missing in the
soils, such as selenium.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Selenium, there's
an enormous amount

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:84%
of research showing
that selenium

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
is crucial for not only
brain function, preventing

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's disease, but
also for normal regular cell

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.210 align:middle line:90%
division, i.e.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.707 align:middle line:90%
cancer prevention.

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Selenium is crucial
for that, but it's

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:47.185 align:middle line:90%
missing in most of the foods.

00:40:47.185 --> 00:40:48.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you get selenium
into your diet?

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.285 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could buy
selenium supplements,

00:40:51.285 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:90%
and that's a great choice.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But the best way would be
to take selenium supplements

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and feed them to an
aquaponics system

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.180 align:middle line:84%
where have selenium
circulating in your water,

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.562 align:middle line:90%
so all your plans are uptaking--

00:41:02.562 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So much
more intelligent.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: -the selenium.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's also a lot cheaper.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Naturally mineralizing
your plant sources again.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:09.861 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:41:09.861 --> 00:41:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.970 align:middle line:90%
You want magnesium.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:10%
You want natural iron
from your plants.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Can that be
introduced into aquaponics

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.746 align:middle line:10%
without damaging the
fish and having them

00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:18.870 align:middle line:10%
even healthier or heartier?

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.140 align:middle line:84%
You can't put elemental
iron into the system

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:84%
because at too high levels
it's toxic to the fish.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But you can do foliar sprays
of iron on the plants.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Selenium can circulate
throughout the system.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And other minerals can.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Like manganese, for
example, can circulate,

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:38.194 align:middle line:84%
and zinc, at certain
levels can circulate

00:41:38.194 --> 00:41:39.110 align:middle line:90%
throughout the system.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:44.190 align:middle line:10%
So the really smart people
today are researching ways

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:10%
to grow their own food and turn
their food into their mineral

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.330 align:middle line:10%
supplements.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That is
just such a cool way.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:10%
We haven't gone that far yet,
but we've talked about it.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.740 align:middle line:10%
And we just settled into
a new house, old house

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:01.731 align:middle line:10%
that we brought back, and that
is a really viable option.

00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:04.230 align:middle line:10%
If you have any land at all,
it doesn't take a lot of space.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.680 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Versus if you were
to put selenium

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.820 align:middle line:84%
on your soil in a
garden, 90% of that's

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:84%
going to get washed
out and not absorbed.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But selenium in an
aquaponics system

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:20.120 align:middle line:84%
gets 100% utilized because it's
a recirculating water system.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.840 align:middle line:90%
You're not losing the water.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's washing out.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you put
into that system

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.870 align:middle line:84%
gets concentrated
into the plants.

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:28.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced this is the key.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:84%
That people who are long
term survivors-- let's say,

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.664 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a
food collapse coming.

00:42:34.664 --> 00:42:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
genetic pollution.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
weather radicalization.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we have blights in
the citrus crops right now.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.820 align:middle line:84%
We have the bananas
that are being

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:84%
grown in Ecuador are all
subject to a disease that's

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.410 align:middle line:84%
killing them all because
there's no genetic diversity.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:50.201 align:middle line:90%
They're all clones.

00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:53.890 align:middle line:84%
All bananas are grown
from clones commercially.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.172 align:middle line:90%
All the same genetics.

00:42:55.172 --> 00:42:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We have all of these
things that are leading us

00:42:57.130 --> 00:42:59.201 align:middle line:84%
to a collapse of the
food supply, which

00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:00.575 align:middle line:84%
is one of these
short term crises

00:43:00.575 --> 00:43:02.510 align:middle line:90%
that I spoke about earlier.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But people who are going to
be able to survive and thrive

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.140 align:middle line:84%
through that are people
who have mastered

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.120 align:middle line:84%
the art of growing
their own medicine

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and food in high-density,
self-contained greenhouses

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and aquaponics systems.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the key technology.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.861 align:middle line:10%
And one thing you're
not going to introduce

00:43:20.861 --> 00:43:23.370 align:middle line:10%
is fluoride into your
aquaponics system.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.506 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: No fluoride
into the system.

00:43:25.506 --> 00:43:26.006 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:43:26.006 --> 00:43:30.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And if you don't mind,
this whole myth was created

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:10%
and basically, we bought it.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.910 align:middle line:10%
Because who wants
to have bad teeth?

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.570 align:middle line:10%
Who wants their kids to
have bad teeth, right?

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:40.340 align:middle line:10%
Talk about the reality
regarding fluoride and teeth.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:40.980 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.479 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:41.479 --> 00:43:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So dental fluorosis is
one of the main side

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.277 align:middle line:84%
effects of too much
fluoride, and you

00:43:46.277 --> 00:43:47.360 align:middle line:90%
see that in a lot of kids.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.127 align:middle line:84%
Their front teeth my
turn dark or black.

00:43:49.127 --> 00:43:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with white
spots all over them, too.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Mottling of the teeth.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride can be toxic in
relatively small levels.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Now there is some
evidence to show

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that the right kind of fluoride
can be useful topically only.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:84%
That if you rinse
your teeth with it

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and then spit it out, that
that may be beneficial.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
argument they've got.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.160 align:middle line:90%
But then why would you drink it?

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's say if you're trying
to put on sun lotion

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:84%
to block UV light
from your skin,

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.530 align:middle line:84%
well you wouldn't
drink the sunscreen.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It doesn't
make any sense.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:90%
If it's topical, it's topical.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.979 align:middle line:90%
It's not for ingestion.

00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's the best
argument they can make.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So fluoride
in toothpaste.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.592 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, if
you spit it out.

00:44:35.592 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm not a proponent
of fluoride in toothpaste.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying their
best argument is

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.000 align:middle line:84%
that it might be
useful topically.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, if you
have a high natural mineral

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:50.480 align:middle line:84%
diet from super foods
and organic foods,

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and you're not destroying your
teeth through processed junk

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.050 align:middle line:84%
foods, refined sugars,
and phosphoric acid,

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.360 align:middle line:84%
which is in all
sodas by the way.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes them acidic
is the phosphoric acid.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Stone masons use that to
etch patterns into rock.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:05.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.744 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
destroy your teeth.

00:45:07.744 --> 00:45:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your enamel.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.161 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:09.161 --> 00:45:11.659 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And the bacteria that
follow from the high fructose

00:45:11.659 --> 00:45:13.270 align:middle line:84%
corn syrup that's
also in the soda.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you just eat wisely
and don't destroy your teeth,

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.260 align:middle line:84%
you don't have an
issue with tooth enamel

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.162 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:45:21.162 --> 00:45:23.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And when you look at
the work of the Weston Price

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.000 align:middle line:10%
Foundation, for example.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.410 align:middle line:10%
I mean some of the work he did--
and this was a few decades ago

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:33.010 align:middle line:10%
now-- going into indigenous
regions of the world, the one

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.130 align:middle line:10%
common trait he found were these
beautiful, healthy white teeth.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.420 align:middle line:10%
These people do not sue
fluoride, obviously.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.253 align:middle line:10%
You're talking about
people that were living

00:45:40.253 --> 00:45:42.690 align:middle line:10%
very close to the land,
eating natural foods

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:47.550 align:middle line:10%
with natural compounds in
them, and healthy, beautiful

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:49.050 align:middle line:10%
straight white teeth.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.496 align:middle line:10%
Full mouths of teeth
even into later years.

00:45:51.496 --> 00:45:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: When you
say full mouths, too,

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.604 align:middle line:90%
you're exactly right about that.

00:45:54.604 --> 00:45:56.020 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that
in those photos

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:59.910 align:middle line:84%
from the book, "Nutrition
and Physical Degeneration,"

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.640 align:middle line:84%
the photos show large
mouths full of teeth.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.247 align:middle line:84%
And at first, you
might not notice it.

00:46:06.247 --> 00:46:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back and you
really do the research,

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.240 align:middle line:84%
you find out that
what's happening today,

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.590 align:middle line:84%
why so many people
have teeth crowding

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.680 align:middle line:84%
is because their jaw
line is being destroyed

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:84%
by the acids in what
they're drinking.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.910 align:middle line:84%
They're drinking such
acidic beverages, normally

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:24.390 align:middle line:84%
sodas, that it's
actually robbing

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.300 align:middle line:84%
the mineralization of their
entire skeletal system,

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:90%
especially the jawbone.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Then the jaw gets smaller
and the jaw gets sunken in,

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:35.450 align:middle line:84%
it actually shoots
back this direction,

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:39.000 align:middle line:84%
the mouth gets crowded,
the teeth get crowded.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm one of the few people
alive today, apparently,

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:90%
who has all my wisdom teeth.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.429 align:middle line:90%
It freaks dentists out.

00:46:45.429 --> 00:46:46.886 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No wonder
you're so wise.

00:46:46.886 --> 00:46:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Come on, no.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.558 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:46:48.558 --> 00:46:49.490 align:middle line:90%
It's an old joke.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Old joke.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.762 align:middle line:90%
But dentists freak out--

00:46:51.762 --> 00:46:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And they grew in straight.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: -when they
look in my mouth.

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:54.826 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they grew in straight.

00:46:54.826 --> 00:46:56.110 align:middle line:90%
No problems whatsoever.

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Dentists freak out.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:84%
They look at my
mouth and they say,

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen this many
teeth in one person's mouth.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a dentist about a decade
ago who saw it and said,

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.061 align:middle line:90%
those have to come out.

00:47:08.061 --> 00:47:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're fine
and functional and healthy.

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.500 align:middle line:84%
He's like you've got
to cut those teeth out.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Angelina
Jolie's surgeon now.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:18.820 align:middle line:90%
You've got to cut those out.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, Mr.-- I don't remember
his name-- you're insane.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.940 align:middle line:90%
I told him you're insane.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.570 align:middle line:84%
These are asymptomatic,
no symptoms, no problem,

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:29.970 align:middle line:90%
and they came in years ago.

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want to remove a
perfectly healthy set of teeth

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.032 align:middle line:90%
from my jawbone?

00:47:35.032 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even come
to you for that.

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted some
basic dental checkups.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.240 align:middle line:90%
These people are crazy.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:41.907 align:middle line:90%
They're insane.

00:47:41.907 --> 00:47:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to dentists
going insane-- by the way,

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying all
dentists are bad.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.660 align:middle line:84%
There are many great holistic
dentists that I love.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it's the
highest rate of suicide

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.470 align:middle line:84%
though, because
of the depression

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.040 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the
mercury, et cetera.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It's the mercury.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:53.545 --> 00:47:56.240 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
dentists, the insane ones

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.440 align:middle line:90%
are mercury poisoned.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.862 align:middle line:84%
Those amalgam fillings are more
than 50% mercury typically.

00:48:01.862 --> 00:48:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't warn them
about that in dental school.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And the mercury
poisoning that they get

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.010 align:middle line:84%
is also reflected in
what the patient gets.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:10%
So if you start putting together
all these toxins that we're

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.550 align:middle line:10%
talking about just today
in this short segment,

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.270 align:middle line:10%
you've got fluoride, which
is also a neurotoxin,

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:26.350 align:middle line:10%
you've got mercury, which
is a very potent neurotoxin,

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:29.160 align:middle line:10%
and then you've got
things that are injected

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.720 align:middle line:10%
into your tissues via vaccines.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let's go there.

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:35.545 align:middle line:10%
That kind of takes us right
back to Nazi Germany again,

00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:38.120 align:middle line:10%
I think, where we started
in this conversation, right.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So on vaccines, let me take
the most reserved point of view

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.930 align:middle line:84%
on this, and let's say,
for argument's sake,

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that I agree with
the doctors who

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.180 align:middle line:84%
say that vaccination
theory works.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.090 align:middle line:84%
That if you put a small amount
of a certain weakened virus

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:00.500 align:middle line:84%
into someone's body, they will
build antibodies in response

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.000 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.330 align:middle line:84%
It will be like a rehearsal
for the immune system,

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and then they will be
immune to the disease.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.110 align:middle line:10%
Now let's say
just, again, that I

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:10.410 align:middle line:10%
agree with that, which I
don't but we can pick that

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.460 align:middle line:10%
apart later, but let's
say I agree with that.

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Why would you then put into the
vaccine aluminum, a neurotoxin,

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:24.850 align:middle line:84%
MSG, a neurotoxin, formaldehyde,
a neurotoxin, and mercury,

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.790 align:middle line:84%
a neurotoxin, and all
four of these ingredients,

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:34.230 align:middle line:84%
by the way, are admitted by the
CDC on the government website.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:36.160 align:middle line:10%
You can go to the CDC,
you can pull it up.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.450 align:middle line:10%
We took a screen shot
of it, we captured it.

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:43.660 align:middle line:10%
They admit that mercury,
aluminum, MSG, and formaldehyde

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:10%
are still used in vaccines.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Why would you
inject into a child

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:53.542 align:middle line:84%
these substances at
any dose, any dose?

00:49:53.542 --> 00:49:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good question.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.833 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I don't care if
it's 1 part per trillion,

00:49:56.833 --> 00:49:57.820 align:middle line:10%
it's too much.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, they say, oh,
no, it's a preservative.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's a deadly
toxic preservative.

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:03.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:03.035 --> 00:50:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: That's how it kills
the bacteria in the solution.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.150 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The very thing that
is supposed to be active.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.720 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: So there's a movement
out there for something

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.570 align:middle line:10%
called "green" vaccines
or "clean" vaccines.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.560 align:middle line:84%
That would be a great
starting point to say,

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.200 align:middle line:84%
let's have single
dose vials that

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:84%
are not formulated with
mercury, aluminum, MSG,

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:29.260 align:middle line:90%
and formaldehyde.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Now the aluminum, by the way,
is not used as a preservative.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.910 align:middle line:10%
It's used as an adjuvant to
cause an inflammatory reaction,

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:37.940 align:middle line:10%
which is a whole other ballgame,
back that gets into autism.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.900 align:middle line:10%
But why wouldn't you
have clean vaccines

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.900 align:middle line:10%
if you were a vaccine
proponent and you

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.505 align:middle line:10%
cared about the
health of children?

00:50:46.505 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So when they say this
is about public health,

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.820 align:middle line:84%
we want to save children,
we want to help children,

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.480 align:middle line:90%
they're lying.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.320 align:middle line:84%
They're lying because
those vaccines contain

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.470 align:middle line:84%
four known neurotoxins that are
being injected into children

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:02.986 align:middle line:84%
and children are
having seizures,

00:51:02.986 --> 00:51:04.360 align:middle line:84%
they're going into
comas, they're

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:08.860 align:middle line:84%
having reactions that are
now being explained away.

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.400 align:middle line:84%
They're even saying
that seizures are now

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.930 align:middle line:84%
normal after your
child gets vaccinated.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't worry.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.320 align:middle line:10%
They're going to have
a little seizure.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, just
don't get me going.

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:17.905 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: It's normal.

00:51:17.905 --> 00:51:18.863 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: This is sick.

00:51:18.863 --> 00:51:19.510 align:middle line:10%
It's so sick.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.800 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: They might have a
fever, a seizure, crying,

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.500 align:middle line:10%
whatever.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.410 align:middle line:10%
And then they're going
to come out of it

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:25.618 align:middle line:10%
and they're going to be fine.

00:51:25.618 --> 00:51:26.950 align:middle line:10%
That's the new meme.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:31.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, and you write
about a fellow, Dr. Paul Offit.

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.930 align:middle line:10%
Whoa.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:35.760 align:middle line:10%
He made some incredibly
bold and incredibly ignorant

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.990 align:middle line:10%
statement, right?

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:40.700 align:middle line:10%
That a baby could handle
100,000 different elements

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:10%
in their vaccines.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:42.560 align:middle line:10%
A baby?

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.970 align:middle line:10%
And then he had to downsize it,
maybe he misspoke, to 10,000.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I'm actually going
to challenge Offit to--

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to offer
him $1 million

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.280 align:middle line:84%
if he will take
100,000 vaccine shots.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.190 align:middle line:90%
That's $10 a shot--

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:02.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Better yet, have
his grandchildren do it.

00:52:02.315 --> 00:52:03.398 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: -that's good pay.

00:52:03.398 --> 00:52:05.944 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have him administer
to his grandchildren.

00:52:05.944 --> 00:52:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: There you go.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.195 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine how much mercury
is in even just 1,000 vaccines?

00:52:10.195 --> 00:52:12.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But let's talk about
who this guy is, and let's

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.110 align:middle line:10%
talk about how he's
been compensated

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:15.010 align:middle line:10%
with Merck and all that.

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:17.385 align:middle line:10%
It's important to understand
how this information gets out

00:52:17.385 --> 00:52:17.885 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:21.227 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I really don't want
to get into any focus on Offit.

00:52:21.227 --> 00:52:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's get out of it then.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I think
he is an anti-human demon.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I literally believe--
look, I think some people,

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:35.680 align:middle line:84%
this is my opinion, I think
some people get taken over

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.340 align:middle line:90%
by demonic spiritual forces.

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With a
statement like his,

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.924 align:middle line:84%
that would be a
candidate for it.

00:52:41.924 --> 00:52:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And if you
look around society,

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:48.160 align:middle line:84%
in the UK there was a
famous DJ, Jimmy Savile.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Dark.

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: David Icke talked
about this guy for many years.

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Very dark individual.

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to pollute
this with all that talk.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at people
who are predators of children,

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and you see that in
the vaccine industry.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.230 align:middle line:84%
That's where you find
the literal demons.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's anti-life.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.540 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely
it's anti-life.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's anti-life
and I bring it up

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:14.550 align:middle line:10%
simply because he
works in collusion

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:17.730 align:middle line:10%
with a very large
pharmaceutical company.

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:21.590 align:middle line:10%
And these kinds of "studies,"
these kinds of statements

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:23.840 align:middle line:10%
from these "authorities"
are frequently

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.340 align:middle line:10%
coming from this
kind of individual.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.962 align:middle line:84%
You find-- well
again, I don't want

00:53:29.962 --> 00:53:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to go into too much of
that because it's really

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:32.930 align:middle line:90%
quite horrifying.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think on the
flip side of that,

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I feel like the mission
of people like you

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and I and others in this
realm, is really-- at least one

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.370 align:middle line:84%
of our main missions
here is to protect life.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:46.690 align:middle line:90%
To learn how to protect life.

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
To learn the importance
of protecting life,

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:55.180 align:middle line:84%
which means to grasp
the sacredness of life.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:58.260 align:middle line:84%
We're not just
inanimate minerals

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:02.590 align:middle line:84%
thrown together and
bound by carbon atoms.

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:05.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm with you 100%.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.850 align:middle line:10%
Every time I go into any
kind of deep reflection

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:12.250 align:middle line:10%
and connect out there, I'm
very hopeful for humanity.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:14.382 align:middle line:10%
In the end, I agree
100% also, I think

00:54:14.382 --> 00:54:16.090 align:middle line:10%
we have some bumps to
go through and this

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:19.530 align:middle line:10%
is where it gives us a chance
to exert our will and authority

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:21.700 align:middle line:10%
over ourselves and
our consciousness.

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:22.560 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the main lessons

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:30.880 align:middle line:84%
is for us to gain the maturity
to understand, number one, just

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.050 align:middle line:90%
how powerful each of us is.

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And then two, to exercise that
power with responsibility.

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:45.680 align:middle line:10%
So it's a scary
thing at one level

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.670 align:middle line:10%
to be a person of
influence, as both of us

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:51.390 align:middle line:10%
are in our own realms.

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:84%
People of influence,
people listen to us.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Others may attack
us, but that's fine.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But people share time with
us to learn some of the ideas

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:06.060 align:middle line:90%
that we might be sharing.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's important that when
you have that kind of influence,

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:15.590 align:middle line:84%
that you very carefully look
at yourself at what are you

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:17.160 align:middle line:90%
going after.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I attack certain ideas,
I expose certain things.

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I endorse and
support other ideas.

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So it means you have to
have very high skills

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:31.540 align:middle line:84%
of discernment, and to also
be immune to being manipulated

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:32.040 align:middle line:90%
or fooled.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:32.910 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned an
example earlier.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you bet.

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.662 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I've been tricked.

00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:35.370 align:middle line:90%
I've been fooled.

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.490 align:middle line:90%
I've been exploited.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:39.450 align:middle line:10%
To be able to discern
the difference

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:41.144 align:middle line:10%
is a great spiritual skill.

00:55:41.144 --> 00:55:41.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.780 align:middle line:10%
And we're about out
of time and I just

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.410 align:middle line:10%
want to say you do a lovely
job in your discernment,

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.970 align:middle line:10%
and it is a challenge for
everyone in this field.

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:51.428 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: And we're
always learning.

00:55:51.428 --> 00:55:52.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We're learning.

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.680 align:middle line:10%
And people in this field
are exposed and pressured

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.700 align:middle line:10%
a lot of different
ways, and it's

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.470 align:middle line:10%
important to
understand that it is

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:03.342 align:middle line:10%
through that connection and that
cleanliness of your own being

00:56:03.342 --> 00:56:05.050 align:middle line:10%
that allows you to
have that discernment.

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:06.900 align:middle line:10%
And fluoride, nyet.

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:07.400 align:middle line:10%
Nyet.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:07.983 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:56:07.983 --> 00:56:10.930 align:middle line:10%
You take fluoride out of your
life, your clarity skyrockets.

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:11.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.880 align:middle line:10%
And so on that
note, thank you so

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.850 align:middle line:10%
much for spending some
time with me on this.

00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:17.635 align:middle line:10%
It's been a very
elucidating conversation.

00:56:17.635 --> 00:56:18.070 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:19.445 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Well,
thank you, Regina.

00:56:19.445 --> 00:56:20.944 align:middle line:10%
It's my pleasure to join you.

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:22.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I hope this
has emboldened you

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:24.230 align:middle line:10%
into standing up
for both your rights

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:25.870 align:middle line:10%
and the rights of your kids.

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:28.570 align:middle line:10%
