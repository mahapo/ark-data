00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: While it's
been made abundantly clear

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:10%
that eating a variety
of plant-based foods

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:10%
is the path to good
health, we seem

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:10%
to forgotten all about
the legendary healing

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:10%
properties of the
plants' essences.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Aromatherapy is one of
Earth's greatest gifts

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to humanity for healing,
both our bodies, our minds,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:90%
our spirit, and our emotions.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And I feel very lucky
to be here, just

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:84%
outside of Sedona,
Arizona, with Barry

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Kapp at his
aromatherapy laboratory

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:90%
called Wisdom of the Earth.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:90%
It's been a few years.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And Barry, I'm so
happy to see you again.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.404 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I have to
say this is such a delight

00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:90%
being back here.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:10%
It's been a few years since
I've been to your lab,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:10%
and I still have a box full of
your wonderful essential oils.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:10%
And to me, it's one of the
most naturally healing ways

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:10%
to interface with
the plant kingdom,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:10%
to interface with nature.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
comes kind of natural to you

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's in
your family lineage.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us an idea of
your father, your mother,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:90%
and how this began for you.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRY KAPP: Sure.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.389 align:middle line:10%
Sure.

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to say it's
great to see you again,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:10%
and to see Scott.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:10%
It's been a long time.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:10%
So the back story of my life in
regardS to the plant and tree

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:10%
kingdom is I had a mother
who was very in tune

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:10%
with her favorite plants,
amongst others, roses.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:10%
And she is the one totally
instrumental in teaching me

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:10%
how to listen to them
when they speak to you

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.302 align:middle line:10%
and asking them
questions, and trusting

00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:10%
that they would
give you an answer.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:10%
So my mother has complete,
how would you say,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:10%
she's the complete package in
my life as far is giving me

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:10%
the profound awareness that
you can talk and listen.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:10%
Today it's not such a
big thing because people

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:10%
understand about talking.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:10%
You ask somebody can
you talk to your cat,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:10%
or will the cat talk
to you, and so forth.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:10%
But back in the day
when I was young,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:10%
this was still very, very new.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:10%
So this was a big thing
when I asked my mom

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:10%
if I could actually
ask this rose plant

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:10%
that she was teaching
me how to deadhead

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:10%
the branches for
the fall, if I would

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:10%
ask this plant a question,
this rose, would it answer me.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:10%
And it did.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.045 align:middle line:10%
I was about nine years old.

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Do you remember what
your very first experience

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:10%
was when you received an answer?

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.339 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: I do, but I don't
remember the question.

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:10%
All I remember is
that my mom said, son,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:10%
if you ask-- she was a Taurus--
if you ask a question it will

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.170 align:middle line:10%
answer you in it's own
time, but it will answer.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:10%
So what happened is that
I asked the question.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember
what it was anymore

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:10%
because it's been so many years.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.417 align:middle line:10%
And then the next
morning, I came out--

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:10%
we were deadheading
again, because she

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:10%
had close to 100 roses.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:10%
And you know I was nine years
old, I got home from school

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:10%
or it was during the summertime,
spring break, whatever,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.190 align:middle line:10%
even back then, Easter vacation.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:10%
And so I came down and out and
I got my snippers and my gloves

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:10%
and I said, mom, that
rose bush answered me.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:10%
And she got really still,
she had her back to me,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:10%
she turned around-- and she
was only five foot tall,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:10%
and I was a little bit
shorter than her still--

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:10%
and she put both of her
hands on my shoulder

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:10%
and looked me in
the eyes and said,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:10%
"Now, what that rose bush told
you, believe and don't you ever

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:10%
doubt her, ever."

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the most
profound experiences

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a gift.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: A mother that
I loved so dearly.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:10%
She taught me how
to love and trust

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:10%
Gaia, as well as the
plants and trees.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:10%
And so that's kind
of like the number

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:10%
one catalyst from my mother.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:10%
My father was a
self-taught herbalist.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:10%
He wore many hats.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:10%
He was very eccentric in some
of those hats for his day.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:10%
And he taught me how to
respect the trees and plants.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.000 align:middle line:10%
He taught me that-- this
was very profound for me,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:10%
just like my mother was
profound in what I just said.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:10%
He would tell me
over and over again

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:10%
that if I really desired
true wisdom, true knowledge,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:10%
true joy, and true
intellectualism,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:10%
it was to get to know Gaia.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:10%
And then if I was
willing to do that,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:10%
there would be no problem with
me understanding more and more

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:10%
about God.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Because Gaia teaches us
about Source, Creator, God,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:10%
however-- He, She,
whatever you label

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:10%
that which is the
Creator of all.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:10%
And so my father
gave me that gift.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:10%
And then the last piece,
I'll do three pieces,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:10%
he was from the west.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:10%
So I traveled many years
in an old '56 Dodge

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:10%
when I was young,
back and forth.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.990 align:middle line:10%
And all of his brothers were
in California, Utah, Fresno,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:10%
Salt Lake City.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.724 align:middle line:10%
So we went to Bryce
Canyon several times.

00:05:51.724 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Beautiful red
rocks that many people

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.289 align:middle line:10%
have seen in movies
and commercials.

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: Yeah.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:10%
And so I was on a hike one
time with him, just he and I,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:10%
mom stayed behind.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:10%
And we were tired, he
was tired and we rested.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:10%
And I was maybe 14 years old.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:10%
And my dad had been working
for the US government

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:10%
amongst other things,
so he was gone a lot.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:10%
I was a mama's boy.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:10%
So he said, I have something
I'd like to tell you.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:10%
And he said, before
you were born,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:10%
I had always asked Creator that
if I had a son at some point,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:10%
I would be so thankful that I
would give him back to Creator.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.700 align:middle line:10%
And so we had never had any
real conversation like this.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:10%
And he was a Cancer
astrologically,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:10%
so he kept a lot of things in.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:10%
And when he told me this, of
course it moved me to tears.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:10%
He was crying.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.129 align:middle line:10%
And he says, it's time.

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to give
you back to Creator

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:10%
because I love you so much.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:10%
So there was this initial
bonding that happened,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:10%
which had happened already
years before with my mother.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:10%
I loved my father, but
I was not close to him.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:10%
But this changed at that time.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:10%
And then he's told me one
profound in this last point.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:10%
He said, what I have taught
you, it's your choice.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:10%
But I know because of my
experiences that by the time

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:10%
you graduate from high school,
you will do one or two things.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:10%
You will trust
Mother Earth first,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.425 align:middle line:10%
just like your father does--
you will resonate and own this,

00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:10%
it won't be mine anymore-- and
humans second for your healing

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:10%
physically, emotionally
and spiritually.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:10%
Or you will do the other.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:10%
You will trust man first
and Gaia second, if at all.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:10%
So that's the back story.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And we've talked
about this off camera,

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:10%
that you feel a very deep sense
of purpose in your own life

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.720 align:middle line:10%
that you are here to bring
human beings together

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:10%
with Gaia through this
process of essential oils

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:10%
and hydrosols.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about blossoms,
and bark, and roots, and herbs

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into
this a little later,

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
this is something that you're
in regular daily communication

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:90%
with, and this is not woo woo.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:90%
It started at nine.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It's gone on your entire life.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You understand plants on a
very deep and unique level.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And you've shared this with
thousands of other people

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
who also heal this way and
facilitate, and now even teach.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
They are the voice
from the plant

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:90%
world to the human kingdom.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to say thank
you for putting plants first.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So now that we know a little
bit about your background,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
let's talk a little
bit about the plants

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:84%
themselves and the
world they're in,

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and how they reach out
to and interface with us.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: OK.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:90%
There's so much.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to stream this
from my heart and consciousness

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.186 align:middle line:84%
what they would
like for me to say.

00:09:03.186 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
back up just a moment

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
with what you said before
and kind of interface this.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:90%
I came here to this planet.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:10%
My contract and mission was
to be a messenger for Gaia

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:10%
and to hold space for her.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:10%
And we don't have
time to go into it,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:10%
and it's not necessarily
that important for everyone,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:10%
but it is important
on different levels

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:10%
that I came in within
hours as a volunteer.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
In other words, my
mother and father

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
made love just a few hours
after August the 9th,

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:84%
after Nagasaki was
bombed, the second.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:49.640 align:middle line:84%
August 3, 1945 was Hiroshima,
August 9th was Nagasaki.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of the
first volunteers.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
If you know anything about
Dolores Cannon's work,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
the books, she says,
the volunteers,

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I was one of those
first volunteers.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that, I
remember that in my contract.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
if we get to talk
about the Japanese,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the
reasons why I'm

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:84%
very close to that
whole culture.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was that I
answered the call, I came here.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
That is my contract,
to hold space

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:84%
for Gaia, the plant
and tree kingdom.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And then to interface
because I came in as a human

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to interface with
my fellow humans

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and to give them courage
that we must, at some point,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:84%
choose to get back
in harmony with Gaia.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And not the least being our
medicine and the nutrition that

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
comes from the pure
essential essences,

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
as well as the most
beautiful fragrances.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you think about we

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
can accept that you can go
around, pull up things and eat

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:90%
them, right?

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't have an
issue with that.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
science, there's

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of data on
the value of that.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet, aromatherapy
has been sidelined

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.890 align:middle line:84%
to kind of a feminine, woo woo
thing you might do for rituals

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.540 align:middle line:90%
or put a little scent on.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But it hasn't been given
in the mainstream at all.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.180 align:middle line:84%
It's due in terms
of its potency.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Yet, almost all the
pharmaceutical industry

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.735 align:middle line:84%
products are based on the
original workings of nature.

00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
in this area just

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:90%
to dwell on that one point.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Merck Pharmaceuticals
a number of years

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
ago did a compilation of some
of their original catalogs

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
dating back to the early,
I guess, '20s, '30s, I

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:90%
don't remember exactly.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing
but one essence,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
peppermint, garlic,
ginger, all mentioned

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and they used to
use the essences

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
without diluting
or adulterating.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, they made
a big, huge glitch

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
because they were so
enthused about their history,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
they forgot about what
was coming in relationship

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to the unraveling
and the renewal

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
in people's consciousness,
that the plant and tree

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.574 align:middle line:90%
kingdom is real.

00:12:22.574 --> 00:12:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was quite an
advertisement for aromatherapy

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.965 align:middle line:84%
for Merck to have
released that old data.

00:12:26.965 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: It was.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can't hardly
find one of those now.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.324 align:middle line:84%
You can't because
they pulled it.

00:12:31.324 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm not surprised.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.031 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: They pulled
it even though it

00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:39.590 align:middle line:84%
was for one of their 50th, or
75th, or 100th anniversary.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually a pharmaceutical
man, doctor actually,

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:90%
told me about this.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.630 align:middle line:90%
And so that's one thing.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is that as
all of use are waking up,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
we are questioning
everything, which

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:84%
is a good thing if
we're in our hearts.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.342 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that within

00:13:00.342 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
the medicinal aromatherapy
literature through the years,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.580 align:middle line:90%
it's like anything else.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Many, I would say--
I'm going to have

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to be very plain and blunt,
most of the literature out there

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that has even been written,
even in the last 25 years,

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
is fear-based about
medicinal aromatherapy.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It's based on the
programmings that

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
have come through the
allopathic philosophy,

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and that is what still moves
this country called the United

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:90%
States of America.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:84%
We must understand, though, that
at least up to five years ago,

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:84%
the United States of
America is the only country

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that is high-tech
that has ever permitted

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:84%
one philosophical idea of health
to dominate and to control,

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and also be funded
by the government

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
in many different
ways to be the only

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
real spokesman for the
health and well-being

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of the human family.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
If you go to France,
as an example,

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
in order to get your
medical MD license,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
you have to major in allopathic,
but you have to have a second.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you a
story of a doctor who

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
was one of the senior vice
presidents of SmithKline

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Pharmaceutical outside
of Pennsylvania,

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.485 align:middle line:84%
and he found me as a
medicinal aromatherapist.

00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.790 align:middle line:10%
And he said, the
reason why I found

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:43.830 align:middle line:10%
you is because I knew
when I had my second major

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:10%
in medicinal aromatherapy,
this is what I would use

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:10%
for my body and my health,
but I would make my money

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.344 align:middle line:10%
in the pharmaceutical.

00:14:54.344 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:10%
Very, very bright man.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That was very
direct and honest of him

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:10%
to even share that.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.813 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:58.813 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I treated him for two years
before he left the country,

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:90%
and I will leave it at that.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you see this when
you're in France and England

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and the other
countries, Germany,

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you'll often see wherever you
have a pharmacy or a chemist

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot, you'll also see the
homeopathy symbol in the window

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.245 align:middle line:84%
And the chemist will sell
both homeopathic remedies,

00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
they'll sell essences, and
they'll sell pharmaceuticals.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't see that
in this country.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So that makes your work, A, more
necessary and more profound;

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:84%
but, B, you're up against
the establishment in a sense,

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
but the people themselves
are coming around,

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.780 align:middle line:90%
as I said earlier.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:84%
You've taught
thousands of people

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
about how to use these
essences and such by now.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: When I got
an email from someone

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.322 align:middle line:84%
that was walking the China
Wall and they smelled Wisdom

00:15:52.322 --> 00:15:53.780 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth essences
and then they

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
saw someone walking by
with one of our bottles,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.955 align:middle line:90%
I said, we've gone global now.

00:15:58.955 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
As small as we
are, we're global.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.826 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just mention
about one other back story

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:05.575 align:middle line:84%
of the history of
medicinal aromatherapy--

00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:06.408 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please do.

00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: -and one of the
conundrums that we face.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:10%
First of all, it's
a lot of the books--

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.365 align:middle line:10%
and it is true that the
Egyptians were very famous

00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:10%
in medicinal aromatherapy.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, it goes
way back even further.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, today, we have total
evidence and documentation

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:84%
that medicinal aromatherapy
dates all the way back

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.870 align:middle line:84%
to the earliest known
civilization that

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:84%
has been written
about, studied about,

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and the tablets are
still being decoded,

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
Sumerian civilization.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:84%
That's over 9,000 to
10,000 years plus.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:10%
On an oral tradition,
because of many, many issues,

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:10%
I was with a shamanistic
woman a few years ago

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:10%
doing a ceremony with a tour
with Drunvalo Melchizedek

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:10%
in the Easter Island area
and the Island of Moorea.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:10%
And when we were on
Easter Island, Ruth,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:10%
is her name, first
name, I asked her

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:10%
about the essences
of kanuka and manuka

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:10%
that we get from the
reservation of the Maori natives

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:10%
in New Zealand.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I understand--

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking about
the blossom or the honey,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:90%
or what?

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: The actual essence
of the kanuka and manuka.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:90%
Coming from-- it's a shrub.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It has whitish red flowers and
it likes to grow around lakes.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And most
people have heard of it

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.660 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
honey making its way

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
into the foreground
of our consciousness

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and the healing properties
of manuka honey.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:90%
So, let's hear the rest.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:41.316 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Exactly.

00:17:41.316 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Both-- there's like
sisters, manuka, kanuka.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I asked Ruth, I
said, how old do you

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
feel, because she's from
the Waitaha Nation, which

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
is even older and was all
matriarchal before the Maori.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Many, many ages ago.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.086 align:middle line:84%
And she says, when we
were walking by the moai,

00:18:03.086 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
she said, how about 35,000 to
45,000 years in oral tradition

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
for the use ceremonially,
medicinally, and spiritually,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.134 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally of
manuka and kanuka.

00:18:16.134 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: And I just--
my mouth dropped open.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you kidding me?

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:90%
She said, yeah, it's that old.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:90%
It's that old.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.280 align:middle line:10%
And we have songs about
it, ancient, ancient songs.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of the thing.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Now to couple that
with why is it--

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:84%
like, so many people
come to us and say,

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
how come I don't know about
medicinal aromatherapy?

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:84%
How come the government doesn't
support this, fund this?

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And many other such like
questions towards us.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, one of
the issues that's still

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
wreaking havoc is that you'll
notice a lot of the books

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.464 align:middle line:84%
are British sisters who
have written books on this.

00:19:03.464 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the first
interview I did on aromatherapy

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:90%
25 years ago.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Patricia Davis, British author.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.340 align:middle line:10%
Yes, and many others.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:10%
And bless their hearts,
they did what they knew.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But they had a certain
level of caution

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:90%
that they had to be cautionary.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And some of those very books
that are still on the shelves

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
all over the place, Barnes
and Noble's and whatnot,

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that they'll
have a whole list of essences

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that you dare not
ever supposed to use.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.002 align:middle line:10%
And you even signed agreements,
it used to be anyway.

00:19:36.002 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:10%
I haven't kept up with
it, so I don't know what

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:10%
the actual criteria right
now, or the law of the UK is.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
others that you can

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:10%
use, but with great caution.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:10%
The whole foundation of
that type of programming

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:10%
was based upon that the
allopathic philosophy

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:10%
and the powers that
be that propagated

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.580 align:middle line:10%
that programming
over just in the UK,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:10%
was that there were many that
didn't know the power already,

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:10%
it had been lost.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But there were
some "in the know"

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
that had done research that
were very "afraid" of what

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:84%
the original medicine of
the planet, if you will,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:90%
would do to their business.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical
industry, the allopathic.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:10%
If these people would
write and really

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:10%
talk about it in
an open, open way

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:10%
instead of all the cautionaries,
all the fears and this

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.810 align:middle line:10%
and that, what if, what if.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the total
lack of trust of Gaia,

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.514 align:middle line:84%
which I've already
talked in my back story.

00:20:39.514 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: And so that
being the case,

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:84%
the aromatherapists in UK
were basically encouraged,

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
you let the medicine alone,
don't talk about the medicinal

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:58.099 align:middle line:84%
uses, but talk about the
good smells and the--

00:20:58.099 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How it can relax you.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: -emotional
relaxation it does.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
very simple stuff.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I met you, which
was probably 12 years ago now,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe right when
you came to Sedona,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:84%
that was a different world
of aromatherapy than anything

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I had been exposed to.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.137 align:middle line:84%
I mean quantitatively,
qualitatively, every which way.

00:21:17.137 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Right.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, this
allows us the platform

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:90%
to go into the plant world.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And their relationship
with us, how you see them.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Because this is as vital
and alive as anything

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
that the human family
has with each other.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
What these plants have in
their own contracts and such.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I would like for you to
explain who they are,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and how they interface
with us and their mission.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: OK.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I love this part.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't very often
get into it this way.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:84%
But when I used to
teach level one-- now

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
we have contracted teachers--
I used to always take time

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:84%
because there were
the questions of OK,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
so, give me the back story of
the plant and tree kingdom.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I do believe they would say
now that they are conscious,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
just like we believe that
dolphins are conscious.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
The plant and tree
kingdom, there's

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
the whole study that's been
done at Damanhur out of Italy,

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:84%
where they've actually
connected electrodes

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to the root of an
avocado plant--

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:84%
it takes a couple weeks
to get it conditioned--

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and another two on a
leaf and they give it

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
a spectrum of tones
and a synthesizer.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And they have proven what
Max Planck said years ago

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:90%
that they make their own music.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable music.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are whole
teams of sisters

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that will go into the woods
and put the electrodes,

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and call people together in
Italy and Germany and France,

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and they will dance to the music
that the trees have produced

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:90%
and are live producing it.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: So it's like,
when I saw that on YouTube

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
here a couple years
ago, I said, oh, my God.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.947 align:middle line:90%
My work is done.

00:23:08.947 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not quite.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: It's complete.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Not quite.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, getting
back to this.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
The trees and plants told
me years ago after my mother

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:84%
taught me how to
speak and listen

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:90%
that they are on many planets.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
The planets in the galaxy,
in our solar system,

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and beyond, its
teeming with life.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Creator has-- it's just
teaming with life, folks.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And so the plants and trees
on different dimensions

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:90%
are everywhere.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.430 align:middle line:10%
And one of their most
exciting purposes

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:10%
and contracts and
missions-- whether it's

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:10%
here in third
dimensional the planet

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:10%
Earth right now, or on Venus,
on the sixth, seventh, or eighth

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:10%
dimension-- is they desire
to be the medicine for all

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:10%
their living species,
including themselves.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:10%
That is one of their
greatest joys and gifts.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:10%
So many places in our universe
and in the omniverse, what

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:10%
we know as trees and plants,
we see them as they are,

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:10%
but they're much,
much more than that.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Just like we are
much, much more.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
multi-dimensional

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.232 align:middle line:90%
and so are they.

00:24:19.232 --> 00:24:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: And we're all
magnificent beings.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.523 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:21.523 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: Whether we're in an iron
lung, or whether or not we're

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:84%
the best champion of the
pole vault in the world,

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:90%
in the Olympics.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So that being said, this
is what they love to do.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's the only
thing or it's always that way,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:84%
but they told me years ago
that they were called here

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
before humanity was ever placed,
ever seeded on this planet,

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:90%
to be the medicine,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
but one more thing that a lot
of us forget all the time.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:90%
They are our oxygen.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, the five
basic elements,

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
if I can remember them right
quick for this interview,

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:84%
is there's hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon,

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:90%
and one other.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:13.956 align:middle line:90%
There's five of them.

00:25:13.956 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
should know, too.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm blanking too.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm in your story.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: OK.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I used to have it.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.639 align:middle line:90%
It's carbon, hydrogen--

00:25:21.639 --> 00:25:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Nitrogen and oxygen.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.800 align:middle line:90%
There's four, not five.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:90%
There's four.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So the plants are
breathing in the nitrogen,

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
but they don't use
the oxygen, they

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
slough that off
all over our planet

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:90%
so that you and I can live.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is so profound for a
lot of people, when they first

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
begin to remember-- whether it's
a natural science class when

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
they were in high
school or middle school,

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%
or just because they're
interested in how life works.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, the plants and
trees give us the oxygen.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:90%
So that's another huge part.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Without oxygen, we would
not be in this interview.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So all of you that are
listening right now,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
you should really
be thanking them.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You should take at
least a minute every day

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.000 align:middle line:84%
in your meditation, or even
if you're not meditating,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.450 align:middle line:84%
or if you're praying, and thank
Gaia via the plant and tree

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.300 align:middle line:84%
kingdom for the very
breath that we breathe.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note, this
is a little bit of a downer,

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.865 align:middle line:84%
but because of the just
ravaging of the forests

00:26:27.865 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and clear-cutting of
the Amazon and so many

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
regions of the world, we are
going into now a reduced oxygen

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.237 align:middle line:84%
capacity, which is essential
for our immune system.

00:26:39.237 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: And this is one
of the reasons why there's

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.346 align:middle line:84%
an increase in
respiratory problems.

00:26:43.346 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: All over the planet.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:84%
The chemtrails is
another gigantic issue;

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
however, on the love
choosing the glass half full,

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
the plants and trees are
ascending and changing just

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.847 align:middle line:90%
like every other species.

00:27:01.847 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's so
wonderful to hear.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: And so, humans,
the powers that be that

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:11.200 align:middle line:84%
still have decided that they
will not relinquish their hold

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
on enslavement of one
another and their greed,

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're very fearful
because their oxygen is fear.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: Wisdom of
the Earth and what

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.090 align:middle line:84%
we teach, and what the
plants and trees teach,

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.490 align:middle line:90%
our oxygen is divine love.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:90%
That simple.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:10%
And so therefore, the trees and
plants under their contract,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:10%
they don't live with
a contract of fear.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:10%
It's all unconditional love.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:10%
So when you think of chemtrails
and the ravaging of the forests

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:10%
and the pollution from the
high-tech so-called betterment

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:10%
new inventions, instead
of being in harmony,

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:10%
it's going into the
lakes, into the streams,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:10%
into the rivers, the BP spill.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Now the Exxon spill that
just is happening right now

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
in Mayflower, a little borough
north of Little Rock, Arkansas,

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle line:84%
where these subdivisions
of very wonderful homes,

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:84%
the putrid pure leak
out of Exxon pipeline

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is running down the
streets of people

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and they can't even live there.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.835 align:middle line:90%
And it's a media blackout.

00:28:21.835 --> 00:28:24.210 align:middle line:84%
The only way you could find
about it is going on YouTube.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84%
All of these kinds of
things, the trees and plants

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:32.840 align:middle line:84%
are stepping up to the occasion
and saying we are here to help.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:90%
We are going to change.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:10%
And that is why they become
great allies for the human

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:43.560 align:middle line:10%
species, because they know how
to do things that we don't.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:10%
And also they don't
have to deal-- yes, they

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:10%
have to deal with humans
that are cutting them down,

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:10%
but there's still way
more plants and trees,

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.860 align:middle line:10%
way more than 7.12
billion of humans.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: And so that's a
positive, positive note.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just to finish
up that little dark part

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
of this conversation, how are
they handling the chemtrails?

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: OK.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.265 align:middle line:84%
So what is happening--
this can be a downer.

00:29:13.265 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed-- and we
deal with it all the time.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest respiratory
issues on the planet

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
worldwide is
allergies and asthma.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:84%
My wife, brought up in Queens,
has been dealing with it

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:90%
and has come such a long ways.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But you remember
10, 20 years ago

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.390 align:middle line:84%
when people would move from
the east coast, where there

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:84%
was so much of the pollution,
so we're going to Arizona back

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.990 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.170 align:middle line:90%
We can breathe better.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It was known for that.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: Well, do you know that
that's all a thing of the past.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was a sister that
called me from New Jersey just

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:03.072 align:middle line:84%
this past week and I said,
"You can barely talk.

00:30:03.072 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you have allergies?"

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.609 align:middle line:84%
"Oh," she says,
"it's so horrible."

00:30:05.609 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:10%
She says, "I've been
thinking about selling

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.132 align:middle line:10%
my place literally and
moving to Arizona."

00:30:10.132 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have the
heart to tell her.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.127 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't.

00:30:13.127 --> 00:30:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: You may for
just a little bit,

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's
different allergies.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But the allergies are
running rampant here

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.430 align:middle line:90%
in Arizona, Sedona, the juniper.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.660 align:middle line:84%
How are they working
here, that's my point.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting to the point.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:84%
The down part of it is
that the trees and plants,

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:38.120 align:middle line:84%
like the junipers out here,
they are adapting and putting up

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:84%
more guards to the
human pollution, which

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:84%
is exuding even stronger
when they pollinate,

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:90%
stronger essences.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And those people who are
taking pharmaceutical drugs,

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.140 align:middle line:84%
are eating processed foods,
not eating right, not

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:84%
drinking water are
very emotionally toxic

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:84%
because of perhaps bad
relationships on maybe

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:84%
just with themselves,
not loving themselves.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.090 align:middle line:10%
They are being affected even
more because the trees are

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:10%
putting up the guard so
that they can survive

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.240 align:middle line:10%
and they can at least stay
the amount of pollution,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:10%
like in the chemtrails, long
enough to where they can take

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.100 align:middle line:10%
in the changes that Mother
Earth is experiencing;

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:10%
the new energies that are coming
in from the galactic center,

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:10%
from the solar flares, the
CMEs, the filament, all

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:10%
of these kinds of things.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of the downside.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be an
upside in encouraging

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:90%
us to take a new look.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.180 align:middle line:84%
If we truly choose,
no matter what

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:84%
level we are, to come back
into harmony with Mother,

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that will mean that we will
be able to be more in balance

00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:84%
with the plants and trees
because they're not leaving.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.790 align:middle line:90%
They're not leaving.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And what humans don't
understand is, once again,

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the back story-- they
were here before we were,

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and they know exactly how to
deal with any species that

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is trying to destroy not
only them, consciously

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.795 align:middle line:84%
or unconsciously,
because of greed, because

00:32:20.795 --> 00:32:23.600 align:middle line:84%
of I'm more powerful
than you, or just

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.830 align:middle line:84%
simply because we've been so
programmed that we're sleep.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:34.550 align:middle line:84%
That they are working together
with all the other species,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:40.240 align:middle line:84%
whether they be insects, whether
they be the rodent family,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.310 align:middle line:84%
whether they be the reptile
family-- the snakes and so

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:84%
forth-- or whether they
be with the other mammals.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Talk about-- trees and
plants aren't the others--

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
just the amount
of drugs that are

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:56.940 align:middle line:84%
put in the beef industry, the
milk industry from the bovine.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a retired dairy farmer
so that's very close to me,

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and a cash crop
farmer before I ever

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:07.650 align:middle line:84%
got into medicinal
aromatherapy full time.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:13.110 align:middle line:84%
That they are reeling
with the cruelty,

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:84%
the growth hormones, and their
bodies are having to adjust.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:90%
And they will.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, of course,
there will be no meat eaters--

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.697 align:middle line:90%
sorry-- on this planet because--

00:33:26.697 --> 00:33:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It won't be necessary.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.549 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: It won't be necessary.

00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that's the thing.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about-- everyone
talks about the word ascension.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our lovely
viewers watching this right

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:41.570 align:middle line:84%
now have been interfacing
with not the word and just

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:84%
the concept, but actually
actively participating

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.540 align:middle line:84%
in various things that will help
in their own ascension process.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But this very thing is happening
with the whole plant kingdom

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.820 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about stepping
up from a dimensional field

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:84%
into a higher or
elevated or finer,

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:84%
less dense dimensional
field, the plants

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:84%
are having to do
this, and the trees,

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and the animals
right alongside us.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be-- are they
doing it more efficiently,

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:84%
or are some of
them saying look, I

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:84%
belonged to-- I know
this is esoteric--

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
but I belonged to the
third dimensional density

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.525 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just-- what
I'm referring to here is

00:34:19.525 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
the die off of so many
species, of plants and critters

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:84%
and bugs, are some simply
saying, I was of that frequency

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing my
job at that frequency.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And are others
now coming in that

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:84%
are helping at this
particular frequency,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.010 align:middle line:84%
bridging us over into
the finer fields?

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Exactly.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't say it
any better there.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:84%
The actual happenings
and channelings,

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and even-- not for me,
but others like Telos,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and Adama, and Mount
Shasta and the city

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.429 align:middle line:84%
in Mount Shasta from the
Lemurian civilization,

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.010 align:middle line:84%
there's whole write
ups about the Sequoia

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and the great Redwoods
that have passed over.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But they're in the fifth
dimension waiting for Gaia--

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so
glad to hear that.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.430 align:middle line:90%
I so hate that.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: And they're
going to be back.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not going anywhere.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But that's what's happening
with our dolphin families

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and our manatees that are
right now, and the sting rays,

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.860 align:middle line:84%
they were lined for one
to three miles, nothing

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:84%
but hundreds and hundreds
of sting rays off

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Tel Aviv coast in Israel.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know, anybody can go
and find all of this information

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:90%
if you're interested.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Not to be looking at
the glass half empty,

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.940 align:middle line:84%
but to understand that there's
a much greater picture.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
That Mother Earth is
not going anywhere.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:47.610 align:middle line:84%
2012 was such a conglomeration
of confusion and fear based.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It was only the beginning
of something new

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and the end of something
that could no longer function

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.280 align:middle line:90%
properly in harmony.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So medicinal aromatherapy,
the plants and trees.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And that includes--
you know essences

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:08.930 align:middle line:84%
come from the blossoms, the
buds, the rhizomes, the roots,

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:84%
the bark, the heartwood,
the roots, the leaves,

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:18.270 align:middle line:84%
the branches, the needles,
it comes from every part.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And we should be so
thankful that they willingly

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.460 align:middle line:84%
give themselves for us, but
that is part of their contract.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:10%
To work with the animal kingdom.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:10%
So now first of all, I want
to get into some specifics

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:38.169 align:middle line:10%
because we could chat
esoterically all day long,

00:36:38.169 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:10%
you and I both know that.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But I want to get into some
practical grounded stuff,

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.050 align:middle line:84%
because people are going to
say, OK, this is great, now

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:90%
what can I do.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
allergies, for example.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Are there complimentary
aromas then,

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.970 align:middle line:84%
or essences there
that can essentially

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.925 align:middle line:84%
reverse the effects of
a lot of the allergies

00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing?

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.960 align:middle line:10%
And let me just start
into this little section

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:10%
saying that it's my
knowing through the years

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.930 align:middle line:10%
and my own experience, and
also Wisdom of the Earth

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:19.240 align:middle line:10%
is a result really of the
experiences of thousands

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.510 align:middle line:10%
of people emailing us
in tears and so forth,

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:10%
or calling us and saying
that it's working for them.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:10%
That's the point.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.270 align:middle line:10%
That's the point.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.015 align:middle line:10%
And so--

00:37:30.015 --> 00:37:32.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So you're getting
collective wisdom here.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:32.760 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.620 align:middle line:10%
So let's say there are
whole families that

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:10%
are for respiratory
ailments, from the lower

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:10%
respiratory to the upper
respiratory, to wet asthma

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.297 align:middle line:10%
to dry asthma, to--

00:37:44.297 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Sinus passage as well.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: -allergies.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:10%
And one of the greatest families
is the Myrtaceae family.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:56.930 align:middle line:10%
The Myrtaceae family includes
all the eucalyptuses that are

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.860 align:middle line:10%
distilled, there's
many that aren't.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:10%
Maybe at best there's
maybe been 16,

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.580 align:middle line:10%
20 that have ever
been distilled.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.640 align:middle line:10%
There's got to be 60 to 90
different species of eucalyptus

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.030 align:middle line:10%
on Mother Earth.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.810 align:middle line:10%
We have nine of them
that we work with.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:19.150 align:middle line:10%
The Myrtaceae family
includes all the myrtles.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.692 align:middle line:10%
You were attracted
to a myrtle today.

00:38:20.692 --> 00:38:21.275 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:21.275 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:10%
A beautiful lemon myrtle.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:22.840 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:10%
And also it includes in the
world of medicinal aromatherapy

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:34.204 align:middle line:10%
all of the Tea Tree people.

00:38:34.204 --> 00:38:36.370 align:middle line:10%
Which a lot of people think
of tea tree as Tea Tree,

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.730 align:middle line:10%
but that's part of
the Melaleuca family.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.670 align:middle line:10%
And the Melaleuca family, we
have about five or six of them.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:10%
That can be cajuput.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.520 align:middle line:10%
That can be niaouli.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.900 align:middle line:10%
That can be tea tree,
the famous tea tree.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.930 align:middle line:10%
It can be nerolina.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.160 align:middle line:10%
And it can be rosalina.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:10%
There's five of the
Melaleuca's right there

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.490 align:middle line:10%
that are used
extensively for, not only

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:10%
antibacterial, antimicrobial;
but in this particular topic

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:10%
right now, allergies,
it is huge.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.760 align:middle line:10%
It is huge.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And people
are getting relief.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.140 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: Getting relief
through topical application,

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:10%
making teas.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:10%
And you can sweeten it
with something natural,

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.397 align:middle line:10%
like agave, Stevia, honey.

00:39:23.397 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And I would think,
because then, you're also--

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.360 align:middle line:10%
you have the olfactory portion
and your [DEEP INHALATION]

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.280 align:middle line:84%
breathing in the vapors
at the same time--

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Inhalation.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -so it has to
be helping your sinuses.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.680 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: The old
French approach that's

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:10%
very famous in
especially Provence,

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:42.930 align:middle line:10%
is that you take a large
bath towel and you heat it up

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:48.160 align:middle line:10%
and you have the steam coming
up from your coffee or tea mug.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.830 align:middle line:10%
But in this case,
what you're doing is

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:10%
you're putting just
a few drops of one

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.770 align:middle line:10%
of the eucalyptuses
or something else.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:58.200 align:middle line:10%
And you are inhaling
that for your allergy,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.990 align:middle line:10%
for your respiratory problem.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:05.280 align:middle line:10%
And they are considered, even
scientifically, mucolytic.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.700 align:middle line:10%
And in doing that,
you're going to cough,

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.770 align:middle line:10%
but it's going to
loosen the phlegm

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.730 align:middle line:10%
and you're going to be
able to cough it up.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:18.630 align:middle line:10%
So the results of allergies,
respiratory, asthma

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:22.210 align:middle line:10%
are very, very
profound and in lieu

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.920 align:middle line:10%
of Sudafed and many,
many other things

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.327 align:middle line:10%
without the side effects.

00:40:26.327 --> 00:40:26.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And they smell delightful as
well, your whole environment.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
another area that

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.210 align:middle line:84%
seems to be chronic in modern
society, in the Western world,

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and that is a general
breakdown in the whole process

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.940 align:middle line:90%
of digestion and elimination.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:47.120 align:middle line:90%


00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: It's just
so huge, again.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.740 align:middle line:10%
When it comes to the
respiratory breathing,

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.110 align:middle line:10%
taking into food
the colon, colonics,

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:02.650 align:middle line:10%
the digestion of
food, it's huge.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.370 align:middle line:10%
And yes, again, the
plant and tree kingdom

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:10%
for eons and in oral tradition
and written tradition--

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:19.350 align:middle line:10%
even people like Hippocrates,
Paracelsus, Ptolemy,

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:10%
if I'm pronouncing
that right and many,

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.080 align:middle line:10%
many others talked
about such essences

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:32.120 align:middle line:10%
as tarragon, like the famous
French tarragon, the dill seed,

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.580 align:middle line:10%
the celery seed, the fennel.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:10%
Now interestingly enough,
even before the ones

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.930 align:middle line:10%
that I just mentioned
who are famous,

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:48.690 align:middle line:10%
Paracelsus or like Hippocrates,
that's where the Hippocrates

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:53.800 align:middle line:10%
Oath comes before any allopathic
doctor can be licensed.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.530 align:middle line:10%
But they-- probably
most of them, I've

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:10%
talked to different
ones and friends

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.070 align:middle line:10%
that I've known and
know, they don't

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.550 align:middle line:10%
read what Hippocrates
really said.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:10%
But that's OK, that's OK.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:10.590 align:middle line:10%
But even before that, when King
Tut's tomb was unearthed back

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:15.200 align:middle line:10%
in the '40s or '30s
by some very renowned

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:21.000 align:middle line:10%
British archaeologists, they
found a scroll with over-- I

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.460 align:middle line:10%
think it was over
700 feet long, and it

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:31.430 align:middle line:10%
had over 300 different protocols
for such things as digestion.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:36.430 align:middle line:10%
And they were big sugar lovers
3,500 or 3,700 years ago,

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:middle line:10%
and they had huge
bouts with diabetes.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.230 align:middle line:10%
And these very
essences that I just

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:47.920 align:middle line:10%
mentioned to you, for not only
digestion but for diabetes,

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.650 align:middle line:10%
are mentioned.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:55.520 align:middle line:10%
One particular species of
eucalyptus, tarragon, dill,

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.390 align:middle line:10%
celery and fennel, just those
five alone for digestion,

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:10%
for Crohn's disease,
for irritable bowel,

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:12.240 align:middle line:10%
colitis, diverticulitis, all
of those types of things.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:19.450 align:middle line:10%
The essences, if the human
that is asking advice from us,

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:22.970 align:middle line:10%
here at Wisdom of the Earth,
let's say specifically me,

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:26.400 align:middle line:10%
if they are willing
to take a renewed

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.160 align:middle line:10%
look at their diet, of
their emotional life--

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.930 align:middle line:10%
because remember,
remember, the essences

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.210 align:middle line:10%
are not the pink
or the blue pill.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.920 align:middle line:10%
They are facilitators.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:43.660 align:middle line:10%
But the body because of the DNA
makeup of the plant and tree

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.390 align:middle line:10%
kingdom, it's the same
as our physical body.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.210 align:middle line:10%
Because when we came
here as spiritual beings,

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:10%
we were actually-- what
the indigenous people say,

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.550 align:middle line:10%
they say two things.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:58.260 align:middle line:10%
We were loaned a physical
body for the duration

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.050 align:middle line:10%
of our contract
and mission here.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.830 align:middle line:10%
And we were also gifted.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:10%
Loaning and gifting
are two special things

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.010 align:middle line:10%
that the indigenous people
taught in their history

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:10%
about how that we
should respect.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.550 align:middle line:10%
And my father taught me
that was part of this,

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:10%
that he taught me about
wisdom and knowledge

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.100 align:middle line:10%
and intellectualism.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:18.810 align:middle line:10%
You can-

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We've been gifted
these beautiful plants

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:10%
and healing agents
all around us.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Animals know-- they
know intuitively

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.420 align:middle line:90%
what to do with them.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to get
the cures pretty quickly.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.710 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: People often tell
me when they first come,

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.340 align:middle line:10%
they'll have their favorite
domesticated cat or cats, dog

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.600 align:middle line:10%
or dogs, and they
will say, you know,

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.690 align:middle line:10%
I always wondered how they
knew when we let them outside

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:42.900 align:middle line:10%
and I could tell they
kind of had a tummy ache,

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:10%
they would go up to
the grass or they

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:49.520 align:middle line:10%
would go to the sand or the
dirt and start chewing on it.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.312 align:middle line:10%
That's because no matter
how domesticated they get,

00:44:52.312 --> 00:44:55.106 align:middle line:10%
they still have an affinity
towards the plant and tree

00:44:55.106 --> 00:44:55.799 align:middle line:10%
kingdom.

00:44:55.799 --> 00:44:56.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.120 align:middle line:10%
So we've talked about
allergies, we've

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.460 align:middle line:10%
talked about the
digestive system,

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.210 align:middle line:10%
let's talk a little
bit about emotions.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:08.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are suffering
from huge levels of anxiety.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Time is going so
quickly now, just

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:13.530 align:middle line:90%
feeling pressure from all sides.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:16.200 align:middle line:90%
So anxiety and depression.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.720 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the essences that

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.290 align:middle line:84%
are famous for their
profound work there?

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: When it comes
to depression and fear

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.780 align:middle line:84%
via the neurotransmitters
and the neuroreceptors,

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and there's a great book
by Candace Pert called

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.990 align:middle line:90%
"Molecules of Emotion."

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
She is the first female that
came out of the closet, years

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and years with the National
Institute of Health.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:49.560 align:middle line:84%
She actually discovered the
endorphins and enkephalins,

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.480 align:middle line:84%
but because of the
male dominance,

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.410 align:middle line:84%
she was put in the background,
into the place that she

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:59.920 align:middle line:84%
was one of the famous
women today who came out

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.510 align:middle line:84%
of the closet and said I
can't take this anymore.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that discovered this
and I'm going to write a book.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Now she's been--

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is she still alive?

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:10.995 align:middle line:90%
I know she's--

00:46:10.995 --> 00:46:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: I don't know.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -quite elderly.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: I met her personally.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.029 align:middle line:90%
I think she is.

00:46:14.029 --> 00:46:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: But they granted her a
lot of kudos and some of them

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.530 align:middle line:90%
have apologized.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:23.394 align:middle line:84%
I know she told me
they have apologized.

00:46:23.394 --> 00:46:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But this is just what
we've been dealing with.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:25.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:30.190 align:middle line:10%
So what I'm saying, emotions.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the most amazing
essences and one

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:84%
of the most sought after and
one of the most sold essences

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:44.610 align:middle line:84%
in our portfolio of over 200 and
some essences, is laurel leaf.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Laurel leaf is one
of the most famous.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:50.230 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the queens
of the lymphatic system.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But its history dates
back both documentation

00:46:54.110 --> 00:47:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and orally, the most recent
is the huge Roman Empire.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.340 align:middle line:84%
The Caesars were always
crowned and inaugurated

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.340 align:middle line:90%
with laurel leaves around.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you look into the legions
of the military excursions

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:16.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Roman Empire, you will
find at many different places

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.800 align:middle line:84%
where they used-- the soldiers
before they would go out

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.680 align:middle line:84%
knowing that they would
not come back, for courage,

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.700 align:middle line:84%
for being courageous,
heroism, they

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.400 align:middle line:84%
would douse themselves
with laurel leaf.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And they knew about
the essential essence

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:33.760 align:middle line:90%
of laurel leaf.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's much, much
older than the Roman Empire.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And they would make
teas out of it.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:44.410 align:middle line:10%
So that would be for the
emotional anxiety and fear that

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:47.010 align:middle line:10%
is running rampant in the world.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:48.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's not the only one.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.390 align:middle line:10%
There's others like your
Petitgrain family, which

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:59.080 align:middle line:10%
comes from the leaves and the
outer branches of citrus trees,

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.090 align:middle line:10%
like lime Petitgrain, mandarin
Petitgrain, orange Petitgrain--

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I love all of those.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: -and lemon Petitgrain.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just love them.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Can't get enough.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Yeah.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Very medicinal pungent smelling.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.784 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
rose or carnation.

00:48:10.784 --> 00:48:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: But it has this
very [WHOOSHING SOUND].

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It affects the central
nervous system.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it calms the
central nervous system

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.744 align:middle line:90%
so this helps relinquish fear.

00:48:22.744 --> 00:48:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Exactly.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:23.951 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And anxiety from that pressure.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Now what about depression,
which is more subtle and varied

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.931 align:middle line:84%
in nature, which is
beyond overwhelmed.

00:48:32.931 --> 00:48:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.930 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:36.165 align:middle line:84%
The citrus family,
again, is huge.

00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:40.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge gift
to the human being.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:46.410 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to just the citrus
family as we usually know it,

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:47.670 align:middle line:90%
it's not the Petitgrain.

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:50.505 align:middle line:90%
We know it from the fruit.

00:48:50.505 --> 00:48:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The orange, the tangerine,
the grapefruit, the lemon,

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.920 align:middle line:90%
the lime, the Mandarin.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.440 align:middle line:90%
The bergamot.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.330 align:middle line:90%


00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:03.170 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that
it's not the pulp,

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:07.410 align:middle line:10%
but it's the cold or warm
pressing into an essential

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:10.970 align:middle line:10%
essence-- or an essential aura,
we call it essential essence--

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:16.740 align:middle line:10%
of the rind of those fruits from
those citrus trees that give

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.440 align:middle line:10%
us--

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.550 align:middle line:10%
Now strangely enough,
my father, growing up,

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:24.890 align:middle line:10%
taught me that when
you go to a restaurant,

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.330 align:middle line:10%
when they give you the
little garnish of the lime

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.120 align:middle line:10%
or the lemon, you
eat the whole thing.

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.670 align:middle line:84%
He never told me when
I was that young,

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:84%
he didn't choose to tell
me that the essential oil

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.600 align:middle line:84%
or essential essence
is in the rind.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So every time you eat that,
it has a very uplifting.

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:46.880 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely an
anti-depressant.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anybody that has
had the experience of being

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:51.140 align:middle line:84%
around someone
sitting nearby who's

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.560 align:middle line:84%
just begun breaking into
the peel of an orange

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and those essential oils
are spraying all around,

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.710 align:middle line:84%
it's just immediately
[DEEP INHALATION]

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:01.780 align:middle line:84%
a breath of fresh
air, of where is that.

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.804 align:middle line:90%
I want one.

00:50:02.804 --> 00:50:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Exactly.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We know
this intuitively.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:07.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we talked also
about the whole notion

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:15.280 align:middle line:84%
of our ascension and moving
from this one, a denser,

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.890 align:middle line:84%
physical reality into a lighter
physical reality, which also

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:21.670 align:middle line:84%
has the same emotional
components attached to it;

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:24.790 align:middle line:84%
going into a lighter, less
greedy, less selfish way

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.550 align:middle line:90%
of being on the planet.

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:29.810 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
sublime essential oils that

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.980 align:middle line:84%
help bridge us on a
consciousness level

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.897 align:middle line:90%
up into these finer fields?

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:34.396 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: OK.

00:50:34.396 --> 00:50:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.944 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say--
again, I'm trying

00:50:40.944 --> 00:50:43.360 align:middle line:84%
to keep it simple because I
know there's people listening.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:46.690 align:middle line:84%
You could lecture for days
just on that one subject.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:51.320 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPP: So there is
a particular part

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:58.280 align:middle line:10%
of many species of plants and
trees that activate the heart.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.400 align:middle line:10%
We call them heart and
ascension essences.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:07.200 align:middle line:10%
And let me just define, as I'm
sure many of the interviews

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.320 align:middle line:10%
that you've had, to what we
do when we teach our students.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.640 align:middle line:10%
For us, ascension is--
the two simplest things

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.730 align:middle line:10%
is enlightenment.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:20.320 align:middle line:10%
Going out of duality where
there's fear and love,

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:23.030 align:middle line:10%
to a higher level where
there's going to be only

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.390 align:middle line:10%
love, and fear will
be nonexistent.

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:27.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's one part of ascension.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.830 align:middle line:84%
The other part of ascension
is God finding God,

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:33.160 align:middle line:84%
because we are all
magnificent beings.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.410 align:middle line:90%
We're gods.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:37.190 align:middle line:10%
We're not Creator,
Source, but we are gods.

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:45.730 align:middle line:10%
And so based upon that
premise, the blossom essences

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:51.590 align:middle line:10%
are a huge part of the
portfolio for ascension,

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:55.020 align:middle line:10%
in using them and
getting into our hearts.

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:59.030 align:middle line:10%
Such essences as
Ylang Ylang blossom.

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:00.440 align:middle line:10%
That is like a long string.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.930 align:middle line:10%
Looks like yellow, like-- and
some of those trees grow 120,

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:06.950 align:middle line:10%
some of those
grandmothers are huge.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And they look like bananas,
the blossom, kind of like long.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the famous rose.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.500 align:middle line:90%
The rose petals only.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
pure rose essence.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Not to stem, not
the flowering tops.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Now lavender is another one.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But the lavender is
not only the blossom,

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.650 align:middle line:84%
it's the flowering tops
of the lavender plant.

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:31.980 align:middle line:84%
We have jasmine,
just the blossoms.

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:36.040 align:middle line:10%
Both the famous
holy Sambac jasmine,

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.000 align:middle line:10%
which is the more
feminine aspect

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.640 align:middle line:10%
energetically of the
jasmine family essence.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
Egyptian jasmine,

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.030 align:middle line:84%
which is more of the
masculine energy,

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:50.310 align:middle line:90%
more pungent, but still jasmine.

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:52.790 align:middle line:90%
We have coffee flower.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:55.720 align:middle line:90%
We have ambrette seed.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.686 align:middle line:90%
We have osmanthus flowers.

00:52:57.686 --> 00:52:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about lotus?

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Where does lotus come in?

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Lotus is huge.

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Lotus and lily.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:08.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a great-- the
lily is a lotus, too.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But in the lily,
that whole family,

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:18.560 align:middle line:84%
you have the lily pads and then
the lotus flower or the lily

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.080 align:middle line:84%
flower, because there's lots of
different jargon about it, that

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.510 align:middle line:90%
grows right up off the lily pad.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:25.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:26.860 align:middle line:84%
That's the lily
flower, but that's

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.940 align:middle line:90%
part of the lotus family.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:33.660 align:middle line:90%
The Nelumbo nucifera family.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But then you have the famous
Egyptian, the blue lotus,

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.800 align:middle line:84%
the white lotus,
the pink, that's

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.300 align:middle line:84%
the lotus, the Nelumbo,
that the stem grows right up

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.710 align:middle line:84%
out of the muck right
out of the mother.

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
this gorgeous blossom

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that opens up and, like the blue
lotus on our reference guide

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.910 align:middle line:84%
book, you'll see,
like, it's almost

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:58.180 align:middle line:90%
self-lighting the center of it.

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a pungent
but sublime scent.

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can almost feel it
bridging you to another place.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Yes.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:14.940 align:middle line:84%
The lotus is so esoteric,
so rare, extremely valuable

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:21.990 align:middle line:84%
money-wise, and so few farmers
in India or in different parts

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:24.460 align:middle line:84%
of Asia are choosing--
Bali-- to do it

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:26.950 align:middle line:90%
at this time with the demand.

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we had lotus blue
like for seven years.

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of Egypt?

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: It was out of India.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:33.947 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of India.

00:54:33.947 --> 00:54:34.447 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:34.447 --> 00:54:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: A farmer.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:39.227 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the secret is
handed down for generations.

00:54:39.227 --> 00:54:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: A lot of these-- I mean
the nutmeg and the black pepper

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that we get, we get it
from farmers in India that

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:50.760 align:middle line:84%
are 800 and 900 years within
their family doing this.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.440 align:middle line:84%
This is not just some
willy-nilly thing that you go

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.550 align:middle line:90%
and, oh, I would like to.

00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thought, I can't
wait for more and more people

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:03.730 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
to indigenously

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:07.930 align:middle line:84%
distill in harmony
with Mother Earth,

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:11.400 align:middle line:84%
not in greed or anything,
but to do it rightfully.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But the lotus blue
we no longer have.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But now we've had to go
over into the white lotus.

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:22.030 align:middle line:10%
And the secret is always
those farmers understanding

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:28.300 align:middle line:10%
when they distill that they can
capture in their distillation

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:33.830 align:middle line:10%
as much of the fragrance of the
flower, more so than the stem.

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.850 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the farmers,
bless their hearts,

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:39.330 align:middle line:10%
it's still wonderful, it's
still basically the same price,

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.560 align:middle line:10%
but because I've
been in this so long,

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:47.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm smelling the stem on more of
an even basis than the flower.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always looking
for that flower

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:56.090 align:middle line:84%
because emotionally there is
volumes and volumes and volumes

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and volumes and volumes of
history in the Sanskrit,

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.890 align:middle line:84%
in the Vedic, in
the Asian history,

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:07.540 align:middle line:84%
in the Chinese history, in the
Japanese history, the Hindu,

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:13.190 align:middle line:84%
the Buddhist, the Zoroaster,
the Shinto of these secrets

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and blessings
medicinally, emotionally,

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:21.102 align:middle line:84%
and spiritually as an ascension
tool for the lotus family.

00:56:21.102 --> 00:56:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
thank you for that.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I know it's very-- I still
have a few drops left in a jar.

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so pricey
if you can ever find it.

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It was the blue lotus, as a
matter of fact, from back then.

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.124 align:middle line:84%
And so I just wanted to get
a little flavor of that.

00:56:35.124 --> 00:56:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Now one other-- I'm going to
ask you about one other thing

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's universally,
or at least in the West,

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.209 align:middle line:90%
so comforting.

00:56:41.209 --> 00:56:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we only have
a couple minutes left

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to ask you
something on a larger scale.

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Vanilla.

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we just
soften and take a deep breath

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and want to sink into something
soft when we smell vanilla?

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: I think it's a
combination of nostalgia

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:05.200 align:middle line:84%
from even co-generational
DNA to the vanilla

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:09.447 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps we had in some
of our Spanish backgrounds.

00:57:09.447 --> 00:57:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: The Latin background.

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:17.040 align:middle line:84%
From all around
the Mediterranean.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.870 align:middle line:84%
From the romantic
language background.

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:25.720 align:middle line:84%
The vanilla is-- it
presents vanilla bean

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and it presents a fragrance
of comfort, of nurturing,

00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and that is absolutely-- vanilla
is one of those essences coming

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:43.500 align:middle line:84%
from the bean that is very
much for anti-depression.

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:47.572 align:middle line:84%
As a heart-- you know, helping
to get out of the head--

00:57:47.572 --> 00:57:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And into the heart.

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: -and into the heart.

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:57:51.045 --> 00:57:52.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.159 align:middle line:84%
So on that note, now
I want to ask you,

00:57:54.159 --> 00:57:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've
trained a lot of people.

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:58.630 align:middle line:84%
You now have an
M.D., who has chosen

00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to join the ranks of
people that are trained now

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:02.930 align:middle line:90%
to be using this.

00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And you were working with a
doctor named Dr. Sam Berne,

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and I remember reading something
in one of your newsletters

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.010 align:middle line:84%
about working with a
morphogenetic field

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:14.080 align:middle line:90%
with essences.

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.430 align:middle line:84%
We have just a couple
minutes left now.

00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain
what was done there,

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll have to say
goodbye until next time.

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPP: So if you go back into
a lot of the esoteric scientists

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:29.130 align:middle line:84%
like Max Planck and
others, they were always

00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:33.190 align:middle line:84%
pushing the envelope that
there was something more that

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:37.500 align:middle line:84%
caused the interaction
between animals and humans,

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.230 align:middle line:90%
between humans and humans.

00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:41.467 align:middle line:90%
Like feeling someone--

00:58:41.467 --> 00:58:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rupert
Sheldrake's work for anyone

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.787 align:middle line:84%
that wants to read
on this further.

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Another one.

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Another one.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And so to make
this really quick,

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.520 align:middle line:84%
there came a time when
even Tesla worked with it.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And there came a time when they
coined the word morphogenic,

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:01.305 align:middle line:84%
where the fields even
beyond the aura that

00:59:01.305 --> 00:59:03.250 align:middle line:90%
were all interconnecting.

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So the plants and trees, to
make it very condensed here,

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:10.270 align:middle line:84%
the plants and trees
create a morphogenic field

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:12.060 align:middle line:90%
just like we humans do.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And there is a place
like where Rumi

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.030 align:middle line:90%
says, meet me out in the field.

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:21.470 align:middle line:84%
There is a place where
we interface together.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And that place--
Dr. Sam Berne has

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.120 align:middle line:84%
done-- he's doing
a wonderful work.

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.060 align:middle line:84%
He's an optometrist MD,
he works with the eyes,

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and he's having amazing results
with children, adults with just

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.580 align:middle line:84%
eye problems and
working with essences

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and creating a more of a bonding
of the morphogenic field.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:48.440 align:middle line:84%
He also does dolphin swims
with the essences for the eyes

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and for going into
the pineal gland,

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:54.220 align:middle line:84%
into the spiritual,
back into the heart

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and all of this focusing
towards the ascension.

00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:59:59.410 --> 01:00:00.450 align:middle line:10%
OK, Barry.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:middle line:10%
On that note, I'm going
to have to say goodbye,

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.300 align:middle line:10%
but that sounds like that might
be another conversation down

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:05.800 align:middle line:10%
the road.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: I think so.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much for your time.

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:10.747 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPP: Thank you so much.

01:00:10.747 --> 01:00:12.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To learn more
about Wisdom of the Earth,

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.830 align:middle line:10%

to give you an introduction
to the world of aromatherapy.

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
