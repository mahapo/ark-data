>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of the
most misunderstood aspects

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:84%
of a healthy diet
is fats and oils.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
There's been so much
controversy over the subject

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that people throw up
their hands and look

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
for a bag of potato chips to
ease the pain of confusion.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, recent news is
that the government is finally

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:90%
acknowledging the problem.

>>They are the ingredients that
make cookies and cakes taste

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:90%
better and pie crust flakier.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But today, the Food
and Drug Administration

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:84%
says trans fats are no
longer recognized as safe

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and the FDA intends to ban them.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>With the FDA's
announcement about trans fat,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.670 align:middle line:84%
you probably wonder what
are trans fats doing

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:90%
in our food in the first place?

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:84%
It's all about taste,
texture, a longer shelf life.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:84%
They basically make processed
foods taste really good.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:90%
But there's a downside.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It raises bad cholesterol,
lowers the good kind,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and leads to 20,000
heart attacks

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.407 align:middle line:90%
and 7,000 deaths a year.

author of "Fats That Heal,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Fats That Kill", is here to
give us the ultimate overview

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:84%
of what kind of fats our brains
and bodies absolutely need

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and which ones will
create ill health.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Udo, welcome.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.605 align:middle line:90%
We go way back.

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:45.896 align:middle line:90%
>>UDO ERASMUS: Nice to be here.

00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've been on
programs over the last 15 years.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I did my show,
"Regina's Vegetarian

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Table" on PBS and
wrote those cookbooks,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
it was based solely
on your method

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.152 align:middle line:84%
of not destroying fats and
creating trans fats, which is--

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Right.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --another
half of the subject

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get into.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:84%
But this is huge, that report,
how do you eliminate trans fats

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
from what we know on
the shelves today?

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.085 align:middle line:84%
I mean the shelves
would be empty.

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Well, we've
already gone a ways

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
to get that done because
this has been going on.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But they were in
the food supply.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:90%
They were invented in 1911.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:90%
That's when they were patented.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And they never had to
be put on the labels.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't know that
they were even in there.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:84%
The only way you
could find out is

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
if you added all the other
fats together and then

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.565 align:middle line:84%
the total fat, subtracted
that from the total fats.

00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And what was left
over was the trans fats.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.722 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
have to be labeled.

00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
thing-- go ahead.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.679 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And then Harvard
School of Public Health,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Walter Willett and
his group, they

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:90%
did a bunch of experiments.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Put their neck on the
line, because this

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
was a big industry,
and publicized

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.819 align:middle line:90%
all the dangers they have.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:90%
There's more.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:90%
There's not just heart attacks.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But they interfere
with immune function.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
They interfere with
reproduction in animals.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
We haven't done human
studies on that.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And they are worse for diabetes.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
problems that they cause.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And so gradually
they're taking them out.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But now if you go on an
airplane and they give you

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.001 align:middle line:84%
those crackers and cookies,
they don't have to be labeled.

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.792 align:middle line:84%
So they're putting the
trans fats in there.

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:23.041 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wait.

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, now why did they
not have to be labeled?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Well, it's
because they're little

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:90%
and they hand them out to you.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Because they hand them out.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: That's
your snack, right?

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're talking
Nabisco and those companies.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Which I would think
that if they're

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.911 align:middle line:84%
having to remove the trans fats
from their main product line,

00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
why would they add them back
in for these little snack

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:90%
packs for example?

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.648 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Well,
because they still

00:03:42.648 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:90%
have machinery that makes them.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.541 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.297 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess that's
pretty simple.

00:03:46.297 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:90%
But if you look at--

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.682 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: The government didn't
say take the machinery down.

00:03:50.682 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if you
go to a supermarket

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the aisles
and aisles and aisles

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:84%
of processed foods, whether
it's a package Mac and Cheese,

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a cake mix,
pre-made cookies, breads,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, still at this
time most of those products

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.555 align:middle line:90%
have trans fats in them.

00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yup.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, many of them do.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Many of them do.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the ones that don't
will usually now post it

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.265 align:middle line:90%
on the label, no trans fats.

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you've gone
to that trouble--

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.431 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: But even that's not
true because you can have half

00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:24.459 align:middle line:84%
a percent of trans
fats in them or 0.49%--

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --and then you
round to the next whole number.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So you can have trans
fats in it and the label

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:90%
will say no trans fats.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's not totally
clean information either.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Because it's
labeling rules, right?

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
now-- remind me--

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go into
something in a little bit.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you a sign I saw
outside of Whole Foods.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But when does that
labeling law finally

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
take effect, where
everything must

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:90%
be labeled if it has trans fats?

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: I think it's
being done state by state.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So like 2016?

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: It's in the process.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's in
the process, OK.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've been fighting
with this for a long time,

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
just putting your work
out there and trying

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:90%
to tell the truth behind it.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And before we go
any further, I'd

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
like you to tell the tale of
what happened to you when you

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
were young and foolish, as a
gardener that wasn't wearing

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
shoes and stepping through
pesticides all day.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Just give us that
bit of story so we

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
can help the people
understand the organic nature

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:90%
of how you learned this.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Well, there's
nothing like a personal disaster

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.376 align:middle line:90%
to get your attention.

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%
I was spraying pesticides.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing it
very carelessly.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
I was very emotionally

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
upset because my
marriage had broken up

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.825 align:middle line:84%
and so I wanted
to kill something.

00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So I took a job as
a pesticide sprayer.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.814 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was this
at Butchart Gardens?

00:05:41.814 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: No, no, no.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.225 align:middle line:90%
I was doing it commercially--

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Commercially, OK.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --at different
places all around Vancouver,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:90%
in Canada.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And I was really careless.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And I would literally
walk barefoot

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:90%
through the lawns I had sprayed.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And people would say to
me, aren't you worried?

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, nah, I'm immune.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the skin
started peeling off

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:90%
the bottom of my feet.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, maybe
that's not a good idea.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:90%
So then I wore rubber boots.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:90%
But I was vain.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was a summer job
and I'm very fair skinned.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I always wanted to have a tan.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.465 align:middle line:84%
So I would do my spraying,
wearing a bathing suit

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:90%
and rubber boots.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had a tractor
with a big tank.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be spraying everywhere.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel the wind
drift the spray on my back.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And I just didn't care.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And the predictable
thing happened.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Three years later,
I got poisoned

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.015 align:middle line:90%
by the pesticides I sprayed.

00:06:34.015 --> 00:06:34.182 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:34.800 align:middle line:90%
You think.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So now the
doctor couldn't help me

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have anything for that.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
the day I realized,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
oh, my health is actually
my responsibility.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't care
about it, nobody does.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So I then started
reading because I

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:84%
have a really good background
in biological sciences,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:90%
biochemistry, genetics.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:90%
So I can read all that stuff.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
in the journals,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:84%
in the research journals, about
health and nutrition, disease

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and nutrition.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:90%
And why that?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if your body is made out
of food, water, and air, then

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:84%
probably the first place to look
when something isn't working

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
is that the quality of
the food, water, and air

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.287 align:middle line:84%
that you're making
the body out of.

00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Un-huh.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And then I got
stuck on fats because-- or oils

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:90%
particularly.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Because oils are our
most sensitive nutrients,

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
they should be treated
with the most care.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:84%
They are actually treated
with the least care.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
When industry makes oils,
they squeeze the oil out

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
or they dissolve it
out with a solvent,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:90%
whichever way they do it.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they treat the oil
with Drano, sodium hydroxide;

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
phosphoric acid, which
is window washing acid.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Then they bleach the oil.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:90%
That makes it rancid.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Now, it smells bad.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And to clean up the
rancidity, they heat the oil

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
to frying temperature,
sometimes as high as 425 degrees

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Fahrenheit.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
This is like the high end
of frying temperature.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.916 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, as
a summary, that oil

00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:84%
has been treated with Drano,
window washing acid, bleach,

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.845 align:middle line:84%
then fried before it
went in the bottle.

00:08:04.845 --> 00:08:06.049 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these are
your average cheap oils

00:08:06.049 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:90%
you find in the grocery store.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.809 align:middle line:84%
Everything except
extra virgin olive oil.

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:09.474 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:09.474 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: It's treated
by a different process.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So when I found that out, then
found out 1% of the molecules

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:84%
are damaged, they turn
from natural to unnatural.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Life never made a
program for molecules

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
that didn't exist in nature.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.105 align:middle line:84%
They accumulate in
the body with age.

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And they also accumulate
up the food chain.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sick.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, OK, I can't
get healthy on oils like that.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:84%
We should be making them
with health in mind.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So I developed methods that take
care of these sensitive oils

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.882 align:middle line:84%
while they're being made and
also how they're being used.

00:08:40.882 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So why oils though?

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
How did oils come
into the portrait

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.025 align:middle line:84%
of healing from toxicity
from pesticides?

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Well, I was
looking at everything.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But oils became the one
that nobody was addressing.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And they're the most sensitive.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the kind of guy that
when I have a bunch of choices,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I say, OK, which
one am I going to do

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:90%
that will do the most good?

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And oils are going to be
the one because-- and now

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty clear-- more health
problems come from the damaged

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
oils and the way we use those
oils in food preparation

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:84%
than any other
part of nutrition.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
That means if we do it right--
so we make them with health

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.730 align:middle line:84%
in mind and we don't
use them for frying--

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.247 align:middle line:84%
then more health benefits
will come from giving the oils

00:09:24.247 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:90%
the care they need--

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --than any
other part of nutrition.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's a super food.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.825 align:middle line:90%
It comes from nuts.

00:09:28.825 --> 00:09:29.701 align:middle line:90%
It comes from seeds.

00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So why would I not
want to be involved with that.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:32.657 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:32.657 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So you did ultimately,
through using

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
the proper kinds of
healthy oils and so forth,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.112 align:middle line:90%
restore your health.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But you went on
and you really have

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:84%
spent the rest of
your life telling

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.289 align:middle line:90%
the story of healthy oils.

00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: I spend
a good part of it.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.097 align:middle line:84%
Although I'm interested in
the whole field of health--

00:09:49.097 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.721 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --and including
not just the physical,

00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:90%
but the mental, all of that.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:53.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: But this
was for me, that

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
was my first step because
I knew I could do this.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't ready yet
to do the bigger project.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
But I started in 1980.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.966 align:middle line:90%
So I've spent 30 years on it.

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, 30 years.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: The book
was published in 1986.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I developed flax oil in
1986 with some other people.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I developed a
blend of all the good things

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.519 align:middle line:84%
from oils and none
of the bad things.

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I developed that in 1994.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
in your Udo's Oil.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.645 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: That's Udo's Oil.

00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:22.533 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:24.472 align:middle line:84%
Which is a very high
quality product.

00:10:24.472 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
happened though while you

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.725 align:middle line:84%
were doing that and focusing
on the importance of fats

00:10:28.725 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:90%
and good fats in the diet.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, fats
were being demonized.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And we had these crazy
pyramids, these food pyramids,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
that had this much fat and
this much grain and carbo-- OK.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Here's one of the old pyramids.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So basically at the bottom, aha,
lots of pasta, lots of bread,

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.329 align:middle line:90%
lots of crackers.

00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.994 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:10:47.994 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
They put the carbs
on the bottom.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Six to seven servings a day.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So you should
eat lots of carbs they say

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.104 align:middle line:84%
and you should eat
very little oil.

00:10:56.104 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean
look at that now.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Six to seven servings of bread,
cereal, rice, and so forth.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Three to five of vegetables.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And then as you get into
your proteins and fats,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:90%
much, much less.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk
about what happened

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to the population
of this country,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
in Canada, when we
started adopting that.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: This came out
of the McGovern Report.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.884 align:middle line:84%
I think that was published
in the '70s or '80s.

00:11:18.884 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
followed it because that's

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.508 align:middle line:84%
the guideline from
the government for how

00:11:22.508 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:90%
we should eat.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So people started eating
more and more carbs.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all the
carb manufacturers

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.197 align:middle line:90%
were extremely happy.

00:11:29.197 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.488 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Right.

00:11:30.488 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And people started
avoiding fats.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason
they started avoiding fats

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
is people thought
that if you eat fat,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get fat.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there was
a saying, fat begets fat.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah-- fat.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's a logic to
it that's really simple.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.552 align:middle line:90%
It just turns out it's not true.

00:11:47.552 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:90%
That's not how biology works.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.301 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Grains beget fat.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So we ate less
fats and we ate more carbs.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And in 20 years,
overweight in North America

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.432 align:middle line:84%
went from 25% to 65%
of the population.

00:12:01.432 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.014 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And in
all that time, nobody

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
questioned the principles
on which that was based.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.032 align:middle line:84%
They said if everybody is
eating more carbs and less fats

00:12:10.032 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and they're getting fatter,--

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --then it
can't be the carbs--

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean it can't be the
fats that are doing that.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And that extended to
Canada, Australia.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:90%
That was also in Great Britain.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.217 align:middle line:84%
And the same phenomena
happened, massive weight gain.

00:12:23.217 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: It basically
traveled around the world.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we're at 65%,
maybe a little higher now.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And in Europe,
they're only at 50%.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And in Asia, they're
at maybe 30% now.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But they're all heading
in that same direction,

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.374 align:middle line:90%
pushing the carbs.

00:12:37.374 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
This is the Canadian--

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is the
same version of it in Canada.

00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:39.787 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:12:39.787 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:90%
We call it the grainbow.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:90%
The biggest thing is the grains.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.335 align:middle line:84%
And then fats again
are the littlest part.

00:12:45.335 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if you go
back to follow the money--

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --those
products on the outside

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
are much less expensive
to produce, especially

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:90%
when using trans fats.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Those are highly profitable.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Breads and pastries
and things like this

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that are mass produced
are much more profitable

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
than the organic-- and I don't
mean under organic procedures,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
but nature growing these other
nutrients and offering them.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Well, I think
carbs are easier to grow,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.310 align:middle line:90%
like if you're mass producing.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's not
how it was in nature

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.824 align:middle line:90%
before we invented agriculture.

00:13:17.824 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Grains were actually
hard to find.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have fields of
wheat, and potatoes, and rice,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.969 align:middle line:84%
and grains, and
all of that stuff.

00:13:24.969 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't produce it.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I know that those
are highly profitable

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and you'd see them
sitting there.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.162 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: But the other
thing is they're stable.

00:13:30.162 --> 00:13:30.786 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:30.786 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't go bad.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no lifeforce.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.851 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: You can
dry carbohydrates.

00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You can flip them on
a shelf for five years

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and take the dust off after
five years and eat them.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're still going to have
some food value, energy, fuel

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:90%
value.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do that with oils.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you can't.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.787 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, you can't
do that with those products.

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And you can't
do that with fresh foods.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you can't.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:58.181 align:middle line:84%
And I love really well-made
breads and things like that.

00:13:58.181 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:90%
I bake.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I make little gluten-free
cakes and everything.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But if those products
we're seeing there

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:84%
had the complete,
natural oils in them,

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:90%
they would not have shelf life.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Oh, that's correct.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.977 align:middle line:84%
So they take the grain and
they take the germ out.

00:14:16.977 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And then the oil is in the germ.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:84%
That would make the grain go
rancid when you ground it up.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:90%
So they take that out.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
They actually remove all
the oil from the grain

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.252 align:middle line:84%
in order to give this
flour a shelf life.

00:14:27.252 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.543 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: But what's
also interesting

00:14:29.543 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:84%
about this is that
carbohydrates are actually

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
the least important
food in our diet.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And why do I say that.?

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, oils, there are
essential nutrients

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:90%
that you have to get from oils.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
There are essential
amino acids that you

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:90%
have to get from protein.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:84%
There are essential
minerals and vitamins

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that you have to get
from whole foods.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
in carbohydrates

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:90%
that you can't get elsewhere.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:84%
There are no essentials
carbohydrates.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
That makes them the
least important food.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:90%
They're good for fuel.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat more than you
burn, and 65% of the population

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
does-- what I say to people is
if you eat carbohydrates either

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.634 align:middle line:84%
you burn them or you're
going to wear them.

00:15:10.634 --> 00:15:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Because the body is
forced to turn them into fat.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So I sometimes also call
them undeclared fats.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you think you're
eating carbs to get slim.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But you're actually
eating something--

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --your body,
it doesn't look like fat

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
when you eat it.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.923 align:middle line:90%
But your body turns it into fat.

00:15:25.923 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Turns it into fat.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And then
you get fat anyway.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.571 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're going
to talk about the fats that

00:15:30.571 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
are the good fats and the
fats that are the bad fats.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.267 align:middle line:84%
But there's a picture
I took at Whole Foods,

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in front of Whole
Foods the other day.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:90%
I was going to get some fruit.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:84%
This one, no artificial
trans fats since 2003.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Trans fats are trans fats.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.515 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean,
"artificial trans fats."

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:51.181 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: I'm not
sure what that means.

00:15:51.181 --> 00:15:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what that
means other than saying

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
dairy products have
some trans fats in them,

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:90%
a very small amount.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I figured out one day to
get 3 grams of trans fats

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.475 align:middle line:84%
from butter, you have to eat
a pound and a quarter a day.

00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.473 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to
the cooking of it.

00:16:03.473 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And if
you get it from beef,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to eat a lot more
beef than that to get it.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A whole cow, yeah.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:08.616 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:90%
So those are natural trans fats.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So maybe what they're
saying is, well, we

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:84%
have dairy products that
have trans fats in them.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But we have no artificial
trans fats since 2003.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if you could
go into Whole Foods-- and I

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.096 align:middle line:90%
don't know about this.

00:16:23.096 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean tell me--
in any health food

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.980 align:middle line:84%
store, the oils they
have on their shelves,

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:84%
if they have canola
oil, and safflower,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and sunflower, and all
these oils, are they

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.772 align:middle line:90%
generally untreated oils?

00:16:36.772 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Because those have to be
refrigerated and they're not

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.275 align:middle line:90%
refrigerated.

00:16:39.275 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:90%
They're sitting on the shelves.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But you're mixing
up two concepts.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.367 align:middle line:90%
The trans fats--

00:16:43.367 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --you will
find very small amounts

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:84%
in oils that have been
heated to high temperatures.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So all of the cooking and salad
oils that people usually have,

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
that are on the shelf, they
all have a little bit in it.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
But you can round it down to
zero because it's maybe not 1%.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So you will have some, but
labeling laws allow that.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:84%
The place where you would find
a lot of trans fats in a product

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:84%
called CLA, that is made out of
sunflower and sesame-- sorry,

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:90%
sunflower and safflower oils.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And they artificially heat
it to high temperature

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.357 align:middle line:90%
and the molecule twists.

00:17:23.357 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get
a trans fatty acid.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are those omega-6s?

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: These are omega-6s.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And 70% of CLA is
trans fatty acids.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.094 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 70%?

00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So if a store has those
in them, then they

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:90%
have trans fats in them.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.557 align:middle line:84%
Those would be artificially
made trans fats.

00:17:42.557 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
that sign says that,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
if they were to offer
the products, the CLA,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of one of the companies
that produces CLA--

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.065 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: That would
be in contradiction

00:17:52.065 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:90%
to what that says.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's in
contradiction to that sign.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: But I don't
know if they have it.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:55.332 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't either.

00:17:55.332 --> 00:17:57.881 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to find
out what does that mean.

00:17:57.881 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.005 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a
few different things.

00:18:00.005 --> 00:18:02.994 align:middle line:84%
So we have the artificial
trans fats, which are added in,

00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:84%
as you say, on occasion
to dairy and so forth.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
processing of oils.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:90%
They're totally denuded.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:84%
When you were talking about
that earlier in the show,

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
until you get to the
point where they actually

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.457 align:middle line:84%
have to heat it up to 425, are
their trans fats in those oils?

00:18:19.457 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: No.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They may
have residues--

00:18:20.965 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Because they're not
naturally present in the seeds.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.056 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of Drano and things.

00:18:24.056 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:90%
But-- no.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: The remnants.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.902 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.902 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean are there
really any remnants

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.299 align:middle line:90%
of these solvents in these oils?

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: When you
mix something in water,

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:84%
you can never get
it like 100% out.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to
be a little bit, traces.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:84%
In those amounts,
sodium hydroxide is OK.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not like good.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not like you want it.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:90%
But sodium is essential.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Hydroxides are part of nature.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So they're not
going to harm you.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The phosphoric acid,
all the pieces of that,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:90%
very small remnants.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.719 align:middle line:90%
But it's never completely out.

00:19:00.719 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.026 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Trans fat has to
be less than half a percent.

00:19:04.026 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Then you don't have to
put them on the label.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And you will have them in
those oils because of the heat

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:90%
that they've heated to.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you don't want
to have standard grocery store

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
oils that have been
through this really

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.417 align:middle line:90%
harsh and aggressive process?

00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Me, personally?

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: I don't use them.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't use them at all.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you can get oils
the way nature makes them,

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
the way life understands
how to use them

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:90%
and what to do with them.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
You can get those
from seeds and nuts.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.700 align:middle line:84%
You can get that from
certain animals that you eat,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:90%
if you eat animals.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on what they
get fed that determines that.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So wild animals are likely to
be better in their oil content

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:90%
than farmed animals.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can get
it from oils that

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
are made with health
in mind, that are not

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:84%
treated with Drano, window
washing acid, bleached,

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and fried.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And those oils will be
much better for you anyway.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can get them
from many sources.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to depend on
all those cooking and salad

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.374 align:middle line:90%
oils that have been damaged.

00:20:10.374 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
talk a little bit later

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
about the actual
process that you

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
need to use when you're using
them in any kind of cooking.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.699 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's
talk about olive oil.

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
We have a little clip
of a film in a second

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.334 align:middle line:84%
here about the old fashioned
way to make olive oil.

00:20:25.334 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
most ubiquitous

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.214 align:middle line:90%
of all of the healthy oils.

00:20:28.214 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about where
an olive oil has turned

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:90%
unhealthy though.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: The thing that's
made olive oil so unbelievably

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
popular is that it
is the only oil that

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.164 align:middle line:84%
is commonly available,
widespread available,

00:20:42.164 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that has not been treated with
Drano, window washing acid,

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.760 align:middle line:84%
bleached, and fried before
it went in the bottle.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the method
used-- the oil

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
comes out of the flesh,
not out of the seed.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need
those processes.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So they make it in
a different way.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:00.362 align:middle line:84%
And so that olive oil is
not damaged if it's fresh.

00:21:00.362 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then how do we
know when we're looking at it.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Some of it is almost clear.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It just says olive oil.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
The other says extra
virgin olive oil.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It'll have more
flavor, more color.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Extra virgin,
it should be green

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:84%
or it should be the color
of the olives it comes from.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:90%
It should have the olive flavor.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
You can take that oil
and treat it with Drano,

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
window washing acid,
bleach it, and fry it

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
clear olive oil.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And now what people are
also doing-- some people--

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
is because olive
oil is so popular,

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
but the trees grow
really slowly,

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:84%
so the world supply is
not as big as the demand--

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:84%
so what many people now do is
they mix the oil with canola

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:84%
oil, or soybean oil, or the
cheapest damaged oil they can.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:90%
They still sell it as olive oil.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of cheating going on.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
know whether they've

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
done that or not, if the oil
doesn't get hard in the fridge

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:90%
or at least get flecks of--

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Globules
that are solids, yeah.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --flecks
in the fridge,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.964 align:middle line:84%
then they've put in an oil
that keeps it more liquid.

00:22:03.964 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that would be one

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:90%
of the bad oils, the cheap oils.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: That will
be a doctored oil.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:09.255 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:09.255 --> 00:22:09.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a look
at this little video.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It's from Oliflix, which
is a very small mill.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:90%
There aren't that many left.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.744 align:middle line:90%
This one is in Spain.

00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is showing the process
by which they make the oil.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see it
in a minute here.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can see it
in the background.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:90%
It's I think made of granite.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:36.022 align:middle line:84%
It's an old stone grist
mill made of granite.

00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's just see here.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:90%
There we go, mashing the olives.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.640 align:middle line:90%
And why granite?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Because in a thousand
years, those same stones

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.329 align:middle line:90%
will still be doing it.

00:22:49.329 --> 00:22:49.911 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And then it's taken and it goes
through this kind of a mesh.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:01.435 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like a
burlap, this mesh here.

00:23:01.435 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It goes through this mesh.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.205 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it's dripping
down there on the sides.

00:23:06.205 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:84%
A very primitive
process this is.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's olive oil
I buy, by that way.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most
exquisite tasting olive

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:90%
oil I have ever had.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.355 align:middle line:90%
That's your oil.

00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:90%
It's bottled.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.175 align:middle line:84%
It's captured and
then it's bottled.

00:23:21.175 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And before the
big oil industry started,

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
they would do similar
things with other seeds.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.070 align:middle line:84%
They'd have like a
wedge, a wedge press.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.725 align:middle line:90%
You put a wooden wedge.

00:23:30.725 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a hardwood.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And then they would just
go and hit it with a mallet

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and that would squish the
seeds, a little bit of oil

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle line:90%
would drop out.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And the lady at the
house or the estate

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.497 align:middle line:84%
would go do laundry and
then feed cows or whatever

00:23:45.497 --> 00:23:46.080 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:46.579 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:23:46.579 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Every time she went by
there, she would bang it.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And then a few drops
of oil would come out.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how cold pressed
oils were originally made.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.096 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
term comes from.

00:23:57.096 --> 00:23:58.720 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
called cold hammered

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:90%
because they hammered the oil.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we didn't
consume a lot of them

00:24:02.215 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:84%
because they were so precious
and so time consuming

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.267 align:middle line:90%
to both grow and to make.

00:24:06.267 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And they
knew that that oil

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a oil shelf life.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:09.676 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:09.676 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So they did it on a
daily basis or a weekly basis.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, and the flavor.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And then
when the big presses

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
came along, they wanted
to make tons of it,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.020 align:middle line:90%
make it really fast.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.420 align:middle line:84%
They then called it cold
pressed because they wanted

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to give the indication that this
oil is as good as the oil that

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:84%
was made in the
wedge without heat.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And so they
called it cold pressed.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:90%
But they never defined the term.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So you can call
anything cold pressed.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they wanted
a long shelf life

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:84%
because oils by nature
have a short one.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they got into
Drano, window washing acid,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:84%
bleached, and fried because
they would remove things

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:90%
that make the oil spoil faster.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.125 align:middle line:84%
And those are for shelf
life, not for health.

00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:84%
So that company, the
one we saw the video,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.245 align:middle line:84%
I just put it because that's my
favorite olive oil, the Olifix.

00:25:02.245 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But other than them--
there are other companies

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that are still doing it
this old fashioned way.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you do it that
way, don't a lot of them,

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.304 align:middle line:84%
the nut oils in particular,
have to be refrigerated?

00:25:13.304 --> 00:25:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: If you
do it that way--

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Un-huh.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --they would
have to be refrigerated.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.766 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you
find them in your store,

00:25:18.766 --> 00:25:20.890 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
find a natural oil,

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:84%
you will find it in the
refrigerated section?

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.503 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: No.

00:25:23.503 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
What we created in
terms of making oils

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.685 align:middle line:84%
with health in mind, they
refrigerate it in the factory.

00:25:28.685 --> 00:25:30.940 align:middle line:84%
They're in cold
storage in the factory.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
They're cold storage
in the store.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
You keep them in
the refrigerator.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.256 align:middle line:84%
And you never use
them for frying.

00:25:40.256 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.796 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So we're using
oils very different.

00:25:42.796 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
You cook -- go back
to cooking in water.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And you add the oil when
the food comes off the heat.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, they need
to be refrigerated.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way you can get
a long shelf life on them.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you want a really long
shelf life, like the two year

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that they want for
the cooking oils,

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.619 align:middle line:84%
you have to freeze them
and freeze them solid.

00:26:00.619 --> 00:26:02.660 align:middle line:84%
When you freeze them solid,
molecules don't move,

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:84%
reactions don't happen, and
you get your two or three year

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:90%
shelf.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But they need that
kind of care if you

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:84%
want them to retain
their health benefits.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:12.720 align:middle line:90%
By nature, they have them.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you put them
through all that stuff,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
they lose a lot of
their health benefits.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we get to
what you just kind of alluded

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.324 align:middle line:84%
to a moment ago about
not cooking with them--

00:26:23.324 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
most people think, well, why
would you have all those oils

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and never cook
with them-- but you

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:90%
can use them with cooked food.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.016 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:31.784 align:middle line:90%
But let's go to butter first.

00:26:31.784 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And let's assume we're
talking about a quality

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.130 align:middle line:84%
butter, grass-fed
butter for example,

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:90%
an organic grass-fed butter.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:41.330 align:middle line:84%
How does that fit in with
the trans fat profiles?

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Because you said earlier, it
may have just a trace of it

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But when you heat it, it
seems to be more stable.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
A few oils are more stable
than other natural oils.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: But
it's not trans fats

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:90%
that make butter more stable.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: It's that most of the
oil in butter is actually fat.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:84%
It's fat because it's
solid at room temperature.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.450 align:middle line:84%
If it's liquid at room
temperature, we call it an oil.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no difference
in the chemistry.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But the saturated fats are
hard at room temperature.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why butter is
hard at room temperature.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And saturated fats are not
nearly as sensitive to damage

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:90%
by light, by oxygen, by heat--

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like coconut oil, too.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And
coconut as well, yes.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:25.565 align:middle line:90%
And cocoa butter--

00:27:25.565 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And cocoa butter.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: And shea butter.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.702 align:middle line:90%
So these are all hard fats.

00:27:29.702 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
They're used in
cosmetics and some people

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.905 align:middle line:90%
use them in food preparation.

00:27:32.905 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Because they contain very little
of the omega-6 and the omega-3,

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.060 align:middle line:84%
which are the essential
nutrients from oils.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And any time you
have a fat or oil

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:84%
with quite a bit of
omega-6 or omega-3 in it,

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%
it will be liquid and will
not go hard in the fridge.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:90%
But these are essential.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
them and you have

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:90%
to bring them in from outside.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But as I remember from
years ago-- I read your book.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh gosh, I think I
read it in the '90s,

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-90's
initially-- as I recall,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.980 align:middle line:84%
it's that you have to have
the blend of the three

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
in our diet because of
all the grains and such,

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.860 align:middle line:84%
really kind of topped out on
the omega-6s to the exclusion

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:84%
of the right balance with
omega3s for quite a long time.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't that the case?

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of our oils that we use
commercially have omega-6s,

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.160 align:middle line:84%
but very few of
them have omega-3s.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And if they have omega-3s,
usually not very much.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very practical
industry reason for that.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Is that omega-3s
are five times more

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.079 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to damage
than omega-6s.

00:28:44.079 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.038 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: So they're stable.

00:28:46.038 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So 6s are stable
compared to omega-3s.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's sunflower,
safflower, and others.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And sesame, and
peanuts, and almond.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
They all have omega-6s,
but no omega-3.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Flax is a really
rich source of omega-3.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.519 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
enough omega-6.

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well that's why
you did your beautiful blend.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.115 align:middle line:90%
The Udo's blend is amazing.

00:29:07.115 --> 00:29:09.198 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And that's the
point of making a blend.

00:29:09.198 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Now, olive oil
has more 9s, omega-9s.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.176 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Olive oil is mostly omega-9.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Omega-9 is not essential.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Your body can make it.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: It's good fuel.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:90%
But it's not essential.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.180 align:middle line:90%
What does "essential" mean?

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Essential means can't make it in
the body out of anything else.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Got to have it to
live and be healthy.

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, got to
get it from outside.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.930 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get enough,
your health goes down

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:90%
and you get deficiency symptoms.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're
degenerative in nature

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:90%
and they get worse with time.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get enough,
long enough, you die.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.569 align:middle line:90%
That's how important they are.

00:29:43.569 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: If you
bring them back in,

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:84%
in adequate quantities
before you die,

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:84%
then all of your problems
from not getting enough

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.370 align:middle line:84%
are reversed because
your life knows

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:84%
exactly what to do
with them, provided

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:84%
you take responsibility to
make sure enough of them

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
land in your body that
life can do its job.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:90%
The trend now is coconut oil.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of raw foodists--
coconut oil, coconut oil,

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:90%
coconut oil.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Is that more a spectrum of 9,
omega-9s, or omega-6, 3s, what?

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Olive oil
has lots of 9, about 10%

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.170 align:middle line:90%
omega-6, no omega-3s.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Coconut,
mostly saturated

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.160 align:middle line:84%
fats, many of the medium
chain and short-chain,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and has very little omega-6,
maybe the maximum is about 6%,

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:90%
and virtually no omega-3s.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of reasons
why coconut oil is popular.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.692 align:middle line:90%
One is it's harder.

00:30:37.692 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to cook with it,

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.939 align:middle line:84%
you get less health damage
than if you use liquid oils.

00:30:41.939 --> 00:30:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But you're still
going to get damage.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So my recommendation,
don't do it.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a cooling oil.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very good in summer
because it actually cools you.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a tropical oil and
it actually cools you,--

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the Ayurveda,
it's popular for pitas

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:53.661 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:30:53.661 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --whereas
omega-3s are warming oils.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're very good for
keeping you warm in winter.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.516 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest reason in my
book of why coconut is good

00:31:04.516 --> 00:31:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is it's good fuel and it's
better fuel than carbs.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:90%
You have to have fuel.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.470 align:middle line:84%
There's only two kinds of
fuel that you mostly have.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.425 align:middle line:90%
It's either carbs or it's fats.

00:31:14.425 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Fats do not turn on fat
production in the body.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Carbs do.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you're overweight
and you want fuel

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want to have
fuel that makes you overweight,

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.450 align:middle line:84%
that makes you get
cravings so you overeat,

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and does all of
that that carbs do,

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.810 align:middle line:84%
then you're better off eating
coconut as your source of fuel.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you do that, you still
need to get your omega-3s

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:90%
and 6s--

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --because
those your body

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
has to have because you
can't live without it.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was wondering is
the nutrients we need are not

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.220 align:middle line:84%
those that are present in
this new trend of almost

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.710 align:middle line:84%
exclusive coconut oil use
in a lot of households.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Correct.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:84%
You could say you could
take Udo's Oil as your oil

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and do that forever and
take no other oil ever.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do that with
butter, you cannot do that with

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:84%
coconut, and you cannot do that
with olive oil because you will

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:84%
not get the omega-3s and 6s
that you need if you do that.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.796 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And here's
your food pyramid.

00:32:15.796 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't cost
nearly as much

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.469 align:middle line:84%
as the government's
to put it together.

00:32:19.469 --> 00:32:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But this is what you've
come after all your years

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:90%
of research to.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: My joke
is they started

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:90%
making a new food pyramid.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were sending out
questionnaires to people.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And I work in nutrition
and I have a profile.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.890 align:middle line:90%
So they sent me one of those.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But you could only nibble around
the edges of the food pyramid.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't say you know what,
we need to completely change

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.380 align:middle line:90%
this stupid thing.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.200 align:middle line:90%
And I got mad.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And I flew to Japan.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, they're
going to not do it right.

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to do it the
way nature would do it,

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.860 align:middle line:84%
not the way government and
commercial interests do it.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But how was it in
nature, because that's

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.030 align:middle line:90%
where health came from.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So I said I'm going to
make my own food pyramid.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And it took them two years
to make the new food pyramid

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:90%
and it took me two hours.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.399 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So here's your two
hour food pyramid.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.165 align:middle line:90%
And what is it?

00:33:09.165 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So lots of
vegetables at the bottom.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.995 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: You cannot
go wrong on green food.

00:33:12.995 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:90%
You will not get fat on them.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.200 align:middle line:84%
They're rich in
minerals, the vitamins.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:90%
You cannot go wrong on it.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the other
non-starchy vegetables.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this now,
as I'm looking at this,

00:33:23.945 --> 00:33:27.715 align:middle line:84%
this becomes more like
a lot of people-- well,

00:33:27.715 --> 00:33:29.340 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to look
at the percentages--

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of people
embrace the Paleo diet,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.461 align:middle line:84%
which is vegetables, lots
of greens and proteins.

00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah, of course.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Before we had guns
and farms and stuff,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:84%
when the men went hunting, they
usually came home without meat.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.760 align:middle line:84%
If you come home without
meat, what do you eat?

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Vegetables.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Because plants don't run away.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:47.980 align:middle line:90%
They don't fight.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So they're really easy
to hunt down and kill.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's the Paleo diet.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the Paleo diet.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So Paleo is a combination
mostly of vegetables,

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and proteins, and
fats, and healthy fats.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.094 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at yours here.

00:34:02.094 --> 00:34:03.760 align:middle line:84%
That's how your pyramid
is looking also.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.468 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Right.

00:34:04.468 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So the second in-- so when
people say what should I eat,

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I always say greens,
good oils, and proteins.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the proteins get
you essential amino acids.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The good oils get you
essential fatty acids.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.150 align:middle line:90%
You have to have those.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the greens, you're going
to get minerals and vitamins

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:90%
and lots of medicinal things.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So greens, good
fats, and proteins,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.072 align:middle line:90%
that's the Paleo diet, right?

00:34:26.072 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Um-huh.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.279 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:27.279 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Now, I went
up the food pyramid

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.830 align:middle line:90%
and said, OK, now fuels.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:36.389 align:middle line:84%
Carbs and fats are
fuel and so is fruit.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
And the more active you
are, the more of those

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:44.070 align:middle line:84%
you can burn without
getting problems.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And the less active you are,
the less of them you should eat.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.429 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to do it is
make good fats your main source

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:56.440 align:middle line:84%
of fuel because they'll
increase your energy levels,

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:84%
they'll increase
thermogenesis, they'll

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:90%
turn on body fat burning.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So they keep you from
getting overweight.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.800 align:middle line:84%
They also turn off
fat production.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
do a fuel switch.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Either you're going to
get your main fuel as oils

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to get
your main fuel as carbs.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
If you take good oil
on top of the carbs,

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:90%
the body makes the carbs.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.519 align:middle line:90%
You can actually put on weight.

00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: So fuel.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.190 align:middle line:90%
And how much?

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Never eat more
fuel than you burn.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that makes sense.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.707 align:middle line:90%
Basically, numbers work.

00:35:31.707 --> 00:35:33.290 align:middle line:84%
We are an engine
with a certain number

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.498 align:middle line:90%
of calories you burn per day.

00:35:34.498 --> 00:35:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And then on top--
and why the separation is--

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.800 align:middle line:84%
white foods and burned foods,
white flour, white sugar,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.750 align:middle line:90%
white rice--

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.083 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Refined carbohydrates.

00:35:44.083 --> 00:35:45.732 align:middle line:90%


00:35:45.732 --> 00:35:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --I have a
longer list-- white oils,

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:84%
white proteins like
the protein powder.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.057 align:middle line:90%
It's very highly processed.

00:35:51.057 --> 00:35:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.348 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Right.

00:35:52.348 --> 00:35:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So those, and the burnt
foods, whatever you fried,

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.600 align:middle line:84%
baked-- the fried part
and the baked part--

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:84%
those reduce or
avoid-- and really I

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:06.230 align:middle line:84%
should take out the
"reduce" and just say avoid.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
nutrient deficient,

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.387 align:middle line:84%
they're processing damage, and
they're going to make you sick.

00:36:11.387 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you have of
course other supplements,

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.250 align:middle line:84%
up at the top, enzymes,
probiotics, antioxidants,

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.436 align:middle line:84%
fiber, phytonutrients,
vitamins, and minerals,

00:36:19.436 --> 00:36:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and that makes sense.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, that makes sense.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot
of people are turning to

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:90%
and are losing weight.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.934 align:middle line:84%
And they're feeling
a lot better.

00:36:24.934 --> 00:36:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Their minds are
clear and so forth.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And I actually
eat like that And I'm 71.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you look
great and you have--

00:36:30.925 --> 00:36:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Whoo.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --a ton of energy.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: I have
lots of energy.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:33.981 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:33.981 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the actual
cooking process itself now.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful
that I learned

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.929 align:middle line:84%
about your work all
those years ago.

00:36:40.929 --> 00:36:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Well, you were
the first person who actually

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.547 align:middle line:90%
changed her recipes--

00:36:44.547 --> 00:36:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --on the
basis of understanding

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.080 align:middle line:84%
the damage done by
oils in cooking.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that
was the only-- yeah.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: You're a
pioneer in the deal.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think those cooking
shows were the first and up

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.200 align:middle line:84%
until very recently
the only shows that

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.920 align:middle line:84%
used that particular cooking
method and the cookbooks too.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So I feel very proud that I
was able to offer that service.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:06.659 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And I'm very proud of
you for taking that high road.

00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well once I
knew the information,

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to ignore it.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Except you know what,
setting higher standards

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.756 align:middle line:90%
is always a deliberate decision.

00:37:16.756 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.963 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And a lot of people
don't make that decision.

00:37:19.963 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And what's beautiful
about it is you

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.220 align:middle line:84%
made a deliberate
decision to do something

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.780 align:middle line:84%
that's actually in
some ways harder

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.609 align:middle line:84%
to do because it doesn't
go along with the flow.

00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was not
that big a fix honestly.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:32.270 align:middle line:84%
What I found, there
were some things

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:84%
that you have to modulate
when you're cooking,

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:37.300 align:middle line:84%
where you're not going
to get this kind of burnt

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.770 align:middle line:84%
crust that some people
like on certain items,

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.570 align:middle line:90%
where it tastes good.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was a
simple fix, which

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.532 align:middle line:90%
was simply cook your food.

00:37:45.532 --> 00:37:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Do what you have to do.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But then add the oils in later
in the presence of liquid

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:84%
because liquid can only
boil to 212 Fahrenheit.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.005 align:middle line:90%
And how simple is that, really?

00:37:56.005 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.669 align:middle line:90%
You can't burn food in water.

00:37:58.669 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:90%
You can't burn oils in water.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.885 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: You can only burn
food when the water goes out

00:38:02.885 --> 00:38:05.880 align:middle line:84%
of the food and you need
higher temperatures than water

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And oil, of course, boils at
a much higher temperature.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:14.934 align:middle line:84%
So instead of 212, it's
like 245, or 180 even.

00:38:14.934 --> 00:38:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't find it
really that big a switch.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And the viewers-- I had a lot of
viewers across America, Canada,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and Australia and
no one complained

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.649 align:middle line:84%
that it was too
complicated to do.

00:38:25.649 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: I was inspired by
you doing that because I thought

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.500 align:middle line:90%
you were inspired to do it.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as
it turns out, what

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I realized in the
process-- and I

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:84%
wrote about this
in my cookbooks--

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:84%
was that the foods,
especially when you're dealing

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:43.180 align:middle line:84%
with vegetables, you're doing
cooked vegetable dishes,

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.540 align:middle line:84%
when you are sauteing
your onions, peppers,

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, I would
saute it in a liquid

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.420 align:middle line:84%
of some kind, either
water or a broth.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And then because I like
the richness and flavor

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.750 align:middle line:84%
of the oils, add them in toward
the very end of that process,

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.540 align:middle line:84%
but not after it was
fully dehydrated.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.600 align:middle line:84%
The foods had a
sparkle and retained

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:84%
their own natural
flavor and sparkle,

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that they lose when you're
sauteing in oils and fats.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: In fact, I
remember you telling me

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:84%
the only thing you can't do
without oils is burn your food.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely true.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about--
there's a subject

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.280 align:middle line:84%
that I'm sure some people
watching are thinking.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, we've been talking
about Udo's Oil.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And there are other flaxseed
oils out there as well.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
krill oils and there

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:84%
are other oils that are
made from fish, fish oils.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Why do you prefer
vegetable based?

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Others argue you have
to have fish base?

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So what's the truth on
this from your perspective?

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: The fish
oil, flax oil argument

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.130 align:middle line:84%
has been misrepresented
from the week

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.299 align:middle line:90%
that we started making flax oil.

00:39:47.299 --> 00:39:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.420 align:middle line:90%
So there's that 3-6-9 blend.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And it
was misrepresented

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:84%
by people in the
fish oil industry.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And here's what's wrong
with the argument.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.385 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, the body
can't convert flax.

00:39:58.385 --> 00:39:59.670 align:middle line:90%
You got to have fish oil.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Here's what's wrong
with the argument.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.446 align:middle line:84%
We're doing two completely
different things.

00:40:05.446 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
When you talk
about supplements--

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.590 align:middle line:90%
do you take supplements?

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: OK.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So do you ever take supplement
and just forget about the food?

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.089 align:middle line:90%
I mean for long term?

00:40:15.089 --> 00:40:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: No.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.317 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:40:16.317 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because you need food.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.115 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Because
it's completely crazy.

00:40:19.115 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because it's crazy.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: So you eat your food.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:23.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need it
for fuel and many things.

00:40:23.748 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So food
is your basis.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.139 align:middle line:84%
And then you supplement
your food with a supplement.

00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:29.763 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
a "supplement"--

00:40:29.763 --> 00:40:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: --not a "instead of."

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.990 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
oils, that's true too.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.220 align:middle line:84%
You have food oils and
you have supplement oils.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Fish is a supplement oil.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Krill is a supplement oil.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:49.264 align:middle line:90%
Udo's Oil is a food oil.

00:40:49.264 --> 00:40:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is one a food.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.215 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Why is that considered
a food oil, versus that

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.035 align:middle line:90%
from a fish, a supplement?

00:40:56.035 --> 00:41:00.286 align:middle line:90%


00:41:00.286 --> 00:41:02.454 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Because the
amount that you need.

00:41:02.454 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Because one is in a
minute-- and Udo's Oil,

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.410 align:middle line:90%
you can use in salads.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:90%
You take it as a food.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Well, what I do is I
recommend that people take two

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to four tablespoons of the
Udo's Oil, mixed in food,

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.190 align:middle line:84%
spread out over the
course of the day.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.360 align:middle line:84%
That's about the same amount as
they take of the cooking oils.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Those are not supplement oils.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.117 align:middle line:84%
Those are cooking
oil, food oils.

00:41:26.117 --> 00:41:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Food oils.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.241 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And what I'm saying
is get rid of those oils

00:41:29.241 --> 00:41:32.600 align:middle line:84%
because they're
damaged and toxic.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.243 align:middle line:84%
And replace them with oils
made with health in mind.

00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Don't fry the
oils made with health in mind

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.121 align:middle line:84%
then you'll wreck them
and make them toxic.

00:41:40.121 --> 00:41:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we
didn't really go into that.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.725 align:middle line:90%
Talk about the temperature.

00:41:43.725 --> 00:41:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go ahead.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: I'll do
that in a second.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.543 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: OK.

00:41:46.543 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting
your food oils.

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you can take a
supplement on top of that.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.190 align:middle line:90%
You take maybe 1 to 3 grams.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:00.904 align:middle line:84%
By the way, two to four
tablespoons, 28 to 56 grams.

00:42:00.904 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's quite a bit.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a bit.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Fish oil,
it's like 1 to 3 grams

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.128 align:middle line:90%
is what they recommend.

00:42:05.128 --> 00:42:07.339 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference
between food and supplement.

00:42:07.339 --> 00:42:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So when you've got
your food base done properly,

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.990 align:middle line:84%
then you can take a
supplement and see

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.410 align:middle line:90%
if you get further benefits.

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that would
be like the krill oil

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.010 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:21.676 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:42:21.676 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I prefer krill to fish
because krill is not damaged.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:24.686 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:24.686 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So then if
you get benefits from it,

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:29.820 align:middle line:90%
well then you stick with it.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
get any benefits,

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:90%
then you don't need it.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if you get enough
of the omega-3s and 6s

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:84%
in their plant-based
form, you have

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.470 align:middle line:84%
all the genes in your body to
convert them into EPA and DHA,

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:46.160 align:middle line:84%
which is what you get in the
supplements, in your own body.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.820 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem is we don't
get enough starting material

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.660 align:middle line:84%
for the conversion
of the omega-3s.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So I said let's
fix that problem.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but more
problems, more health problems,

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:04.170 align:middle line:84%
come from getting a bad
food oil foundation than

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.364 align:middle line:84%
come from whether you
take a supplement or not.

00:43:06.364 --> 00:43:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So let's fix
the big problem first.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.510 align:middle line:84%
If you have a problem with
your food oil foundation,

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:14.630 align:middle line:90%
a supplement will not fix that.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.097 align:middle line:90%
You have to fix the foundation.

00:43:16.097 --> 00:43:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: That's
why I like that.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Now in terms of how
to use it in terms

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.100 align:middle line:84%
of the temperature,
the high temperature,

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.580 align:middle line:84%
oils are damaged by light,
by oxygen, and by heat.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.345 align:middle line:84%
I've already said that
and I'll keep saying it.

00:43:30.345 --> 00:43:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say we get
those beautiful, fresh oils

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and now you want
to saute something.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have a slogan for that.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.069 align:middle line:90%
Fried oils fry health.

00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: OK.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Oils are vindictive.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.198 align:middle line:84%
They're going to treat
you like you treat them.

00:43:45.198 --> 00:43:46.920 align:middle line:84%
If you fry them,
they'll fry you.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: If you
treat them with care,

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.040 align:middle line:90%
they will take care of you.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So really, just
don't do that to them.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Don't heat them.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Don't do it.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.956 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can heat
them to a small extent.

00:43:57.956 --> 00:43:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Frying
is the worst thing

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:84%
we have ever invented
to do to our food

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.000 align:middle line:84%
in all of human history,
the single worst thing.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Because when you fry, you burn.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.070 align:middle line:84%
You burn starches, you burn
proteins, you burn the oils.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you change molecules.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Those molecules
accumulate in the body.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.830 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't know
what to do with them.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:24.410 align:middle line:90%
They create inflammation.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is a
background factor

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.180 align:middle line:84%
behind most of the
degenerative conditions.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And we call them
diseases of civilization

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:33.720 align:middle line:84%
sometimes or diseases
of processing

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
because it's the processing
that changes the molecules.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And the increased cancer--
starch turns into acrylamide.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.684 align:middle line:84%
Proteins turn into acrolein
and other toxic molecules.

00:44:50.684 --> 00:44:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And the other molecules, there's
a whole bunch of different ways

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:54.180 align:middle line:90%
it's damaged.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.880 align:middle line:84%
All three of them,
independent of the others,

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.810 align:middle line:90%
increase risk of cancer.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what the research says.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this up.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And in
my view, processing

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.960 align:middle line:84%
is the thing where most of
our degenerative diseases

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.635 align:middle line:90%
come from.

00:45:07.635 --> 00:45:08.218 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:08.218 --> 00:45:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: You start with
fresh, whole, raw, organic.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:90%
That's nature's standard.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
That's how every creature eats
except for us and the animals

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:15.041 align:middle line:90%
that we feed.

00:45:15.041 --> 00:45:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: Fresh,
whole, raw, organic.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And every step you
take away from that

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:22.350 align:middle line:84%
will cost you something
in health at some point.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
like it, then you

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.700 align:middle line:84%
take steps back in the direction
of fresh, whole, raw, organic

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.610 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And you will get something back
in health when you do that.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:45:32.493 --> 00:45:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: So you go from
frying to cooking in water.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.930 align:middle line:84%
You go from cooking
in water to steaming.

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.240 align:middle line:84%
You go from steaming to
fresh, whole, raw, organic

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.590 align:middle line:90%
as much as you can.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.991 align:middle line:84%
If it's contaminated of course,
you have to kill the bugs.

00:45:44.991 --> 00:45:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But you probably
shouldn't be eating

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.489 align:middle line:84%
if it is contaminated,
dead or alive.

00:45:48.489 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.988 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:45:49.988 --> 00:45:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And then someone else has picked
up on your cooking methods.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Alan wrote-- how do you
say his name, Roettinger?

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Roettinger.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Roettinger.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Roettinger, yeah.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have this
new book, "Omega 3 Cuisine."

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:02.240 align:middle line:90%
And he's a top-notch chef.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.407 align:middle line:84%
And there is some really--
I just went through here.

00:46:04.407 --> 00:46:05.698 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I'm going to steal it.

00:46:05.698 --> 00:46:06.820 align:middle line:90%
And there's some really--

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:06.905 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Yeah.

00:46:06.905 --> 00:46:07.640 align:middle line:90%
You can take it.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's some
lovely recipes in here.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:10.700 align:middle line:84%
You realize I did
this-- I mean I've

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.180 align:middle line:90%
done it for years and years.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not a big
adjustment in the diet

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.517 align:middle line:84%
and everything
tastes just fabulous.

00:46:16.517 --> 00:46:17.600 align:middle line:90%
No onion rings, obviously.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.683 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: But in fact if
you don't burn the food,

00:46:19.683 --> 00:46:23.180 align:middle line:84%
you actually get so much
more of the subtle nuances

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.250 align:middle line:90%
of flavors in foods.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:25.040 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: And you
kill those with burnt.

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.800 align:middle line:84%
You can still taste--
I always called

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.270 align:middle line:90%
it the sparkle in the food.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Udo, we're just
about out of time.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And just one more--
anything else that you

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.500 align:middle line:84%
want to add to this that we
haven't touched on already?

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Well, yes.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.450 align:middle line:90%
But now, that goes far afield.

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:43.127 align:middle line:84%
I get asked all
the time why is it

00:46:43.127 --> 00:46:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that people know a lot of things
that they could do for better

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:47.780 align:middle line:90%
health and they don't do them?

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.364 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:46:48.364 --> 00:46:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ERASMUS: --I've
thought about that a lot.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It's always comes down to
if your life is crappy,

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.680 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to take care of it.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So the reason people don't
do what they know to do

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is because they don't
feel good enough

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.280 align:middle line:84%
within themselves
about being alive.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm really big
on cultivating some way

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.440 align:middle line:84%
to be fully present
in your own life.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you are, you get
what an incredible gift it is.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
going to be much more

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.680 align:middle line:84%
likely to take care of
the body because you

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.735 align:middle line:84%
want to prolong the beauty of
the experience of being alive.

00:47:24.735 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for making
that final comment

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.290 align:middle line:90%
because it's true.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The more depressed
we are, the more

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.780 align:middle line:84%
we reach for the
worst quality of foods

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to get an artificial
buzz from it.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:35.585 align:middle line:84%
And quite the
opposite when you're

00:47:35.585 --> 00:47:37.710 align:middle line:84%
feeling good about life
and you're committed to it.

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're a wonderful
example of that.

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.495 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Thank you.

00:47:40.495 --> 00:47:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at
71, wow, what skin.

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's just shining
through the rest of it.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.112 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Udo.

00:47:47.112 --> 00:47:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ERASMUS: Thank you, Regina.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.710 align:middle line:90%
I hope this has been helpful.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I think there has been an
intentional obstruction

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.370 align:middle line:84%
of the truth in this
particular area or else

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:55.875 align:middle line:90%
at least willful ignorance.

00:47:55.875 --> 00:47:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I personally go
way out of my way

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.297 align:middle line:90%
to find the most pristine oils.

00:47:59.297 --> 00:48:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And now you know that you
can do the same as well.

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile to connect
with Udo's book,

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.470 align:middle line:84%
you can go to Amazon.com or
any other major bookseller,

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:07.680 align:middle line:90%
as the new book.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.170 align:middle line:84%
The old one, "Fats That
Heal, Fats That Kill,"

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:84%
the original is the
bible of fats and oils.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.840 align:middle line:84%
His healthy fats
products are also

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.241 align:middle line:84%
available at health food
stores around the world,

00:48:17.241 --> 00:48:18.240 align:middle line:90%
in many, many countries.

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
