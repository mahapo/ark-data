00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:27.620 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE MORTER:
Formerly an OB-GYN,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Ed Park has witnessed
hundreds of births.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:10%
Now he's seeing hundreds
of what he calls re-births.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:10%
He's with us today
to discuss why

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:10%
we age in his new book,
"The Telomere Miracle."

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Welcome Dr. Park,
to "Healing Matrix."

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ED PARK: Thank you so much.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Wonderful
to have you here.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Thank you.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what is the
current theory of aging?

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:10%
>>ED: I think aging has
to do with five things.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:10%
It has to do with cell birth,
maintenance, destruction,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:10%
and it has to do with
time and entropy.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So I really went from my first
book being all about telomeres,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:84%
to now I have sort of like
a five-dimensional view

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:90%
in this most recent book.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you say
more about that?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Initially, you know, they say
if all you have is a hammer,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:90%
everything looks like a nail.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So I got really excited
because in taking

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.026 align:middle line:84%
a telomerase activator 11
years ago, I lost weight,

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I threw away my reading
glasses, my hair turned black,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's still, at
52, it's pretty black.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And so all my patients
were telling me,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, Dr. Park,
has anybody told you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
that the telomeres I activated
helped their diabetes

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.755 align:middle line:84%
or their depression
of their addiction,

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and I said, no, no, no,
until a few people told me,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and then I would do a webinar
and put that on YouTube.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So I started to realize that
telomerase, oh my God, maybe

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:90%
this is causing all diseases.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But now that I've gone 12
years along this journey,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I realized that that's
only one aspect.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
If you can maintain
the cells longer,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
it's like having
a car for longer.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:84%
It's good, but you still
have to replace the parts.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:10%
So there's aspects of
stem cell depletion, which

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:10%
I like to use the analogy of the
Hindu three gods or trimurti.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.407 align:middle line:84%
So you need to preserve your
stem cells, that's the Brahma.

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Vishnu is what I've been
doing for 12 years, which

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.018 align:middle line:84%
is maintaining the telomeres,
keeping those cells alive.

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But now people are
trying to research

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:90%
the Shiva or the destruction.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So they have this thing
called senolytics.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So we've known that
things like quercetin,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:84%
curcumin, if you take them,
they can accelerate the demise

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:90%
or the apoptosis of cells.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So I really look at it as
a five-dimensional thing.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the cell
birth, the maintenance

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and destruction, but
then we've got time also,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and time, we're not
perpetual motion machines,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:84%
we start to accumulate
errors, which

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:84%
is the fifth dimension,
which is entropy.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So even if under
perfect circumstances,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
you're going to make errors
in your DNA copy cell to cell,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:90%
mother to daughter.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But also, the epigenetics, which
is the software, if you will,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:90%
that's not 100%.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
It's probably ironically
over 100% efficient.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So as we get older,
a lot of our genes

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:84%
are turned off in a
process called methylation.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.927 align:middle line:90%
So five dimensions.

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, that was kind
of long-winded, but yeah.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.302 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Well no, no, it's great.

00:03:10.302 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So what we were
basically looking at is,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
there is a creation, a
sustaining and a deconstruction

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:84%
of every cell in our
body, and the chromosomes

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:84%
are playing a role in
how this takes place.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
In the telomeres and
the telomerase context,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
is showing us how
rapidly that will happen

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
or how we can preserve
a more youthful state

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.335 align:middle line:90%
for longer periods of time.

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:34.135 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I would back it up to--

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talk about what
are the theories of aging?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason I focus
on telomeres so much

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
is because there is a natural
model of aging called progeria.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So you see these Make a Wish
kids that are like 13 years old

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:90%
and they're bald and wrinkled.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that this is
a perfect model for aging.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
If you have a defect
in one of the genes

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
from your mom and dad of
any of the components that

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
make telomerase active
or the re-lengthening,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going to die
of old age at 13.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Now you and I, presumably,
we have two good copies

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:84%
of everything, so we're
going to last into our 80s,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
hopefully-- well
hopefully longer.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So there is a solid
biological model

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
for this form of
accelerated aging.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.399 align:middle line:84%
So that's why that is one
way into aging and one way

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:90%
to mitigate it.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But again, we can't ignore the
other four dimensions of it.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
As we get older, our
Brahma, if you will,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:90%
our stem cells deplete.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So you start out with one in
10,000 in your bone marrow

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
is a stem cell, a
mesenchymal stem cell.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:84%
When we get into our
100's, they're very rare.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.177 align:middle line:84%
So part of it is
depletion again, yeah.

00:04:40.177 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So let's break this down.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
The Brahma, you're saying,
and Brahma in the trimurti

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:90%
is the creator.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the creative essence,
the creative force, et cetera.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Right.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you're
saying that in the body,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:84%
the stem cell is the example
of that creative energy source.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the longer all of
this is working together,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
the more we can stay
in a recreative pattern

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:90%
in our own systems.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:84%
We keep generating
new healthy cells,

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:84%
we keep reproducing
and creating as we're

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:90%
intended to be able to do.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:84%
If you look at animals like
squid or other invertebrates

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
that have a nice,
warm ocean to live in,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
they can grow and be
immortal, allegedly,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and they have a high
proportion of stem cells.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So young people don't
have to try to be young,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
old people don't
have tried to be old.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Part of what makes
us young or old

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:84%
is the number and the quality of
our Brahma creator stem cells.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know for a fact that
the assayed a Dutch lady

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
in her 100's, and she only had
two types of stem cells left.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just like
having a cell phone.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
You bring it out of the
box with 100% charge,

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and eventually when you're
old, there's no more charge.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then a Vishnu
is this sustaining,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:84%
being able to maintain a
healthy environment where

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:90%
we're not prematurely aging.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Is this how you're correlating
it to this trimurti experience?

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Right.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we use the analogy,
how does stem cells maintain?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
They maintain with
telomerase activity.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.785 align:middle line:84%
So if you study like an
Ashkenazi Jewish population,

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the people
with high telomerase activity,

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
they have a higher
chance of reaching 100.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So-- and that analogy
holds true in--

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
certain bristlecone pines
that live 5,000 years,

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
or if you compare a
species of finches.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So it appears that telomerase
activity confers longer life.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But then we run up against
the third god, which is Shiva.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep your car
running with the old parts,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
they accumulate more
gene silencing--

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that's what we call
epigenetic changes.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So you keep that carburetor
running for 200,000, 400,000,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
500,000 miles, maybe it's not
such a good carburetor anymore.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So part of the healthy process
of cell ecology is destruction.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.165 align:middle line:90%
We want bad cells to go away.

00:06:57.165 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the Shiva
is the destroyer.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's create,
sustain, destroy,

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and-- just sharing this
so that all of our viewers

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
can really understand
this cycle,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:90%
create, sustain, destroy.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:84%
We want this deconstructive
process to happen in the body

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
naturally so that we're getting
rid of possible mutations

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and the recreation of cancerous
disease type processes

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
or chronic degenerative
conditions, yes?

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.728 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we just don't want
it to be out of balance,

00:07:22.728 --> 00:07:24.967 align:middle line:84%
we want a harmonious
process here.

00:07:24.967 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: I mean, without
our even trying,

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:90%
this has always happened.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
We're operating at 90-something
percent efficiency.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:84%
If we're suddenly unable
to maintain the telomeres

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
or we're unable to destroy the
bad cells, we go out of balance

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.882 align:middle line:90%
and we accelerate our aging.

00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And sure, we have
control over that

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
with our mindset and our
energy and physiology,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:90%
but a lot of is just automatic.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, the destruction,
Shiva is not a bad thing,

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:90%
it's a good thing.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Just like in tarot,
the death card

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.988 align:middle line:90%
is rebirth or new beginnings.

00:07:55.988 --> 00:07:57.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't look at a
tree in autumn and say,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
well it's so sad that those
leaves died and turned orange,

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.532 align:middle line:84%
some cells are supposed
to die and slough off.

00:08:03.532 --> 00:08:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's a
holographic universe.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:84%
This is happening in the cycles
of our lives and all the way

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
down to our cells,
and what you're

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
saying is all the way
down to the stem cell,

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
this same principle
is holding true.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
That we are actually a universal
being compacted into a body,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.053 align:middle line:84%
and this process is
happening right here

00:08:20.053 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:90%
at the cellular level.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:21.285 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like those great fractal
gifts on the internet,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
The process of creation,
maintenance, destruction

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
happens on a cellular level,
organ level, as people,

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.104 align:middle line:90%
as family--

00:08:34.104 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Projects in life and
our families, et cetera, yeah.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:84%
It's a very effective
way to approach anytime

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
health care, because it

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.720 align:middle line:84%
allows us to really work with
these universal concepts.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And anytime we're in
touch with the universe,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
we're definitely
headed in a direction

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
of understanding what holistic
health care is all about.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to the main reason
that Dr. Park is here today--

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
aging chromosomes, and
specifically, telomeres.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
telomeres and telomerase.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:10%
>>ANNOUNCER: The question has
been taken up by scientists--

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:10%
exploring immortality upon a
new frontier within the nucleus

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:10%
of our cells.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:10%
It is here where we find little
packets of genetic material

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:10%
called genes arranged a long
twisted, double-stranded

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:10%
molecules of DNA
called chromosomes.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:10%
The tip of the chromosomes
are capped with telomeres,

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle line:10%
and it is here
where we may finally

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.578 align:middle line:10%
unlock the secrets of
the Fountain of Youth.

00:09:29.578 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:10%
>>BILL ANDREWS: If you think of
a chromosome like a shoelace,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:10%
that caps or aglets
on your shoelaces

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:10%
are equivalent to the
telomeres on our chromosomes.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:10%
The telomere protects
the chromosome.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:10%
>>PATRICK FLANAGAN: And they're
actually made up of DNA codes.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:10%
And when our cells
divide, they break off.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:10%
And every time they break
off, it prevents the cells

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:10%
from dividing that many times.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WOLFE: With
every cell replication,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.805 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of that
chromosome is lost.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:10%
With every cell, let's
say it's a white blood

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:10%
cell, muscle cell, or a heart
cell, we lose a little bit.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't make much of a
difference in a year or 10

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:10%
years or 15 years or 30
years, but in 100 years,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.845 align:middle line:10%
it makes a huge difference.

00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:10%
>>PATRICK: We all know that
when the aglets on our shoelaces

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.498 align:middle line:10%
get shorter, our shoelaces
start to fall apart.

00:10:17.498 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:10%
Well, the same is true
for our chromosomes.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>>ANNOUNCER: With over 10,000
scientific articles published

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:10%
about telomeres, scientists
have been working hard

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:10%
to unlock the key to aging.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:10%
In 2009, the Nobel Prize
for physiology and medicine

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:10%
was awarded to
three scientists who

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:10%
discovered how an enzyme,
called telomerase,

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.785 align:middle line:10%
impacts telomere length.

00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So let's recap.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.445 align:middle line:84%
All of our chromosomes
have telomeres.

00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Mm-hmm.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And only the
chromosomes in stem

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:90%
cells have telomerase happening.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: In a nutshell, yeah.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Telomerase keeps stem
cells relatively immortal.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what is your theory
on stem cell and telomere

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and aging put together?

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:90%
What is your theory there?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I sort of come at it
from a different point of view.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And we see all this correlation
between all the diseases

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
of aging and short
dysfunctional telomeres.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So my theory, which I think
in a couple of decades

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.410 align:middle line:84%
will become quite orthodox
and quite obvious,

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.077 align:middle line:84%
is that when you have a
mutation in a regular skin cell

00:11:21.077 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
or what have you, your
intestines, you don't care,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:90%
it's supposed to slough off.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a mutation
in one of your stem cells,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
then you have a
dysfunctional lineage.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:84%
All the daughters are
somewhat messed up,

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
disease and aging

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.537 align:middle line:84%
is a downstream
manifestation of that.

00:11:38.537 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the mechanism
here is that when

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
the telomeres
shorten, they actually

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:90%
combine and cause mutation.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's not any kind
of crazy wild thing,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that's just science.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.690 align:middle line:90%
we see that all the time.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you have slight
changes in your stem cells,

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking about like
a Jimmy Olsen regular cell,

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
we're talking
about a Clark Kent.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So that cell is not going to
easily die, it's immortal,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:90%
and it's producing disease.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Let's take a
look at some telomeres.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And can you explain what
we're seeing on screen?

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a comparison of I
believe young chromosomes

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
versus chromosomes
with short telomeres.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you just explain
a little bit?

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: So these are
chromosomes, and at the tips,

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:84%
they're yellow
because they've been

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
labeled with a radioisotope
to make them glow.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So on the left, this could be
from a young healthy person.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:10%
Everything's great, we
have long telomeres.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
On the right, this might be
from an older person or somebody

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:90%
with disease.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So if this is a stem cell on
the liver of a drinker who's

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
70, what you see is
that some of the tips

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:90%
don't have any yellow glow.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
The telomeres have shortened
to the point where--

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and this is where the
bad magic happens.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Is that the cell will
look through that

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:90%
and say, ah, a naked end.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.340 align:middle line:90%
That must be a break.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And it'll actually splice
together, reconnect chromosomes

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.815 align:middle line:90%
that shouldn't be connected.

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:03.565 align:middle line:84%
And this is the mechanics
of what happens.

00:13:03.565 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And the next time
a cell divides,

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
if it even gets past the
checkpoint for division,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
the chromosomes will
be ripped apart,

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:90%
and you've got massive mutation.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:90%
And this process is bad.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like basically taking
a nice row of scallions

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.075 align:middle line:90%
and just chopping them up.

00:13:19.075 --> 00:13:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The process, then,
of a disease process,

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
a tumor, cancerous
conditions get

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
started under these mutated
versions of our cell

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.230 align:middle line:90%
replication.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
basic physiology

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
of one type of aging, which
is that if the telomeres

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
in our stem cells shorten,
it will always 100%

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:84%
cause chromosome mutation,
which almost always causes

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:90%
cell suicide.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And for the ones that have
an inactivated suicide

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.827 align:middle line:84%
mechanism, then we think maybe
there's some disease going on.

00:13:52.827 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So they're designed
to shut themselves down

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:90%
if they're not functional--

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: Oh yeah, it's
the prime directive.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:90%
This love killing themselves.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Even that can
be interfered with.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:84%
They love killing themselves,
which brings us back to Shiva

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:90%
or apoptosis cell death.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So there are a couple
of very clever ways

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to reactivate the
system of cell suicide,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and that we're broadly
calling senolysis or killing

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
of old cells, and that
can be also triggered.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's not necessarily
time, but it's aging.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:84%
We can prematurely age ourselves
due to lifestyle and choices

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:90%
that we make--

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I know in your book
you speak about that,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and so I look forward
to getting into that.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at this
other comparison.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain here how
the shorter telomeres

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
chromosomal abnormalities?

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Can you just kind of
give us a tour of that?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yes, uh huh.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:10%
So on the left we see 23
pairs of human chromosomes

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:10%
corresponding to
brightly-lit tips.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:10%
Everything is copacetic.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:10%
On the right, as I alluded to,
if you look at a cancer cell,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:10%
they're almost always
like that on the right.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:10%
We have chromosomes without
any telomere on the tip,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:10%
we have mutant
double chromosomes,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:10%
chopped up chromosomes.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:10%
This is the final common
pathway of a cell that's

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:10%
replicating, shortening
its telomeres,

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:10%
and getting these
chromosome mutations.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So Dr. Park, what is your
theory on reversing this aging

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.525 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:15:20.525 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: Well, I think it's
going to be a little time,

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
but we need to have some people
working the areas of stem cell

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:90%
storage, archiving.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
How to signal--
signaling meaning the way

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that cells tell other cells to
get younger or shape up or fix

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:90%
themselves or kill themselves.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And we need to work
on finding and killing

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:90%
dysfunctional cells.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's those three
gods we need to work at.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.455 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And what is your take on
the conditions like progeria?

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: Well, that's
why I always go back

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
to that, because everyone has
their pet theory of aging,

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
oxidation, or
lifestyle, but we have

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:84%
a model in which if
you have a 50% gene

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
dose of any of the components
that lengthen telomeres,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die at age 15.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that tells us this
is one way to get old.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:90%
So progeria is just--

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
teaches us that
accelerated telomere loss

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
is one way to get old, but
I'm sure there's other ways.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
If you irradiate
your bone marrow

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and you kill all
your stem cells,

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get old, too.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look at it in a
five-dimensional way, you know?

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's really birth, maintenance,
destruction, time, and entropy.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And as we get older, the
entropy is so apparent.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.450 align:middle line:84%
We get autoimmune
diseases, we get cancer,

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:90%
because we're no longer--

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:84%
even our cells are
not communicating

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:90%
in an efficient way.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
They're not speaking
the same language,

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and they start to
attack each other.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:90%
So entropy is a big issue also.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming chimeras
unto ourselves,

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
we're becoming what
we call mosaics.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So the ability for
ourselves to even function

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:84%
is deteriorated by the fact
that they're drifting off

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:90%
into many different directions.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you break
this down a little

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
bit for entropy for
our viewers, and just

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:84%
explain what this
process is and how

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
it affects our human
system and our ability

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:90%
to maintain health and vitality?

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: So entropy is a
concept from physics.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
It just means that there's
a tendency towards disorder

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.380 align:middle line:90%
in the system.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to take a photocopy
and photocopy it, and then

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
photocopy the
photocopy, you know

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:84%
what's going to
happen over 100 times,

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
smeared, blurred, it's

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:90%
going to look bad.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: More dispersed
kind of energy.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: So it's amazing that we
have such high replication,

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:84%
we have such lossless
replication of our chromosomes

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:90%
through life.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean on average,
there's only one error

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
in like 8 billion codes of
our DNA, one error per three

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.135 align:middle line:84%
divisions because the
correction is so good.

00:18:00.135 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
starting to realize

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:84%
that the software, which
is which genes are turned

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
on and off, that is not
as good, and it's probably

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:90%
greater than 90% efficient.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So again, we see like a 95%
correlation between gene

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.190 align:middle line:84%
silencing or methylation
and getting old.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And I know you have
some practices that people

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:84%
can do to shift from this
epigenetic standpoint,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:84%
what the outcome
is in their life

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
to hold themselves together
in this more vital sense.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've had a
longstanding now interest

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:90%
in telomeres and telomerase.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about
your personal experience

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:90%
with telomerase?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So I started taking this
supplement 12 years ago,

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.302 align:middle line:84%
and it made me lose a bunch of
weight, and my patients said,

00:18:43.302 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:90%
why do you look so different?

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And that started the
whole journey again

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.288 align:middle line:90%
with providing this to people.

00:18:48.288 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So I've learned over the
years that it can slow--

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, reverse
some of the signs of aging.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember, I gave
it 112-year-old lady,

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and she grew many, many black
hairs, which was astonishing.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And people always loved
the black hair story,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I get that all the time.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
But I think it represents
something much more deep, which

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:84%
is that unlike you know
giving up on the old person

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and buffing the chart, that
even in a 112-year-old woman,

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.630 align:middle line:90%
something can come back.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And if that's
happening in her hair,

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's
happening elsewhere.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Elsewhere in her body.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:84%
What else can people do to
activate their own telomerase?

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:90%
And is it lifestyle, is it--

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I know that you speak
about six different--

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
six different or so facets
of approach from the foods

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.497 align:middle line:84%
we eat and drink and
how we exercise and rest

00:19:36.497 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and how we breathe and
what we think about--

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:90%
and the supplementation, yeah.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak into that for us?

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Sure.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I basically wrote this book,
"The Telomere Miracle,"

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Hay House asked me
to write about it,

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and it took me in a
direction of understanding

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:90%
how people get old.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.732 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at
those six areas.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Breathing, which we started--

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I know you talk a lot about
breathing and getting centered.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.952 align:middle line:84%
And that led to the
second most important--

00:19:57.952 --> 00:19:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are in
order of importance.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Breathing is the most important
thing we do to keep alive.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are studies showing
that bad breathing causes

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:90%
disease, obviously.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So my hypothesis is that
the second area, mindset,

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
which is how we sort of organize
this symphony of our energy

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and the way we
approach life and--

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that your mindset also can
be a help or a hindrance.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And we look yet the
science in terms

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
of telomerase and telomeres,
people who meditate,

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:90%
longer telomeres.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:84%
People who stress out over
caring for a sick child,

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:90%
shorter telomeres.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So along the way, I
explain the science,

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:84%
but more importantly,
the physiology.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we tackle
sleep, which is very

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.592 align:middle line:90%
important for staying young.

00:20:42.592 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's so important for
preventing Alzheimer's.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we tackle exercise,
diet, and supplements as well.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So I really view it
from a beginner mindset.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I just say, here's what you need
to know about your physiology,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
figure out what
works for you, and I

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
think that helps immunize
people against experts.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Because as we all know
from social media,

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
one day eggs are good,
one day eggs are bad.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
One day Romaine gives us
E. Coli, the next day,

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:90%
avocados give us listeria.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of fear out there,

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.215 align:middle line:84%
and that people can live
in balance in moderation

00:21:17.215 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
just by understanding
their physiology.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: When we pull that
balance in moderation

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:84%
back together again, we have
this harmonious environment

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.745 align:middle line:84%
within our own system that
allows energy to flow,

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
it allows the communication
system and epigenetics

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and the signaling to this right
down to this stem cell level

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:90%
to be in its perfection.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I love what you're doing
to pull our attention into all

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
of these facets of life
together at the same time.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.863 align:middle line:84%
It is oftentimes that
people try one thing

00:21:47.863 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and then they try another
and then they try another,

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:84%
but if they are not trying
all of the right things

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.058 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, they
might not have the outcome

00:21:55.058 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:90%
that they're looking for.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe for
us what telo-mirror is?

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: Oh, that's just a
cute little turn of phrase

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.645 align:middle line:84%
that my then 12-year-old
son came up with.

00:22:04.645 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Cause it sounds like telomere,
so he said, oh, you're

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.320 align:middle line:90%
giving them a telo mirror.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a way
of reminding you

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:84%
that the endgame is not having
good telomeres, who cares?

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:84%
It's about the telomeres erode,
cause disease, cause imbalance

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:90%
because of what you're doing.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So the focus is
always back on you.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Are you breathing right?

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Is your posture good?

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Are you sleeping well?

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Are you eating well?

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:84%
There's many ways to stay in
balance and healthy, which

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is why the work
that you're doing

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
is so important, because
you talk about the CNS being

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:90%
the nervous system.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And if our CNS is
out of balance,

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:84%
we get autoimmune
diseases, but people

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
have sort of scratched the
surface of cranial sacral

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.707 align:middle line:84%
or meditation, but really, there
is a higher level of-- which I

00:22:47.707 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
don't really understand
or even try to understand,

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84%
but the story we
tell, it creates

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
a reality in which we live, and
that's kind of like the captain

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:90%
the ship.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:90%
That's sort of--

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So I love what you
said about you're not

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:84%
trying to go to a
higher vibration,

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.115 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to just take
it all in and breathe--

00:23:05.115 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --all of them.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Right.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: Because that's really
the kind of the turning

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:84%
point in the book
when I realized

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
that all the bad
stuff that you think

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:84%
is bad stuff, all the demons
that they might be angels,

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:90%
you really have to be grateful.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you wanted it
or you would have chosen that,

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:84%
but in order to be not locked
in fear and dysfunctional,

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:84%
you have to embrace what's
going on in your life,

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.425 align:middle line:90%
and that's really hard to do.

00:23:30.425 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: And I think your tricks
about-- well not tricks,

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:84%
but your techniques of creating
the circular breathing,

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.627 align:middle line:84%
it's true, because
when we sleep,

00:23:38.627 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:90%
we're breathing naturally.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
We're not breathing in
our chest or our neck.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: And so much of our
life going back to breathing,

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:84%
we're in the state
of anxiety, we're

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:84%
in this anxiety
state, the story.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
We wake up in the software
boots and we tell ourselves

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:90%
who we are.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a lot
we can do to just live more

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:84%
presently and live better,
and as a downstream effect,

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:84%
it'll cause our energy
and our nervous system

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.437 align:middle line:84%
and our bodies and our
cells to be more balanced.

00:24:06.437 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Just to be present.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.312 align:middle line:84%
When we can just be
present with everything

00:24:09.312 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:90%
that's happening in life,

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Right.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --we are able to be
in this cycle of create,

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:84%
sustain, let go of what we don't
need anymore, and cycle again.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's constantly reproducing--

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: We have the ideas that
we are born with, we maintain,

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we have
to kill those ideas,

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's a hard
for a lot of people.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
To let go of the
assumptions and beliefs.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the perception
and belief that health

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
is on the outside of
us, and that we need--

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:84%
we need something outside
of us to make us whole.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
What you're saying is, as
I say, that it's important

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
that we return to
recognizing that we

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:84%
are the writer of the story
that is the master of the ship.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Correct.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so I remember
you spoke about your father

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
passing, and when my mother
passed, I remember waking up,

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and just as my
eyes were opening,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I would go from this relaxed
state to this contracted state.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I remembered,
oh, my mother

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
passed just yesterday, I just
lost my mother yesterday,

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and this physiological
change would

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.870 align:middle line:84%
happen the moment that I
plugged in to a certain set

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:90%
of circuits.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Right.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And over time,
that set of circuitry

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.063 align:middle line:84%
would have an effect
on this very thing

00:25:16.063 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that we're speaking about,
telomeres and telomerase.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Right.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.472 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: It's hard to get
out of the victim's story,

00:25:21.472 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and we love telling
it, but I sort of

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
reach an epiphany writing
that book on mindset,

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:84%
because I realized that just
like in "Lord of the Rings,"

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
you have this little
fellow Gollum,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
he's like this
degenerate hobbit.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So all our lives we had
these things running

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
our show, these little
demons, and demon's

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
a computer science term, also,
they're little subprograms.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have these people
that to invite in.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that our ego,
our personality that you talk

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:84%
about, is all these little
demons running the show for us,

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're there because
we invited them in.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So the key is to make
friends with them

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.277 align:middle line:84%
and realize what
they are and what

00:25:56.277 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:84%
function they serve, where they
come from, and then move on.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They usually stay as permanent
houseguests, but it's OK,

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.745 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:26:02.745 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:10%
But I actually came
with a whole theory

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:09.020 align:middle line:10%
of like consciousness, which is
that human consciousness is not

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:10%
just facts--

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember the length
of that court or the color

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:10%
because it's not
important, it all

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:10%
has to do with
emotional metatagging.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:10%
So everything we do comes in
with an emotion, if you will,

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:10%
that's broadly defined
and a strength.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you burned yourself
when you were six,

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:90%
you never forget that.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And just like Maya
Angelou says, people never

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:84%
forget how you
made them feel, so

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:84%
much of what we're doing
to optimize our creator

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want to
call it, our best life

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:84%
is to be present
with our emotions

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and master them with that
trick of gratitude, you know?

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:84%
In that place of gratitude
and appreciation, when

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:84%
we're not afraid and we're
just operating as creator

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and allowing life to sustain
us, and we're easily letting

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:84%
go of that which is
no longer serving us,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're talking
about in this cycle,

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
how does that specifically
translate to the length

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.683 align:middle line:90%
of someone's telomeres?

00:27:09.683 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: I mean, it's a great--

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:90%
I-- that's a great question.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.080 align:middle line:84%
They did this study
of meditators in Spain

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and they found that people who
did transcendental meditation

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:90%
had longer telomeres.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I love the
science, but then

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
again, you have to take
it with a grain of salt.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
it's pointing to is

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:84%
that people who don't breathe
right, who don't sleep enough,

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:84%
who don't think
good thoughts are

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.310 align:middle line:84%
going to get old
and sick faster,

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and we know that to be true.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the mechanism,
perhaps one of the mechanisms

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.060 align:middle line:84%
is telomerase through the
endocannabinoid system, which

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.772 align:middle line:84%
is the whole other thing that
I know people in Colorado

00:27:44.772 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:84%
are discovering, but the
endocannabinoid system

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And the relationship with
that and telomere lengthening

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:84%
or less shortening associated
with the cannabinoid system,

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.172 align:middle line:84%
do you have any
experience with that?

00:27:59.172 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Well, it's interesting.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.922 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the mechanism
of the thing I've been taking,

00:28:02.922 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:84%
it appears not to be a direct
telomerase gene enhancer,

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
but it appears to trigger
something that's associated

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:90%
with and the endocannabinoids.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So when your cells are happy,
either from an artificial

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
or from a normal endogenous
thing, they're coming along

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:90%
they're in harmony.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:90%
So again, as above, so below.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.490 align:middle line:84%
When your cells are
happy, they're signaling,

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.323 align:middle line:84%
and they're just doing
what they need to do.

00:28:26.323 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's the basis of
adaptogenic herbs, if you will.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Adaptogenic is an
idea from Ayurveda

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and from other traditions
which if I take something

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and it makes me sleepy and
it makes you less sleepy,

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:90%
that's not a pharma--

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:90%
that's not a drug.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:84%
If we both take Benadryl,
we'll both get sleepy,

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
but adaptogen is something
that works upstream, perhaps

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.298 align:middle line:84%
through cell signaling
or endocannabinoid,

00:28:50.298 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:84%
so it has sort of like
an entourage effect,

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:55.295 align:middle line:84%
it kind of says,
hey, cells, be happy.

00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can get that through
listening to great music

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:84%
or breathing or taking
medical marijuana,

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.590 align:middle line:84%
but that's one of the master
conductors or regulators

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.523 align:middle line:90%
of our cell behavior.

00:29:06.523 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Let's talk
about your book.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Sure.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: There are
many wonderful things

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:15.260 align:middle line:84%
in your book about how people
can take charge, how people can

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:84%
engage in the shifting
of their own health,

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:90%
picturing their own outcomes.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.455 align:middle line:84%
What do you love
most about your book?

00:29:24.455 --> 00:29:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: I mean, I-- the
thing I like most about

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.705 align:middle line:84%
is that I didn't
really write it.

00:29:27.705 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I just sat down, and whatever
came through me came through.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I have some
knowledge of basic physiology,

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:90%
but new ideas came through.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And like the idea
of all conscious

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:41.690 align:middle line:84%
being emotionally metatagged,
that didn't come from me.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.540 align:middle line:84%
The idea of breathing
and posture,

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that was going
to be an important part.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So my whole goal was
to explain to people

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.322 align:middle line:90%
how their bodies work.

00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:10%
So it's just-- I think
I'm very proud that it's

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.010 align:middle line:10%
a handbook for being
human, because nobody ever

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.490 align:middle line:10%
teaches a kid why they sleep
or what the structure is

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:10%
or how to optimize it.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't teach you about
diet or the glycemic index

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.905 align:middle line:90%
or why people get fat.

00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Like just the most
basic rules of--

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that we know through science
now, unlike thousands of years,

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.440 align:middle line:90%
we know how these things work.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's really my gift to
try and explain to people

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.590 align:middle line:84%
how their bodies work so
they can kind of ignore some

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
of the noise from
all the experts that

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.310 align:middle line:90%
are selling and contradicting.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: There is a lot of noise.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of input.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
suggestions, and like you

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:84%
were saying earlier,
don't eat this,

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and the next week, it's
eat all of this you can.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a new invention,

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's consuming
that, and six months later

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.820 align:middle line:84%
we realize, oh, shouldn't
have been doing that at all.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So what is it in your book
that will allow people

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.590 align:middle line:84%
to sift through that and
recognize that there's

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:84%
something clear
and grounded here

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that is different
from other things

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:90%
that they might have engaged in?

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: Well, it sort of returns
back to that gift that I got

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
as-- the first night on-call as
a med student, is to realize--

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.983 align:middle line:90%
to transcend the game, right?

00:30:55.983 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:84%
You talk about the
fear narrative.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, all these people who are
gurus are selling a narrative.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, eat omega this
or don't do that.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of like in
that whole cycle of fear

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and doing the right
and the wrong.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.322 align:middle line:84%
So my whole goal
was to say, listen,

00:31:11.322 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
is right or wrong,

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:84%
but figure out how it works
and then be your best friend,

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.670 align:middle line:90%
be your own guru.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's my goal,
is that people

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
need to understand the
body's constantly in balance,

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
it's trying with all these six
cylinders to keep you healthy.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to try, you
just have to not screw it up.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We're designed to be
healthy and whole and thriving.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Right.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And we've
certainly been trained

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:90%
to believe other than that.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:39.410 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:40.743 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Because it's a dependency.

00:31:40.743 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Like doctors, experts,
the government,

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:84%
ever wants you
dependent and fearful,

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.080 align:middle line:84%
but what if people
could just figure out,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.190 align:middle line:84%
hey, it's OK if I
have a slice of pizza

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.232 align:middle line:90%
if it makes me feel good.

00:31:51.232 --> 00:31:53.273 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's where you
get these crazy stories,

00:31:53.273 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:84%
they say one day, well
wine makes you live longer

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.270 align:middle line:90%
or wine is a poison.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.152 align:middle line:90%
It can be both.

00:31:58.152 --> 00:31:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're
chugging a bottle

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.850 align:middle line:84%
by yourself out of
depression, it's probably bad.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you're having a
nice relaxing glass of vino

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and your partner is giving
your neck rub, maybe it's good,

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:90%
so they can be both.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But everything in moderation,
everything in balance.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.213 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:14.213 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:84%
That's where
wholeness stems from,

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and it is wonderful to
see us coming together

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.190 align:middle line:84%
in all these disciplines that
are starting to understand

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that all
things in moderation,

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and that it's designed
to work in our favor.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:29.820 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.637 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what is the very
best message about your book?

00:32:32.637 --> 00:32:33.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you love the most?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Don't trust experts.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.530 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So as an expert,
I'm saying, don't trust me,

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:90%
so it's kind of like that irony.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't-- trust yourself.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Well the expert has
become more and more educated

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.620 align:middle line:90%
about fewer and fewer things.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: That's right.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: They become more detailed
on less of the whole picture.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
now realizing is

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that we have to take
all of those discoveries

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:84%
from the expertise
and wrap it back

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:84%
around into this holistic
cycling that is meant to be,

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that is intended to be
whole in and of itself--

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Right.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to be the
captain of your own ship,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.050 align:middle line:84%
You can't trust your
doctor or the experts

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.020 align:middle line:84%
or the latest
social media posts,

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
you have to just trust
that your body's trying,

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and there are ways
to optimize that.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What's your greatest
insight from your last book

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.773 align:middle line:90%
till now?

00:33:21.773 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:10%
>>ED: I would just say going
from that one dimension

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:10%
to the five dimensions and
even beyond, I realized that--

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:10%
I thought, oh, eureka, I'd
seized upon the one reason--

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:10%
I still believe that it's
the prime driver of disease

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:10%
and aging, but that doesn't mean
that the other aspects aren't

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:10%
important.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to
realize that everyone

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:90%
has a piece of the puzzle.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So the way forward in terms
of curing and mitigating aging

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:84%
will be to enhance cell
death where it's appropriate,

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:54.940 align:middle line:84%
to figure out error
correction to maybe to bank

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.750 align:middle line:84%
stem cells, and even things
like exosomes, which are--

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.258 align:middle line:84%
stem cell signaling,
that's important.

00:34:02.258 --> 00:34:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Could you say more about
the exosomes and those little

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:90%
packages that they've become--

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:90%
we've spoken of.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Sure, sure.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.895 align:middle line:84%
About-- when I started
this for the telomeres,

00:34:11.895 --> 00:34:13.520 align:middle line:84%
people didn't even
know about exosomes.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle line:84%
So in the last 12
years, what people

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.170 align:middle line:90%
thought was the junk, right?

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Just the fluid, the
serum, the broth,

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.949 align:middle line:84%
they realized that floating
in that junk wasn't just loose

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:27.840 align:middle line:84%
proteins and detritus, but the
little spherical, virus-sized--

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.139 align:middle line:84%
smaller than bacteria--
those spheroid

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:84%
packages of cell signals,
mRNA proteins blocking mRNA.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:84%
And so the way that
cells talk to each other,

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:44.580 align:middle line:84%
they don't just randomly
pump out proteins,

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.429 align:middle line:84%
they actually send out
little gift baskets,

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:47.427 align:middle line:90%
these little spheres.

00:34:47.427 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:84%
So the exciting thing is,
we've known for a while

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:84%
that a platelet-rich transfusion
into the knee or young blood

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.160 align:middle line:84%
or sewing an old animal to a
young animal, all these things

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.017 align:middle line:84%
cause rejuvenation, and
we just didn't know how.

00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:03.975 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out, it's
not because of the cells,

00:35:03.975 --> 00:35:08.130 align:middle line:84%
it's because of these little
signals in these little gift

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.630 align:middle line:90%
baskets called exosomes.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's a byproduct
of cell function.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: It appears to be
the predominant form

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.630 align:middle line:84%
of cell-to-cell communication,
which we totally ignored,

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and people used to
throw out the stuff

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that the stem cells
were bathing in.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.140 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that's
the good stuff.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So-- like we're
discovering that bone broth has

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:84%
value, that there is
mineral-rich, nutrient-rich

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.790 align:middle line:84%
actually substance there that
needs to be being utilized,

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.820 align:middle line:90%
which we used to just pitch.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Yeah.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the best analogy I
can use is like music, right?

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.880 align:middle line:90%
If I play an F sharp, right?

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.680 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
anything to you--

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:90%
in what context?

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So these stem cells
are musicians,

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.360 align:middle line:84%
they play music according
to their mission

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and according to what
requests they get.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole class of stem
cells called mesenchymal stem

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
cells that we talked about
earlier deplete through life,

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:84%
but when you get sick or
injured in a young person,

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.520 align:middle line:90%
like if you do--

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:84%
if you cut a fetus's
chest open, it

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.530 align:middle line:84%
will heal without
a scar on its chest

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:84%
because the healing is so
efficient, it's regenerative.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:84%
So we heal poorly
as we age because we

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:84%
have fewer mesenchymal stem
cells with more errors,

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and they put out weaker
and less potent exosomes.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: When we are in this
state of really owning

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:84%
our own health, our
ability to heal ourselves,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
there's a form of artistry
that has to start expressing,

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:84%
an ownership of who we are
at this deep cellular level,

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness seated at
the tiniest place in our being.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to ask you, what
role do you feel energetics--

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:84%
this is near and
dear to my heart--

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.220 align:middle line:84%
the bio-energetics,
the consciousness,

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the
cosmos, and the fact

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that we are energy beings,
what is the combination here?

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.250 align:middle line:84%
What is the role of
consciousness and energy

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:05.730 align:middle line:84%
in being able to manage
our own true perfecting

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.600 align:middle line:90%
at the level of the chromosome?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: Yeah, I mean,
it's a great question,

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.690 align:middle line:84%
but the beautiful thing,
to answer your question,

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
is we don't have to
be in charge, right?

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.290 align:middle line:84%
We have these wonderful
processes of physiology.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything is conspiring
with us to be healthy.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think the main things
that people do to sabotage

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:84%
are they getting
these victims stories,

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.960 align:middle line:84%
they get into their fear,
their root chakra is activated.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And we live so much in fear
of poverty, of embarrassment,

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.720 align:middle line:90%
of danger.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
the biggest saboteur.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your
question, I think--

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I agree, it's all
energy, and that starting

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to understand gratitude,
presence, grounding,

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and just be accepting--
being accepting is important,

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:84%
because all the rest of it
will take care of itself.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.280 align:middle line:84%
You stand up there and
you wave the baton,

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.780 align:middle line:84%
but you're not the one
creating the music.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Your body is ready to
harmonize and work,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:84%
but oftentimes the guy
at the conductor podium

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:84%
is like, I had the worst
day, the traffic on the 405

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.270 align:middle line:90%
was the worst, you know?

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
there's so much that we

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:21.830 align:middle line:84%
do from moment to moment to
not be present and relaxed,

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and if we could just see
ourselves from outside

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and just accept more, everything
would go a lot better.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do you feel that the body
is a feedback mechanism for us

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.460 align:middle line:84%
awakening to our empowerment
and the truth of who

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:84%
we are and our fullness
in our wholeness?

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:84%
What role in your
world does the body

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.800 align:middle line:84%
play in that as a
feedback mechanism?

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: I do sense
that we are just here

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:53.540 align:middle line:84%
as a manifestation of whatever
the universe wants to create,

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have that much
control, but we are in charge.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if the
body's here for any purpose.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were to
ask a objective person,

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.710 align:middle line:90%
what is the purpose of humans?

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.902 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, they make
CO2 and a bunch of poop.

00:39:10.902 --> 00:39:12.152 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: [LAUGHS]

00:39:12.152 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ED: And then you
look at somebody

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.420 align:middle line:84%
like Beethoven or
Tchaikovsky or Van Gogh,

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:84%
you say, it's more
than just CO2 and poop.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a lot more going

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:84%
on in terms of why
we're here, but that's

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
way above my pay
grade, you know?

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The frontier
of creativity.

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of creativity, what
are you excited about right now?

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.237 align:middle line:84%
What is it that is
igniting you at this time.

00:39:35.237 --> 00:39:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: I'm really excited--

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I've started to-- I injected
myself, I was telling you--

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:90%
and my mom.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.590 align:middle line:10%
So we're the guinea pigs 1
and 2 with these exosomes,

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.772 align:middle line:10%
and so far we're seeing
some interesting changes.

00:39:46.772 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So if what the
other clinicians are

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.900 align:middle line:84%
saying in terms of bad joints
and chronic disease and even

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.860 align:middle line:84%
neurodegenerative
diseases, if that pans out,

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.950 align:middle line:84%
then I'm excited by offering
that to more people.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's really where the
rubber meets the road for me.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:90%
I hate sick people.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't hate them,
but I don't like it--

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I take it personally
when people get ill.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And so if I can do something to
actually impact people and make

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.870 align:middle line:84%
them well, so much the better,
I won't be just buffing

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.270 align:middle line:90%
their charts, as it were.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Absolutely.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that it's
been wonderful looking

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:22.850 align:middle line:84%
into your book and recognizing
the many ways that you're

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.540 align:middle line:84%
approaching not only these
concepts, the big picture

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:84%
of what it's all about, but
giving people real how-tos.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:90%
So I think that is--

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.590 align:middle line:90%
it's not enough to know.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.060 align:middle line:90%
People want to know how.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:84%
How do I engage,
how do I benefit,

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:41.060 align:middle line:84%
how do I begin to live from this
place that you're speaking of?

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that in
your "Telomere Miracle,"

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.380 align:middle line:84%
you have done a
beautiful job of that

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
by addressing your
multi-dimensional approach.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
It allows people to
realize that how they sleep

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and how they rest and how
they eat and how they exercise

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.788 align:middle line:84%
and how they breathe and what
kind of foods and supplements

00:41:00.788 --> 00:41:02.288 align:middle line:84%
that they're putting
into their body

00:41:02.288 --> 00:41:04.360 align:middle line:84%
is making a tremendous
difference in creating

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.465 align:middle line:84%
the environment where
wholeness can prevail,

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:84%
so I thank you for
that beautiful work.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.640 align:middle line:84%
If someone wanted to learn
more about how to reach you,

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.572 align:middle line:84%
how to connect with more
of what you have to offer,

00:41:15.572 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:84%
how would they go
about doing that?

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Sure.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.090 align:middle line:10%
I have a website called
rechargebiomedical.com,

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:24.880 align:middle line:10%
and there I offer
a lot of blogs--

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.910 align:middle line:10%
I blog weekly, talk about
different health issues

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:28.990 align:middle line:10%
and longevity.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think starting with
"The Telomere Miracle," that's

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.665 align:middle line:90%
really the best way to go.

00:41:32.665 --> 00:41:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's really what
I hope to give people,

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.280 align:middle line:90%
is this empowerment.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know about my
story and my original sort

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.160 align:middle line:84%
of one-dimensional theory
of aging based on telomeres,

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:84%
then pick up the other
book that I self-published

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:90%
called "Telomere Timebombs."

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I see that you are
pursuing your goal,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.300 align:middle line:84%
you're doing an
amazing job doing

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:56.780 align:middle line:84%
it to transform how we
approach the idea of aging,

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.080 align:middle line:84%
the belief systems that
we've been locked into,

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.200 align:middle line:84%
changing that in a very tangible
and scientifically-based

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.000 align:middle line:90%
manner.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So I so appreciate what
you're doing for humanity.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It is time for more
of this to be known.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ED: Thank you so much.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We're not doomed to
suffer as we get older.

Dr. Park's work in telomerase
activation and longevity

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
is just the beginning
of an exciting future

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.520 align:middle line:90%
in science and in health care.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.160 align:middle line:10%
Till then, we can follow
these scientific secrets

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.650 align:middle line:10%
to fight disease, feel
great, and turn back

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.540 align:middle line:10%
the clock on aging.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter,
