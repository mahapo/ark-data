>>EDWARD GROUP: Fatigue, weight
gain, depression, constipation,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:10%
these are just a few of
the more common symptoms

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:10%
of the dysfunction
of the thyroid,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:10%
a little gland that
exerts enormous influence

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:10%
over the entire body.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Dr. David Brownstein is one
of the foremost practitioners

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
of holistic medicine
and has been

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
studying the true causes
of thyroid dysfunction

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:90%
for over two decades.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
His revolutionary
treatment plan with the use

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
of iodine supplementation
at its core

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
has saved thousands
of lives to date.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the second
in a four-part series

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Brownstein.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.248 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
here, Dr. Brownstein.

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:07.082 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID BROWNSTEIN:
Thank you for having me.

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Can you
explain to our viewers

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
exactly how the thyroid
gland functions?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN: The
thyroid gland sits

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:10%
in the lower part
of the neck, and it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.385 align:middle line:10%
weighs about 1 and 1/2 ounces.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:10%
And it produces about a
teaspoon of thyroid hormone

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:10%
for a whole year.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:10%
So that teaspoon
of thyroid hormone

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:10%
has to drive the metabolic
rate of every cell in the body,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:10%
because every cell in the
body needs and requires

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:10%
adequate amounts of thyroid
hormone to function optimally.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So little variations
in that teaspoon

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:84%
can have big
effects on the body.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
As you mentioned in
the intro, problems

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
with an underproduction
of thyroid hormone

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
can be seen as weight gain,
fatigue, hair loss, dry skin.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.532 align:middle line:84%
Heart disease is associated with
it, and many other symptoms.

00:01:47.532 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It all starts in the brain,
where the pituitary gland

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:90%
produces a hormone called TSH.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%
TSH is Thyroid
Stimulating Hormone.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.892 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from
the brain and comes

00:01:56.892 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to the thyroid
gland and stimulates

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
the thyroid gland to
produce thyroid hormone.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So from the thyroid
gland, it releases

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:84%
T4, which is
Thyroglobulin molecule

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
with 4 atoms of iodine attached
to it into the bloodstream.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:84%
T4 gets circulated into the
bloodstream, hits the organs

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and goes into the
cells of every cell

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:84%
in the body, where it's
converted into T3, which has

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:90%
3 iodine atoms attached to it.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And T3 is what
binds to the thyroid

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
receptors inside the cells
and exerts the thyroid hormone

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:90%
effect that we want.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So one of the effects when
T3 binds to the cells is it

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.905 align:middle line:84%
increases the metabolic
rate, so it produces heat.

00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So people who don't
have enough thyroid

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
hormone, one of their complaints
is they're cold all the time.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.552 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're cold
because they don't

00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
have enough T3 producing
an increased metabolic rate

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and producing heat.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:90%
So the system works pretty well.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
We were designed well to have
adequate thyroid function

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:84%
if the body has
an adequate source

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
of iodine and other nutrients
to help the thyroid work better.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how common is it
these days to see individuals

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.998 align:middle line:90%
with thyroid disorders?

00:02:59.998 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: How common is it?

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It's really common.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the most
common reason people go

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:90%
to their primary care doctor.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest complaint
I hear from my patients

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:90%
is they're fatigued.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
thyroid effects when

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
it binds to those receptors
is it produces enough energy

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.812 align:middle line:90%
to keep us from being fatigued.

00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So fatigue should
be a first signal

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps the thyroid
is not working correctly.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.128 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What are the different
types of thyroid disorders

00:03:26.128 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that are out there right now?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.318 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, I
mean, the most common one

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:31.620 align:middle line:84%
is hypothyroidism, or
an underactive thyroid.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:84%
That's where people are
producing underactive amounts

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:90%
of T4 and T3.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And they exhibit the
signs of hypothyroidism.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They're tired,
they're cold, they're

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:90%
gaining weight, hair loss.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:84%
They can become a
little swollen, fluid

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:90%
under their skin.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of the coin
is hyperthyroidism, where they

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:90%
produce too much T4 and T3.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
These people are nervous,
jittery, they're losing weight.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:90%
They can get palpitations.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
autoimmune thyroid diseases.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Hashimoto's disease and Graves'
disease lead the way with that.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Those conditions can be
either hyper or hypo,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:84%
in the case of
Hashimoto's disease.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So I'm assuming
that some of those

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:90%
can lead to thyroid cancer.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Would it be the same
symptoms that someone

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
would be suffering from
with any of those conditions

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.973 align:middle line:84%
as it would be if someone was
suffering from thyroid cancer?

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
thyroid cancer

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
is the fastest-growing cancer
in the United States right now,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
so it's affecting
a lot of people.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And the main reason we're seeing
such a rapid rise of thyroid

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:90%
cancer is the lack of iodine.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.475 align:middle line:10%
And the iodine is
an essential item

00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:10%
for every cell in the body.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.722 align:middle line:10%
We can't live without it.

00:04:40.722 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:10%
But it's really essential
for thyroid gland function.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
We can't make thyroid
hormone without iodine.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Now iodine also concentrates in
the other glands of the body.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:84%
That includes the thyroid, the
ovaries, the uterus, pituitary,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:90%
pancreas, and prostate gland.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can't make any
hormone without iodine.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going to focus
on the thyroid, recall

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that I said to you, T4 has four
atoms of iodine attached to it.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
T3 has three atoms of iodine
attached to the thyroglobulin

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:90%
molecule.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
We can't make those
T4 and T3 molecules

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
without adequate amounts of
iodine in the thyroid gland.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
My research has clearly shown
that iodine levels have fallen

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:90%
over the last 40 to 50 years.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they've fallen over
50% across the United States.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.678 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're seeing such an
epidemic of thyroid problems.

00:05:25.678 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: The medical
profession uses

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
the term "chronic
illnesses" all the time.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I just-- [CHUCKLES]
it's bizarre to me,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think you should
ever have a chronic illness.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
That's just an illness
for life, basically.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've talked about
how important the thyroid is,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and how all of these other
illnesses, especially heart

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
disease and many other
illnesses have a link

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:84%
to iodine deficiency, or even
have a link to the thyroid,

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:90%
especially heart disease.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you expand on thyroid
and heart disease and maybe

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:90%
some other chronic illnesses?

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Sure.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So the relationship between
low thyroid and heart disease

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
was written about
in the late 1800s.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's been known
for over 100 years.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Now in medical school, we're not
given much information on that.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
It's touched on a little
bit, but really, the cause

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:84%
of heart disease that
medical students learn

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
is high cholesterol levels,
which I have written about.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that's the cause of it.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:84%
That's a symptom of it,
because if the thyroid is

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
underfunctioning, one of
the things that happens

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
is there's a lot of
inflammation in the body.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And the body
produces cholesterol

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:90%
as an anti-inflammatory agent.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of
hypothyroidism,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:90%
cholesterol will go up.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:90%
And it can go up significantly.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Now the treatment for that
case of high cholesterol

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.412 align:middle line:84%
isn't to give them a statin
drug or a cholesterol-lowering

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
medication, because you're just
treating the symptom, which

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:90%
is high cholesterol.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
It's treat the hypothyroidism,
and then the cholesterol

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:90%
will naturally come down.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: The autoimmune,
Graves' and Hashimoto's, can

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:84%
you let the viewers know the
difference between the two

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.902 align:middle line:90%
and maybe some symptoms of each?

00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
autoimmune disease

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:84%
is where the body
produces antibodies

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:90%
against its own cells.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.735 align:middle line:84%
Now conventional medicine
has no idea why that occurs.

00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And their treatment for
an autoimmune disease

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.045 align:middle line:84%
is basically to shut
off the immune system.

00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's just not
treating the underlying cause

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:90%
of the illness.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
That's just treating
the symptoms of it.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So in thyroid
autoimmune disease,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
the most common ones are
Hashimoto's and Graves'

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.918 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:07:22.918 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And the body is
producing antibodies,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
which it's attacking
the thyroid,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and causing inflammation
of the thyroid.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Graves'
disease, the inflammation

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
can cause an increased
release of thyroid hormone,

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and these people get nervous
and jittery and palpitations.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.373 align:middle line:84%
In the case of
Hashimoto's disease,

00:07:39.373 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
certain white blood
cells, called lymphocytes,

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:84%
attack the thyroid gland,
cause the inflammation.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can either get
hyperthyroid-- nervous,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:90%
jittery, palpitations--

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
or you can get hypothyroid,
where they're tired, fatigued,

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:90%
weight gain.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So it can go either
way with that.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But the underlying cause
of both Hashimoto's

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and Graves' disease,
in my research,

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:84%
has been clearly shown
to be iodine deficiency.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So many
people these days, you

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
ask people what
they suffer from,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and they say fatigue,
chronic fatigue.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:84%
What is the correlation between
the thyroid and something

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
like fibromyalgia,
which would be a pain

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:90%
disorder, and chronic fatigue?

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So recall that
T3 binds to the thyroid hormone

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
receptors in the cells, and it
increases the metabolic rate.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And it causes the cells
to produce ATP molecules,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:90%
or energy molecules.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have
enough thyroid hormone,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
we get depleted of
the metabolic rate,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and everything slows down.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And we get depleted
of ATP molecules.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
One of the symptoms of that
is going to be fatigue.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So fatigue should be
a red light going off

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
in a patient's head
and a doctor's head--

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.615 align:middle line:84%
perhaps this is my
thyroid causing this.

00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Now there can be other
causes of fatigue out there.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
just be hypothyroidism,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:90%
but it's a common cause of it.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it needs to be
addressed more and looked at.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of fibromyalgia,
where people are fatigued

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and they have muscle
aches and pains,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.715 align:middle line:84%
I've treated many, many
patients over the years.

00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Once you get their hormonal
system and nutritional system

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
balanced, many times the
fibromyalgia symptoms

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:90%
get markedly better.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Or in multiple
cases, they go away.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I've talked to many,
many doctors over the years,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lack of education
when it comes to the thyroid.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
a lack of education

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to iodine.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's say
somebody is suffering

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and they go into the standard
doctor, endocrinologist.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
What is the conventional
way to diagnose

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.033 align:middle line:90%
and to treat thyroid disorders?

00:09:37.033 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So when I
was in medical school,

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I was taught to
check a TSH level.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
If that TSH level fell
within the reference range,

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:84%
then you were to
tell the patient

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:84%
they don't have a
thyroid problem,

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.773 align:middle line:90%
and it was something else.

00:09:50.773 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Now the something else
usually turned into you

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.315 align:middle line:84%
were going to write
them a prescription

00:09:54.315 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
for an antidepressant
or something like that.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Now medical students are taught
to check a TSH and a T4 level.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.867 align:middle line:84%
And if those levels fall
within the reference range,

00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
they're taught that the patients
don't have a thyroid problem,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and you treat them
with something else.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Now the whole conventional
medical school curriculum

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.260 align:middle line:84%
revolves around diagnosing
pathology and prescribing

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
the one drug to
treat that pathology.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.635 align:middle line:84%
So you've just not
diagnosed a thyroid problem.

00:10:21.635 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
diagnose something else

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and give them another
drug because that's

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.435 align:middle line:84%
the whole model
we're trained in.

00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:90%
It's just prescribe drugs.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't check the
T3 levels, if you don't

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.258 align:middle line:90%
check the reverse T3 levels--

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
there are some other
thyroid levels--

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
if you don't check the
thyroid antibodies, which

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
is how a complete holistic
look at thyroid function

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
should be done, you're
going to miss this stuff.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.473 align:middle line:84%
And I did miss this stuff at
the beginning of my career,

00:10:45.473 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
when I was following my
conventional training.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
But I am much wiser
about that now.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've written
about that in my book

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and why it's so important
to check all those thyroid

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.698 align:middle line:84%
levels, because otherwise,
you're going to miss

00:10:54.698 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:90%
the diagnosis in many patients,

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How many people do
you think are just misdiagnosed?

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the doctors don't
even look at the thyroid,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.897 align:middle line:84%
or they just diagnose
them with something else

00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:90%
when it's really the thyroid?

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: It's
a huge amount.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:90%
It's sad.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.867 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's making
patients so unhappy out there,

00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and why they're searching
on the internet for help

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:90%
for their problems.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And they are being
misdiagnosed, but they're

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
being underdiagnosed
because doctors

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to properly
test for all the thyroid levels

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:90%
and how to interpret them.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you talked
about the root cause.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
What is the root cause
of most of these thyroid

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
conditions that people
are suffering from today?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, one
of the major root causes

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.110 align:middle line:90%
is iodine deficiency.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So as I said,
iodine concentrates

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.103 align:middle line:90%
in the thyroid gland.

00:11:40.103 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the highest
concentration

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:84%
of iodine in the body
occurs in the thyroid gland.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So this small
little gland weighs

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
about an ounce,
ounce and a half,

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.688 align:middle line:84%
concentrates more iodine than
any other area of the body.

00:11:50.688 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's needed to
do that because it

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.147 align:middle line:84%
needs to make thyroid
hormone, which is needed

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:90%
by every cell in the body.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: By the
way, Dr. Brownstein

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:90%
does have an incredible book.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Overcoming
Thyroid Disorders."

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It's gone through
several editions.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brownstein, this
is an incredible book.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.340 align:middle line:10%
I would recommend everybody
purchase this book.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:84%
What's changed in this
book over the years?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
it's interesting.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I only write about what
works in my practice.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So when I see the vast
majority of my people

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.658 align:middle line:84%
having thyroid
problems, and when

00:12:23.658 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
you correct those thyroid
problems and they get better,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.390 align:middle line:90%
that's why I wrote the book.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:90%
What's changed over the years?

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Nothing much-- it hasn't
changed that much.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:90%
The treatment is still the same.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But what's changed is
we've become more toxic.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:90%
So we've become higher--

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:84%
we've had higher levels of
bromine toxicity and fluoride

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:84%
toxicity, which is making
more thyroid problems.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, as iodine
levels have fallen,

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:84%
that has exacerbated
the situation.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So the only way to
correct that is following

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:84%
a holistic plan, where
you correct imbalances,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:90%
like take iodine.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
You detoxify to help
the body release

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.597 align:middle line:84%
these bromide and fluoride
atoms that are in there.

00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you support
the body nutritionally,

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:84%
with eating a good diet,
drinking enough water,

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and correcting
nutrient imbalances.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not that difficult
a program to do,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:90%
but it does work.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.497 align:middle line:84%
And it works for the
vast majority of patients

00:13:12.497 --> 00:13:15.115 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen and my
partners have seen.

00:13:15.115 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Over
the last 10 years,

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
let's say, do you think
that the iodine deficiency

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:90%
situation is improving at all?

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.938 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it's
still declining?

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: The good news
about the iodine deficiency

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.110 align:middle line:84%
problem is people are learning
about it and taking iodine.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is our toxicity
levels are still high,

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
so there's a lot of
problems out there.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But the news is out there,
and people are taking it

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:90%
into their own hands.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I would tell patients
always to try and work

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
with a doctor
knowledgeable about iodine,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.687 align:middle line:84%
but those are few
and far between.

00:13:45.687 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons
I write my books

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.812 align:middle line:84%
is to educate people
so they can made

00:13:48.812 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:90%
good choices on what to do.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So why is the RDA of
iodine 150 micrograms a day?

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: That goes
back almost 100 years

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to the early 20th century, when
the population was expanding

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
across the United States from
the East Coast to the West

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Coast.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And in the Midwest--

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Michigan, Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio--

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.248 align:middle line:90%
there was a goiter epidemic.

00:14:12.248 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And people were suffering
from large thyroids that were

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:90%
sticking out of their neck.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just
occurring in people.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.413 align:middle line:90%
It was occurring in animals.

00:14:19.413 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
The animals were
having thyroid problems

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.767 align:middle line:84%
because of a lack of iodine
in the soil and water.

00:14:23.767 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And the animals weren't
growing to the right size,

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
procreating correctly.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So the government saw this
problem, and the government,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
from the highest
levels, were worried

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that the expanding human
population across our country

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
was going to
outstrip the ability

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to supply it with enough
food and enough animals

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
to feed this population,
because the animals

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:90%
weren't growing correctly.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So the government established
a group to look at this.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And outside of Cleveland,
Ohio, they did the first study

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to look at how much iodine
you could add to animal food

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.352 align:middle line:84%
to improve the thyroid
function of animals

00:14:58.352 --> 00:15:00.060 align:middle line:84%
where they didn't have
a swollen thyroid.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and they grew to the right
size and procreated correctly.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So the minimum
amount of iodine was

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
found to animal feed that
could make their thyroid

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:90%
work normally.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they calculated
the minimum amount of iodine

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:84%
in humans so they
wouldn't get a goiter.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So the easiest way to
get iodine in humans

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
at that point was to
put iodine in salt.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So they put 150 micrograms,
which is the RDA for iodine

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:84%
in salt. And they did a
study in Michigan and Ohio

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and found the goiter
went away in those

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
that took 150 micrograms.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the
RDA was established,

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was never
changed from that.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:10%
So in conventional
medical thinking,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:10%
when the goiter went away,
all the thyroid problems

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:10%
went away with 150
micrograms of iodine.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So there was really no
need to think about iodine,

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
to investigate iodine, or to
study iodine at that point.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And from then on,
medical students

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.882 align:middle line:84%
were always taught
iodine deficiency

00:15:54.882 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:90%
is a thing of the past.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
It was rectified
with iodized salt.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
That is certainly not the
case, because I diagnose goiter

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:90%
all the time in patients.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons goiters
aren't being properly diagnosed

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is doctors have
lost their skills

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:90%
at palpating the thyroid.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Doctors have skills
with a pen and a paper,

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:84%
but they've lost
their hand skills.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know how to
properly palpate the thyroid.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I was not taught
in medical school

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
how to properly
palpate a thyroid.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I taught myself my own
technique of doing it.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And when medical
students and residents

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
rotate with me or I
lecture to doctors,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I take time and show them how
to properly feel a thyroid.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.612 align:middle line:84%
I can feel nodules down
to 0.3 millimeters.

00:16:34.612 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And the way you're taught in
medical school, the only thing

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.445 align:middle line:84%
you're going feel
in a thyroid is

00:16:38.445 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
if it's sticking out of the
neck, and it's grossly large.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if you
could adjust the RDA,

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
with all of your
research, what do you

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:84%
think is a good daily
level of iodine?

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So recall, that
has changed over the years.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Our iodine requirements
have gone up

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
compared to our
predecessors because

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
of this toxic halide
levels we're exposed to.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:10%
So my experience
has shown that it's

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:10%
going to be milligram amounts of
iodine, not microgram amounts.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:10%
So it's going to be 100 to
400 times the RDA for iodine.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.260 align:middle line:10%
Or about 12 to 25
milligrams, for most people,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:10%
is going to be the minimal
amount of iodine to allow

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:10%
the body to release
those toxic halides

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:10%
and to saturate the iodine
receptors of the body.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.655 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Do you
think everybody should

00:17:24.655 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:84%
go in and get tested for iodine
deficiency on a regular basis?

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.187 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I
think the best way

00:17:29.187 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
to do it is to work with
an iodine-literate doctor.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.318 align:middle line:10%
And do you need to be
tested on a regular basis?

00:17:35.318 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:10%
I don't think you need to be
tested on a regular basis.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to be tested before
therapy and maybe once when

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:90%
therapy starts.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Then you can use symptoms
and thyroid function

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and some other surrogate
markers and adjust the dose

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
as you need to.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Those who have glandular
problems such as thyroid,

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.078 align:middle line:84%
ovaries, uterus, breast,
prostate, pancreas,

00:17:53.078 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:84%
will need more iodine
than those that

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:90%
don't have glandular problems.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.150 align:middle line:10%
So maybe 12 to 25
milligrams, for most people,

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:10%
can be a healthy amount to
keep bromide and fluoride

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:10%
from accumulating in the
body, and trying to saturate

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:10%
the iodine receptors.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:10%
But those who have
established glandular problems

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:10%
will need more iodine.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes they need
hundreds of milligrams.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen cancers of
those tissues get better.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Now iodine is not a
standalone therapy.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
It's best used as part of a
holistic treatment regimen,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
including other hormone
balancing, nutrient balancing,

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:84%
correcting vitamin and mineral
deficiencies, detoxification,

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and a whole host of
other holistic therapies.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if somebody
is watching and says,

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to go test
my iodine levels,

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and goes to their
practitioner and says, Doc,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
could you please do
an iodine test on me?

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.455 align:middle line:90%
What test are they going to run?

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm assuming that
all these doctors are not

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the iodine
loading test, correct?

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: That's correct.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So you can do an
iodine spot urine test.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
A spot test means you
just pee in a cup,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
check the iodine levels,
and see where you're at.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:58.040 align:middle line:84%
That test only works if
someone's not taking iodine.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Once you're taking iodine,
we have no reference ranges

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.813 align:middle line:90%
for that test.

00:19:01.813 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So that leads to the
iodine loading test

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:90%
that Dr. Abraham designed.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I helped him with it, but
that really was his deal.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And the iodine loading
test is where you

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:90%
take 50 milligrams of iodine.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:84%
From that point, you
collect 24 hours of urine,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and you send in a
little sample of urine.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And we look at how much
iodine comes out in the urine.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And we know 98% to 99%
of orally ingested iodine

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:90%
will come out in the urine.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So we can simply subtract 50
milligrams minus what came out

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and realize how much
your body held on to.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Generally, if the body is
really deficient in iodine,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
it'll hold on to a lot
of that 50 milligrams.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
If the receptors are all
saturated with iodine,

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and you take 50
milligrams, you should

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.610 align:middle line:84%
hold on to about 5
milligrams, or 10% of that.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:84%
If 5 milligrams is
excreted, you should have

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.063 align:middle line:90%
enough iodine in your body.

00:19:52.063 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
When you excrete less than
that your body's hanging on to,

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.762 align:middle line:90%
you're more deficient.

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what do you think
about the blood iodine test?

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: The blood iodine
test is not a helpful test.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:84%
The reference ranges
aren't well set.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It's better to test iodine
through urinary levels.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
That's been the established
way for testing iodine

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.265 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:20:09.265 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So why are
all the endocrinologists

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and why are these
doctors not familiar

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.015 align:middle line:90%
with the iodine loading test?

00:20:15.015 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
many doctors aren't

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:90%
familiar with a lot of things.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:84%
They're not familiar with
vitamin C. They're not

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.182 align:middle line:90%
familiar with magnesium.

00:20:21.182 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not familiar with
other hormones of the body.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.905 align:middle line:84%
Because they weren't taught
that in medical school,

00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:27.978 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know about it.

00:20:27.978 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of ignorance
in medicine out there.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And I found out when I
started switching over

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
to my holistic
practice how little I

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.847 align:middle line:90%
did know about medicine.

00:20:35.847 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still learning
about medicine.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.522 align:middle line:90%
I'm still a student of it.

00:20:38.522 --> 00:20:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what would be
the conventional treatment

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.833 align:middle line:90%
for someone with hypothyroidism?

00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, the
conventional treatment

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:84%
is only instituted when that TSH
falls above a reference range.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And they will use synthetic
thyroid hormone or T4

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.470 align:middle line:90%
derivatives.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
Synthroid or Levothroid.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And they will give
enough T4 thyroid hormone

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to drop that TSH back
into the reference range

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:90%
and call it a day.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Now some people
do fine with that,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.880 align:middle line:84%
but there's more than just
T4, as we went through

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:90%
on that diagram.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:90%
T4 converts into T3.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:90%
There's a reverse T3 in there.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.262 align:middle line:84%
So my experience
has clearly shown,

00:21:16.262 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to use a
thyroid hormone for treating

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
hypothyroidism, it's much better
when T4 is combined with T3.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:84%
There are natural
desiccated thyroid hormones.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Armour Thyroid, Nature-Throid
are examples of those.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
You can even use T3
along with T4 separately.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the
psychiatric literature

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.730 align:middle line:84%
shows that improves
depression in people.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So this can be done, but
doctors aren't trained on it.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:90%
They don't know about it.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's best to work
with a holistic practitioner.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What about the
opposite, hyperthyroidism,

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.908 align:middle line:84%
what's the conventional
method to treat that?

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
for hyperthyroidism,

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.030 align:middle line:84%
they're producing too much
thyroid hormone, too much T4,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:90%
too much T3.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
The symptoms are nervous,
jittery, palpitations.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
People don't like
hyperthyroidism.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.823 align:middle line:84%
They're losing weight
when they're not

00:22:01.823 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
trying to lose weight, and
it can make people miserable.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The conventional
treatment for that

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately to use
radioactive iodine therapy,

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:84%
where you inject
radioactive iodine.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
It's taken up by
the thyroid, and it

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.640 align:middle line:84%
destroys wherever the cells
that it's taken up to.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
that therapy is, not

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.545 align:middle line:84%
only is radioactive iodine
taken up by the thyroid.

00:22:23.545 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
You're forgetting it's
taken up by the breast

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and the ovaries and the
prostate and the pancreas

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:28.848 align:middle line:90%
and the uterus.

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it
destroying tissue there,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:90%
it's altering the DNA there.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.525 align:middle line:84%
That's why studies show multiple
years after radioactive iodine

00:22:36.525 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:84%
therapy for the thyroid,
there is an increased risk

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of other cancers.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So radioactive iodine should
be used as a last resort.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
In 25 years of looking
at patients this way,

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:84%
I've not had to use
radioactive iodine in anybody.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.862 align:middle line:84%
I have sent some people
for thyroidectomies.

00:22:50.862 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:84%
That's about a patient
every two or three

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
years, who have Graves' disease,
and we can't get control of it.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And those people are rare.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I would rather people go
through a thyroidectomy

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.535 align:middle line:84%
than use radioactive iodine to
get rid of the thyroid gland.

00:23:02.535 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Dr.
Brownstein, can you

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.410 align:middle line:84%
tell us about one of your
memorable, dramatic thyroid

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:09.857 align:middle line:90%
cases that you saw?

00:23:09.857 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
Tracy's story started

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
after the birth of
one of her children,

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:84%
when her doctor picked
up she was hypothyroid

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and a TSH in the hundreds.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And she was severely
hypothyroid.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't think clearly.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.430 align:middle line:84%
She gained about 30
pounds of weight.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Her brain wasn't
working, and she

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.543 align:middle line:90%
would mix up the kids' lunches.

00:23:30.543 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
She'd go to the grocery
store, couldn't remember why

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:90%
she was in the grocery store.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
She'd be driving home
from the grocery store,

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
getting lost for
a while, until she

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:90%
remembered she was going home.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And Tracy's life became
a mess with this,

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
so her doctor treated
her with Synthroid.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:10%
And I show you the
pre picture of Tracy

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:10%
here with this high TSH.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.938 align:middle line:10%
And the doctor treated
her with Synthroid,

00:23:50.938 --> 00:23:53.230 align:middle line:10%
and I'll show you the next
picture of her on Synthroid.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:10%
And you can still see
in the second picture,

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.795 align:middle line:10%
her face was all
swollen, and she still

00:23:57.795 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:10%
was complaining her brain
wasn't working correctly.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:10%
She's mixing up
the kids' lunches,

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:10%
and she's still getting lost,
having the same symptoms.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So she went back
to her doctor here,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor said, oh,
well, your TSH is normal.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: That's a
huge difference in TSH.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is a
normal TSH level?

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
the reference range

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:84%
for TSH, thyroid
stimulating hormone,

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
comes from the pituitary
gland to stimulate the thyroid

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
to make thyroid hormone,
the reference range

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
for this hormone is about
0.5 to 4.5 in most labs.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Now the optimal TSH level
should be around 1.0,

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
but we'll talk about
that at the end of this.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So in Tracy's
case, her first TSH

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:84%
was in the 180s, fell
down to a normal--

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:90%
in the reference range.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.565 align:middle line:84%
And her doctor said, you don't
have hypothyroidism anymore.

00:24:45.565 --> 00:24:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Tracy said, what do I have?

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.273 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I think
you're depressed.

00:24:48.273 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
You should be on
an antidepressant.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Tracy said, I'm not
taking an antidepressant.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So Tracy had read my
books and came to see me.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And I did an iodine
level on her.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:90%
She was very low on iodine.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.967 align:middle line:84%
And I switched her
from the Synthroid

00:25:05.967 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:84%
that she was on from
the conventional doctor

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:90%
to natural thyroid.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And I put her on iodine
at the same time.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.151 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the
following picture of her,

00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:16.917 align:middle line:10%
her swelling is gone,
her hair looks better.

00:25:16.917 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:10%
And she felt better,
more importantly.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:10%
Her brain came back to life.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:10%
Tracy became so much
better with things.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:10%
She formed a thyroid support
group online and helps

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.920 align:middle line:10%
manage thousands of people
who have thyroid problems, who

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.260 align:middle line:10%
aren't getting help out there.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Dr. Brownstein, let's
talk about thyroid illnesses

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:90%
in children.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:90%
What's going on with that?

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
it's not just adults

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:90%
that have thyroid problems.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.667 align:middle line:84%
Kids can have thyroid
problems, and they can have it

00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:90%
for the same reason--

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
not enough iodine or a
lack of other nutrients

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:90%
that can cause it.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Or if their mom
has hypothyroidism

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:84%
when they're pregnant
with the baby,

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.622 align:middle line:84%
there's a really
good chance that kid

00:25:49.622 --> 00:25:52.375 align:middle line:84%
is going to have hypothyroidism
at some time in their life.

00:25:52.375 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Now let me give an example.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Dawson is one of my patients.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.370 align:middle line:84%
His mom had thyroid cancer,
was given three rounds

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of radioactive iodine
treatment before she

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:90%
was pregnant with him.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And she was not properly
treated with thyroid hormone

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and was not properly
normal thyroid when

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:90%
she was pregnant with Dawson.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So Dawson, in utero, was set
up to have thyroid problems.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So I was treating Dawson's
mom with thyroid hormone,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.390 align:middle line:90%
and she asked me to see Dawson.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The complaints at
that time were Dawson

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:84%
was up and down, up
and down at mealtime.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:84%
He was driving the
family crazy, and he

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:90%
was disruptive at school.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The teacher said
he was up and down.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't paying attention.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:84%
The school was
bothering Dawson's mom

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to put him on Ritalin
and ADHD medications,

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:90%
and she didn't want to do that.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So when she brought him to me,
I did my history and physical

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:90%
and checked the lab tests.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.612 align:middle line:84%
And Dawson's thyroid levels
were in the lower part

00:26:42.612 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:90%
of the reference range.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:84%
He had slow reflexes
when I checked them.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And because of
Dawson's mom's history,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I made a clinical diagnosis
of hypothyroidism with Dawson.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And I put him on a small
amount of thyroid hormone,

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and immediately he was better.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.090 align:middle line:84%
The teacher confronted
Dawson's mom

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, you must've
put him on ADHD medications.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:02.700 align:middle line:90%
He's so much better.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, we treated
his hypothyroidism.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:90%
So Dawson did well for a time.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I get a call from
Dawson's mom a year later

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:84%
saying, the thyroid
medication isn't working.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:84%
He's up and down,
up and down again,

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and the school is
complaining again.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.443 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:27:17.443 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Dawson's mom if
he was in a growth spurt,

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and she said yes,
his pants were short.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Now Stephanie, his
mom, had also told

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.450 align:middle line:84%
me Dawson had failed a spelling
test which she had worked

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:90%
with him the night before on.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her, when
kids are in a growth spurt,

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:84%
a normal child with
normal thyroid function

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:84%
will produce more
thyroid hormone

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
to support the body
during that growth spurt.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Hypothyroid patients
can't do that.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:84%
They need an adjustment
on their thyroid hormone.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So over the phone, I
told her, let's all

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.160 align:middle line:84%
go up on his natural thyroid
hormone by a quarter grain

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and see how he does.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So she called me back
a couple of days later

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and said, hey, two days
into this, he was better.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.198 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to watch
him and see how he does.

00:27:55.198 --> 00:27:57.448 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to make him
take the spelling test again

00:27:57.448 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:90%
next week.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.083 align:middle line:84%
So a week later, Dawson went to
take the spelling test again,

00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and his mom said she
did not prepare him

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.920 align:middle line:90%
for the spelling test.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the results on
the right side of the screen.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.760 align:middle line:10%
He's in the lines.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
He's got most of
the words correctly,

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:90%
no aliens to help him.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a perfect
example of your brain

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:84%
on hypothyroidism, on
the left, and your brain

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.107 align:middle line:84%
with enough thyroid
hormone on the right.

00:28:19.107 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You can see the
lack of attention on the left,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
with the aliens up
there, the scribbling.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, his mind is not
being-- he's not being mindful.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:90%
His mind is not focusing.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And then a complete
transformation

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.332 align:middle line:84%
on the right side,
that is just amazing.

00:28:33.332 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: It's not just
kids suffering from this.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It's adults too.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why doctors are busy
prescribing antidepressants

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.922 align:middle line:84%
and psychiatric
medications and stimulants

00:28:42.922 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to both adults and
kids, when they're not

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
treating the underlying
cause of these problems.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:84%
These kids and adults don't
have a stimulant deficiency

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:90%
syndrome.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:90%
They have hormonal imbalances.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:52.990 align:middle line:90%
They have nutrient imbalances.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
They have toxicities that
need to be addressed.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And this
transformation

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.170 align:middle line:90%
happened in just 11 days.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:90%
That is incredible.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Now if somebody out
there is looking

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.357 align:middle line:84%
for supplementing with
iodine, the iodine

00:29:07.357 --> 00:29:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that you use in your
practice, can you

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
give us a general overview
of the different types

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.930 align:middle line:84%
of iodine supplementations,
what they can take,

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.920 align:middle line:90%
what you recommend.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you don't want
people going to the drugstore

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and getting povidone iodine
from the shelf and drinking it,

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.632 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: First,
I would say it's

00:29:24.632 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%
best if you can work with
a holistic doctor who can

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:90%
help monitor you and guide you.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.612 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
would recommend.

00:29:30.612 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
use iodine, it's

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.590 align:middle line:84%
better to use a combination
of iodine and iodide,

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.180 align:middle line:90%
not use one form alone.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you from
personal experience

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that the combination
works better.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
to keep in mind

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.990 align:middle line:84%
that small amounts of iodine
which in previous generations

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:84%
could help people,
in this generation

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
were too toxic and too loaded
with bromide and fluoride.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough iodine
to help the body kick out

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:54.492 align:middle line:90%
those toxic things.

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need
to use milligram

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:57.600 align:middle line:90%
amounts of these things.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Average doses for
most of my patients

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.010 align:middle line:90%
are around 25 milligrams a day.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:10%
If they have glandular
problems or cancer

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.280 align:middle line:10%
or serious other
problems, I'll use more.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.075 align:middle line:10%
And it's a pretty
safe therapy for most.

00:30:12.075 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:10%
There are potential side
effects with iodine,

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:10%
like for any therapy out there.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.918 align:middle line:84%
But it's a pretty safe
therapy out there.

00:30:17.918 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Why do you think that
conventional doctors and even

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:84%
some natural health
care practitioners out

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.848 align:middle line:84%
there have that fear
of using iodine?

00:30:24.848 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, conventional
doctors don't know about it.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.108 align:middle line:90%
So they weren't taught it.

00:30:29.108 --> 00:30:30.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't know about it.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to use it.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.300 align:middle line:84%
As far as the holistic
practitioners,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.440 align:middle line:84%
the myth that iodine causes
Hashimoto's and Graves' disease

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.840 align:middle line:84%
should be dispelled by
what I said earlier,

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:90%
that iodine levels have fallen.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.340 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, Graves' and
Hashimoto's has increased.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I can't quite
explain it to you,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.030 align:middle line:84%
how when you're
presented with the data,

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.677 align:middle line:84%
that you can't see
the light there.

00:30:49.677 --> 00:30:52.260 align:middle line:84%
But some people just don't want
to allow themselves to see it.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you, in our
practice of treating thousands

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:84%
of patients, we
help people get over

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Hashimoto's and Graves' disease.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.202 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it with a
natural, holistic approach.

00:31:01.202 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what would be your
recommendation for somebody

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
who wants to go find a
holistic practitioner?

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
What do they do, the
questions they ask?

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.650 align:middle line:84%
How do they find
somebody that knows

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.120 align:middle line:84%
about iodine, that
knows about how

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.543 align:middle line:90%
to treat the thyroid properly?

00:31:13.543 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So number one,
they can look on the internet

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.147 align:middle line:90%
and try and find people.

00:31:17.147 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Number two, they can call
a compounding pharmacist

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.090 align:middle line:90%
in their area.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.590 align:middle line:84%
The compounding
pharmacists know who

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:24.270 align:middle line:84%
is prescribing natural
things for their patients.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And number three, they're going
to look at holistic societies.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the board of the
International College

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.300 align:middle line:90%
of Integrative Medicine.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.680 align:middle line:90%
It's ICIMED.org.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have a list of
doctors around the country.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
There are other groups
who do this as well.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It may be hard work
to find somebody.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
It may be a little
laborious, but in the end,

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.633 align:middle line:84%
it can be worth it if
you can find a partner

00:31:45.633 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:84%
to work with you to maintain
your optimal health.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.718 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yes, totally.

00:31:48.718 --> 00:31:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that those
individuals should recommend

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:84%
to their health
care practitioners

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.420 align:middle line:90%
to do the iodine loading test?

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I
have no problem when

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.192 align:middle line:84%
patients recommend to me to do
certain testing or therapies.

00:32:00.192 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that other doctors

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:02.858 align:middle line:90%
should have a problem either.

00:32:02.858 --> 00:32:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
should educate themselves

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and should be a part of
their health care decision.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.202 align:middle line:84%
So sure, I think they can have
a discussion with their health

00:32:09.202 --> 00:32:11.070 align:middle line:90%
care provider about that.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: When
individuals start,

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.060 align:middle line:84%
when you put
individuals on iodine,

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.850 align:middle line:84%
do they ever go through some
sort of a Herxheimer reaction

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.190 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of
a detoxification?

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So iodine
can cause the body

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.580 align:middle line:90%
to release fluoride and bromide.

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a lot
of that in your body,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:90%
you can get sick from that.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen patients
get sick from that.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the Herxheimer
reaction you're talking about.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And they can get achy
and flu-like and fatigued

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:90%
from that.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Now to minimize that,
it's important to use salt

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:90%
with the iodine.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What do
you think is going

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
to happen in the next 10
years with thyroid and iodine

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:90%
deficiency?

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I think
as the laypeople

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:84%
become more informed and more
interested in their health

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and take more of
an effort and push

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:84%
this more, that's
what's going to push

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:90%
the wheel the other way.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.372 align:middle line:84%
I do think things
will turn, but I

00:32:57.372 --> 00:32:59.580 align:middle line:84%
don't think it's going to
turn from the medical side.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to turn from
the patient side, which will

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:90%
force the medical side to turn.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What is the number
one thing you want our viewers

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.720 align:middle line:90%
to take away from this episode?

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I want to tell
the viewers that you don't have

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.972 align:middle line:90%
to suffer with chronic illness.

00:33:14.972 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:84%
If you're unhappy with
your medical care,

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:84%
if you're taking drugs
that aren't helping you,

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:84%
that you think are making
you sicker, let's search

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.260 align:middle line:90%
for a better alternative.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can take
control of your health,

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can learn
about the things

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.250 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
do from my books,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:84%
from other people that
have written books.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to you to take
charge of your health care

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:90%
and make the right decisions.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: People can read
the book "Overcoming Thyroid

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Disorders," which gives you a
general overview of the things

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.370 align:middle line:84%
you need to know on how you
can become healthy again,

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:84%
how you can adjust your
thyroid, how to recognize

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:90%
some of the symptoms.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Where can people get additional
information about you?

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:84%
How can they keep up
with this growing trend?

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So I've
written 15 books.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:58.790 align:middle line:10%
They're all available on my
website, wwww.drbrownstein.com,

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:10%
and I only write
about what works.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.250 align:middle line:10%
And if it works
in my practice, it

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.230 align:middle line:10%
should work everywhere
else too, because that's

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.132 align:middle line:10%
what's working in my
practice right now.

00:34:08.132 --> 00:34:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Dr.
Brownstein, thank you

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.447 align:middle line:90%
so much for coming on today.

00:34:11.447 --> 00:34:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being on
"The Healing Matrix."

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:84%
We really appreciate all
of your years of research

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and dedication to
helping so many people

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.839 align:middle line:84%
around the world who suffer
from thyroid disorders.

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Thank you.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.060 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD: As you've seen,
the proper functioning

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:10%
of the thyroid gland
is of utmost importance

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:10%
to our health.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, there are very
few in the medical profession

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:36.770 align:middle line:10%
today who truly
understand or are

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:41.030 align:middle line:10%
willing to speak out on the real
causes of thyroid dysfunction.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:45.409 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, Dr. David Brownstein
has zeroed in on the key role

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that iodine deficiency
plays in thyroid disease.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.750 align:middle line:84%
We hope you've taken
away from this program

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need to suffer
with the symptoms of thyroid

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.010 align:middle line:84%
With this new understanding
of thyroid disorders,

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.950 align:middle line:84%
you too can get the
help you need to live

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:90%
your most vital, healthy life.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Be sure to watch
our next episode

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.410 align:middle line:84%

iodine and glandular cancers.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.020 align:middle line:90%
