00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:10%
>> A financial and
food industry analyst,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:10%
Robyn O'Brien has been called
food's Erin Brockovich.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:84%
After her own child experienced
a severe allergic reaction,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Robyn began a deep dive into
researching nutrition industry

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:84%
standards, and her
work has shed light

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
on the growing trend of food
allergies and sensitivities.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, she triggered
awareness concerning

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
the skyrocketing
price of EpiPens

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:84%
when she coined
the term Epigate.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
We are here to continue the
conversation and to ask,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
are we allergic to
food or allergic

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:90%
to what's been done to it?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Robyn,
for joining us again.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.980 align:middle line:84%
It's been about 10 years since
you published "The Unhealthy

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Truth."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.153 align:middle line:84%
What can you share with us
about the updates since then?

00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, naively--

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:10%
when we published
"The Unhealthy Truth"

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:10%
my partner was Random House.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:10%
And I naively
thought, there it is.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:84%
I've given this to the world,
and the research is there.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:90%
The data is there.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
going to go back

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:90%
to full-time financial industry.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
launching a hedge fund.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:90%
And the world said, no, no, no.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I was a mother four, and
they wanted to hear more.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:10%
And so they were asking
for more of the story.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:10%
And personally I had to
really stop and decide,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:10%
is this really how I need
to be spending my time?

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:84%
It was terrifying when
the book published.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of threats,
and they were coming

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of different forms.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And to protect my own children,
to protect my own family--

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
that was first and foremost
the concern that I had.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But then, at the
same time, I knew

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't unlearn what I knew.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
I had the ability

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
to help inspire and educate
other people into this change.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So the first couple of years
after the book published

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:90%
were pretty terrifying.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2011 I was
asked to give a TED talk.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I really had to, again, sit
down with my family and say,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:90%
do I want this exposure?

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Can we handle this exposure?

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.942 align:middle line:84%
Because when the book
had been published,

00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
we had been scheduled for
a bunch of media interviews

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
just across the board, and
really at the 11th hour

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
those media interviews
just all stepped back.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So we were sort of left
standing there exposed.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.637 align:middle line:84%
The Today Show covered
the launch of the book,

00:02:43.637 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and I will forever be grateful
to the executive producer

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
He's a dad of
sons, and he really

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see it through.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So there had been sort of
this quiet period between 2009

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:90%
and 2011.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I took the
stage in Austin, Texas

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
to give this TED talk, the
exposure was very real.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just said a prayer to
please let my heart speak,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:90%
that it really wasn't about me.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I felt a responsibility in
this message and information,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.235 align:middle line:84%
and to deliver it in a way
that people could hear it,

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
that their minds
and their hearts

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:84%
would open to hearing it
so that we could really

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
catalyze a movement to
really drive change.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
When that thing was posted
online, it went viral quickly.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
It's been translated
into dozens of languages,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's been viewed
around the world.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And with that came
another responsibility.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I, again, had to sort of
stop and say, do I accept this?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Do I step into this knowing that
there was risk in that, too?

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And as I did, again,
I did with faith

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and with love for
my four children

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that there was
the possibility that we

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
could really impact and
help a lot of people.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
What was fascinating
to me was that

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:90%
when that thing went online--

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and we were watching
it tick viral--

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
CEOs that reached out

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
was the CEO of Nestle's
frozen food division.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you can
say things I can't say,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and I need you to come out here
to Ohio and meet with my team.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're my
family, and we're not

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
participating in
these changes, and I'm

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
worried that my building is
going to go from five floors

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to four, to three,
to two, to one.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And there was so much heart
in that and so much truth.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if there
is a CEO inside the food

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
industry, especially
a company like Nestle,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that feels this strongly
and is this brave enough

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to step forward too, I know
that we can get this done.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:90%
And that was in April of 2011.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And from that point
on, we've been

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
engaged in conversations
with the food industry,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.928 align:middle line:84%
and you can see
where we are today.

00:04:41.928 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, General Mills
just announced today

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.310 align:middle line:84%
that they're converting acreage
to regenerative agriculture.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
We've got organic across
75% of the grocery store.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
80% of consumers are
choosing something organic.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So we really have a very
vibrant, robust conversation

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
about our food supply that
10 years ago was really

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:90%
just emerging.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So you must feel a tremendous
amount of support today

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
relative to 10 years ago,
feeling that you were out there

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
alone just trying to
wave a flag and say, hey,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:90%
there's something going on here.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And now the world is stepping
up, momentum is happening.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
personal growth that

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:90%
has been part of this journey--

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
you can't underestimate
how important that is.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And to be called into
a leadership position

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't
necessarily choose

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:90%
for yourself or your family--

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:90%
that's a pretty big calling.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And to really
figure out what that

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:84%
was going to take
personally to step

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
into that role-- and
especially as a woman.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, women are sort of--

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
we're held to
different standards.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.458 align:middle line:84%
And there are
different challenges.

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:84%
There are different
opportunities.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I really had to figure
out and study and learn

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
how to do that in the most
responsible way that I could.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I did study
a lot of people

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
that were presenting change.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
speechwriters and speech

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
givers that I studied was Martin
Luther King Jr., because he was

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.462 align:middle line:84%
trying to create radical
change, and he was

00:06:08.462 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:90%
trying to do it through love.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
that was my force,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:84%
was this love that I felt
and our ability to leverage

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:90%
that to create this change.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So I studied a bunch
of his speeches,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.060 align:middle line:84%
the way that he worked, the
way that he communicated.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I studied Al Gore because he was
so contentious in the climate

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.517 align:middle line:84%
movement and it
became political,

00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and I did not want this
to become political.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what
can we do to make

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
this nonpolitical, nonpartisan,
that this is a patriotic thing.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I also
studied Harvey Milk,

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:84%
because he was trying
to advance gay rights

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, you know, that's
a pretty controversial thing

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:90%
that he was doing.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And 10 years ago, to talk about
GMOs was really controversial.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that he did,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
which I incorporate into
every public presentation

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that I give, is he thanks
people for taking the time

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
to attend, for taking time
out of their schedules

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:90%
to be there in his audience.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think to acknowledge
that, that we all only have

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.292 align:middle line:84%
a certain number of
minutes in our day,

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
how are we going
to allocate those?

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm hoping
to invite people

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
into participating
in this change,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to really acknowledge
that they're

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:84%
giving those minutes of their
day which are so precious.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%
They're so precious.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't agree more.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So those were sort of
the three that I studied.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a female
role model or mentor.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I think probably the
one to me that I hold up

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:84%
as my North Star is
Jane Goodall, somebody

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
who has spent and devoted her
life to this cause, who I'm

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.703 align:middle line:84%
sure when she was in her 20s
and she was communicating

00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
with chimpanzees and
gorillas, people probably

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:90%
thought she was crazy.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So to sort of
embrace that change

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:84%
can feel very radical to people,
but to have that conviction

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and to build the support
around you that you

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:90%
need to really move it forward.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And as I thought
about that, I thought,

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.985 align:middle line:84%
anything that we've ever created
in our lives, in the world--

00:08:03.985 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
you think about the
buildings that we create,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:90%
the Eiffel Tower--

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:84%
they have this
supportive scaffolding

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that goes up around them
as we're building them.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.082 align:middle line:84%
As we're constructing these
things of greatness and beauty,

00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
there's this support
of scaffolding

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.373 align:middle line:90%
that goes around it.

00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, we
need that, too.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
We need it as people, as
we grow into leadership.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:84%
We need it as a
movement, as we grow

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:84%
into the strength and power
that this movement is today.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.215 align:middle line:84%
So that was always
part of my mindset was,

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
where does that come from--
that supportive scaffolding--

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that I know we need
to really create

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
this thing of
beauty and greatness

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.127 align:middle line:84%
that we all know
we need to create?

00:08:38.127 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>> To create change.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to thank
you, because it typically

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
is someone who doesn't want
to be a leader necessarily

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:90%
that makes a great leader.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
You didn't set out to be
out there doing something

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
important, but you actually
just set out to share something

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that had deep meaning
to you, and that you

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
know can contribute to
the betterment of humanity

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.525 align:middle line:90%
globally.

00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
leader that we need.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.483 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I think about when
I was in business school--

00:09:03.483 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I was studying
entrepreneurship and finance.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was offered this
job as a financial analyst

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:84%
on a team that managed
$20 billion in assets,

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.425 align:middle line:84%
my job was behind five
giant computer terminals,

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was just studying
everyday, and I love that.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
That was research,
and that was my mode.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was no public
presentation that was going on.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And really you just got
to be this research wonk,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I loved.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And that skill set was
absolutely fundamental

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%
in shifting into
this work today,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
because as my daughter was
diagnosed with food allergies,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.998 align:middle line:84%
I was able to set
up the same systems

00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that I had put in
place as an analyst

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
on the desk around the
situation of food allergy.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So is capturing headlines
and data and information

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.260 align:middle line:84%
the same way I used
to capture them

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:90%
for publicly-traded companies.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And, as such, you've created
quite an understanding

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:90%
of what we need to do.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you share some of the
research in the last 10 years

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that might update us on
food allergies in children

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening,
and what we're

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:90%
growing into as a culture?

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I think one of the things
that was probably the most

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
stunning for me is that we don't
actually count food allergy

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:90%
deaths in America.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully there is a
woman out of Vanderbilt

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
who is starting to
assemble a database,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately the data
that we have on food allergies

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
is not robust, and
it is not as sound

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
as I wish that it could be.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that about 1
in 10 or 1 in 11 kids in every

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:84%
classroom now have
a food allergy--

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:84%
so that's about two
kids per classroom--

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and that the rate of food
allergies increased 265%--

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
the hospitalizations related
to food allergic reactions--

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
increased 265% percent
from 1997 until 2007.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's not a mom saying, oh,
my kid's allergic to something.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
That is a doctor checking
somebody into the ER.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we saw that
265% increase.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that data I
thought, what has changed?

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Because that's an epidemic.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden a statistic
that has shot up that high--

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and I had to sort
of step back, and I

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
started doing digging,
and again looking

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
for food allergy data in
these government databases.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it
doesn't exactly exist.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
What we do have is data for
the publicly-traded companies.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a company like
Mylan that sells the EpiPen,

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.993 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough, sales have been
absolutely through the roof.

00:11:17.993 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a billion dollar brand.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
It went from a
$200 million brand

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:90%
to a billion dollar brand.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So, just for reference,
another billion dollar brand

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.365 align:middle line:90%
is a company like Cheerios.

00:11:25.365 --> 00:11:26.165 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:26.165 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:90%
These are like household names.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So to look at that and say, OK,
so there's obviously use here.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The consumer is
buying this thing.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
We obviously have a
hospitalization rate

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:90%
that is through the roof.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:90%
So what has changed?

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I, again, kind
of put into the system

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that I had used as an analyst
to try to capture headlines.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember in October of
2006 a headline came through

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and it said, Michigan
State University

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
received a small
grant from the EPA.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And they had received a
grant of about $440,000

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to study whether or not
genetically-engineered foods

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:90%
cause food allergies.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So as an analyst-- the guys had
put me on the food industry,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and I had learned these models
inside and out, from Kroger,

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to Costco, to all these
publicly-traded food

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:09.883 align:middle line:90%
companies--

00:12:09.883 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, what's a
genetically-engineered food?

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
We didn't cover
this on the desk.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.833 align:middle line:84%
And so I start researching
genetically-engineered food,

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and realized that according
to the US Patent and Trademark

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Office, the first patent on
these foods were filed in 1984.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
They were issued
in 1988, and then

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.733 align:middle line:84%
really widely put into the
food system in the mid-1990s.

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
The first
genetically-engineered product

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.865 align:middle line:84%
put into the food system was
recombinant bovine growth

00:12:33.865 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
hormone, which is an
artificial growth hormone that

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:90%
helps cows make more milk.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.973 align:middle line:84%
So, the financial side
of me is thinking, is

00:12:40.973 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that a bad thing if cows
are making more milk?

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:90%
That puts more supply out.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.120 align:middle line:84%
That's lowering cost
to the consumer.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But when I realized that
the rest of the world

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:84%
had not allowed this artificial
growth hormone into the dairy

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
supply, that all of
our trading partners

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:84%
from Europe, the UK,
Japan, Asia, China, Russia,

00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Singapore--

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:84%
they had said, we don't
want introduce this risk

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:90%
into our dairy.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that they
saw that it increased mastitis

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
in the dairy animals,
clinical lameness, ovarian

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
cysts, and then
that also increased

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
drug and antibiotic
use in those animals.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So, for all of those
reasons they said,

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
we're going to keep this
out of our food system.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And in 1994 that was
introduced into ours.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment I can remember
sitting in the rocking chair

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that night, putting my
fourth child to bed,

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and just thinking,
how many sippy cups

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:84%
did I put this milk in and
how many bowls of cereal

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:90%
did I pour it on?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:84%
How much have we
consumed of this milk,

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that this
artificial growth hormone went

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:84%
into production in 1994, when
all of our trading partners

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
didn't allow it?

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
heartache in that moment

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:90%
to realize what I didn't know.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.333 align:middle line:84%
And so with that I started
pulling on this tread

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and trying to
understand what else

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:90%
had been genetically-engineered.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And in 1996, a few years
later, the introduction

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.215 align:middle line:84%
of genetically-engineered
soybeans.

00:14:03.215 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, sort of the
analysts in me thought,

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:90%
why would a company do this?

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the company that did it
was responsible for selling

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.985 align:middle line:90%
a weed-killer called Roundup.

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
able to do was

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
genetically-engineer
the soybean seed

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
so that it could withstand
increasing doses of Roundup.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a brilliant
business model

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.590 align:middle line:84%
if you're that chemical
company, because you're

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
ensuring revenue
growth of Roundup,

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly
the soybean seed

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:90%
can withstand increasing doses.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So that revenue
line is going up.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But what they also did
which was brilliant

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
was that, by patenting that
genetically-engineered soybean,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:84%
they then could charge
the farmer licensing

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
fees, trait fees,
and royalty fees,

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.103 align:middle line:84%
and that farmer had to repeat
purchase that seed every year.

00:14:46.103 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a model we're
actually familiar with.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:84%
You think about,
like, Microsoft Office

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
where you have to
renew your purchase

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:90%
year after year after year--

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.713 align:middle line:90%
any kind of licensing system.

00:14:54.713 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they
created in the food system

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:90%
in the mid-1990s.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.885 align:middle line:84%
And so, as a chemical company,
if I had been on that board

00:15:01.885 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:90%
I would've said, wow.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:90%
This is brilliant.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Look at all these revenue
streams that are coming in.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
What happened was, the
farmer all of a sudden

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
had to pay for an entirely
different model in agriculture

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:90%
that had never existed before.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So prior to that, a
farmer could save a seed.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But now that the seed carried
these licensed traits,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:84%
he was not allowed
to save the seed,

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and so he had to
repeat purchase.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that he
had to pay the royalty fee,

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.678 align:middle line:84%
and then on top of that the
licensing fee, and on top

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:90%
of that the trait fee.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So now here we are, 20, 25
years later, and the US farmer

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is carrying $426 billion of
debt for the US farm economy,

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and the median
income for a farmer

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is somewhere around
negative $1,600.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Which means, for the
year, he's in the negative

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:90%
by $1,600-and-something.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And as I thought
about that I thought,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:84%
we really do have a crisis
with our agricultural and food

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:90%
system in the US.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if I were a 30-year-old
farmer thinking about moving

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
my family to Nebraska,
and I go out to this town

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's gone from
four high schools down

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.820 align:middle line:84%
to one and everybody around me
is carrying mountains of debt,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and there's a suicide epidemic
and an opioid epidemic,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
what incentive
would a 30-year-old

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:84%
have to step into
that business model?

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion,
what role does GMO

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
play in what you've seen in
the roles of lack of healing

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:90%
and obesity in our culture?

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I think, for example,
if you were to take a Japanese

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:84%
child that is eating soybean
that's been grown the same way

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
for, say, hundreds of years,
versus an American child that

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
is eating a patented,
genetically-engineered,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Roundup-ready soybean
that has been treated--

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:90%
the seed has been treated--

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and then on top of that
the repeat application

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
of Roundup, the weed-killer
across those soybean fields.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.883 align:middle line:84%
So one child is
digesting something

00:16:54.883 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:84%
without all of these
applications to it.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
The other child is digesting
something in keeping with.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle line:84%
That difference was why
I have fought so hard

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
for GMO labeling,
because I thought

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.621 align:middle line:84%
we deserved to be able to
make an informed choice.

00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we just think
we're eating a soybean.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
But this soybean that the
Japanese child is eating

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:84%
is so different to the soybean
that the American child

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:90%
is eating.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.073 align:middle line:84%
So I took it a step further and
actually met with an allergist

00:17:17.073 --> 00:17:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and I said, when you are testing
my child for a soy allergy,

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
are you using an
organic soybean?

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Are you using a non-GMO,
non-genetically-engineered

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:90%
soybean?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Are you using a
Roundup-ready soybean?

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And she just laughed.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:90%
She said, I have no idea.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a soybean.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.542 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, even now within the
medical professional community,

00:17:37.542 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
it's like-- they
don't know either.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I think that
lack of transparency

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:84%
has been incredibly
detrimental to our health.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know the
type of car that you drive.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:84%
You know the type of
clothes that you buy.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
You know the type of shoe
that you like to wear.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we buy computers, Intel
is really proud to say, hey,

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:90%
there's Intel inside.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told there
was Monsanto inside.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So, again, if you are so proud
of this product, wouldn't you

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.385 align:middle line:90%
want to label it?

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:07.185 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
If someone buys
organic milk now,

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
is it truly safe and
free of the enzymes

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:90%
that you're referencing?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I think what is great
about the USDA Organic standard

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84%
is it's actually
a legal standard.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, by law, the production
of USDA Organic foods--

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
they're not allowed to
use genetically-engineered

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:84%
ingredients, which include
recombinant bovine growth

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:90%
hormone.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So by law, that
artificial growth hormone

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:84%
is not allowed in the
production of organic milk.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, the consumer
gets hit with label fatigue.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.545 align:middle line:84%
And here I had been
in the food industry,

00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
but even when I began
the work I didn't

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
realize that the USDA Organic
seal was a legal standard.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.428 align:middle line:84%
And so, by law, those
foods are produced

00:18:54.428 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
without genetically-engineered
ingredients,

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
without a toxic
weed-killer like Roundup.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
They're produced without
artificial colors.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They're produced without
artificial growth hormone,

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:90%
without irradiation.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.070 align:middle line:90%
And this one got me.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
They're produced
without sewage sludge.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So, what you're
actually buying into

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:84%
is a system that is free
from this set of ingredients.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And we can count on that?

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, by law.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a traceability
and there's an accountability.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a checks
and balances that's

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
required by producers
every step of the way.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think the
opportunity in the United

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
States is-- and this
is crazy to me--

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
only 1% of our farmland in
the United States is organic.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So we've got 911 million
acres of farmable land

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, but
less than 1% is organic.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And to show how quickly the food
industry has come on board--

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.037 align:middle line:84%
and I am super-grateful
for the teams

00:19:47.037 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:90%
inside of these companies.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman at
Anheuser-Busch InBev

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
that is really on top of the
procurement and the supply

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:90%
chain.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And they've just launched
a Super Bowl commercial

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:90%
that speaks exactly to that.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.730 align:middle line:84%
They're like, hey, we've got
beers that Americans love,

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's the seventh fastest
selling beer in America.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:90%
They're organic beer.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet 1% of farmland
in America is organic.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So help us convert
farmland in America.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Your six-pack goes to converting
six more acres, or whatever

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think what is exciting
to see is how creative the food

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:84%
industry is now,
engaging the consumer

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and inviting that participation
and that collaboration.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we've inherited a
food system that is broken.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And we also have inherited
a financial system

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.750 align:middle line:90%
that is broken.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I believe you cannot fix
a broken food system with

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:90%
a broken financial system.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is,
it's an open invitation

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.692 align:middle line:84%
for collaboration,
creativity, and innovation.

00:20:44.692 --> 00:20:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
makes sort of where

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:90%
we stand right now so exciting.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Because, at 1% there's so
much room to run that back.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So much room for
improvement and for expansion.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.073 align:middle line:84%
So you're kind of
saying there's hope.

00:20:56.073 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I totally believe
there's hope.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.782 align:middle line:10%
But I think what's interesting--
and I come from Texas.

00:20:59.782 --> 00:21:02.142 align:middle line:10%
So we've spoken to farmers
and they're like, look.

00:21:02.142 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:84%
If I were to bring up
the word "organic,"

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
my kid's not going to
make the football team.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:90%
And I get that.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I understand that,
culturally, because I

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
was raised understanding
and with friendships

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.670 align:middle line:90%
that are in that place.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, to sort of
say, how do we meet a farmer

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:90%
where he or she is?

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
fascinating is

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.202 align:middle line:84%
that the regenerative farming
movement is doing exactly that.

00:21:24.202 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
The challenge for
the food industry

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:84%
is that regenerative doesn't
have that legal definition.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you're marketing
towards a consumer

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
without a legal definition,
that becomes a little bit fuzzy.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's a challenge.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But for the farmer,
what they're seeing

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.775 align:middle line:84%
is, if I shift to these
regenerative practices--

00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and what that
means basically is,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
you're really focusing
on soil health.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
If you're focusing
on soil health,

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
you're realizing
these chemical inputs

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that we have been putting onto
the soil time and time and time

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:90%
again--

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.973 align:middle line:90%
let's lift that off.

00:21:50.973 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And what the farmers
are finding--

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.432 align:middle line:84%
there's one in Indiana
that we recently met with.

00:21:54.432 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, just by shifting
to regenerative practices,

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.475 align:middle line:84%
I went from spending
half a million dollars

00:22:00.475 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:84%
on chemical inputs every
single year to $734 a year.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowing what you know,
what products, staple items,

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:90%
need to be organic in our lives?

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.488 align:middle line:90%
>> The thing you eat the most.

00:22:14.488 --> 00:22:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a different
answer for everybody.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But really, whatever
you consume the most,

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:84%
your family consumes
the most, make

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.630 align:middle line:84%
sure it is free from these
artificial ingredients

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and make sure, where
you can, that it's

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:84%
free from these
synthetic pesticides

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and these synthetic weed
killers like Roundup.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think about
that Roundup bottle

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and how it says "keep out
of the reach of children,"

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and you think about,
as young mothers,

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.170 align:middle line:84%
you're told not to put stuff
under your kitchen sink

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.878 align:middle line:84%
and keep it out of
the reach of children.

00:22:42.878 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this has been
sprayed on our food system,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:84%
on our food supply
for 20-plus years.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Would I have this bottle
on my kitchen table,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.783 align:middle line:84%
spraying it on a
salad or spraying it

00:22:53.783 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:90%
on my children's meal?

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So, again, how can a consumer
make an informed choice?

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think, by law, that
USDA Organic standard

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:90%
is a great start.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, because of
the supply chain constraints

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and that only 1% of our
farmland is organic,

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:84%
it puts it at a
price point that's

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.810 align:middle line:90%
out of reach to too many people.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm extremely
grateful to companies

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:84%
like Kroger and Costco
who really said,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
we see what the consumer wants.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.590 align:middle line:84%
We see that that price
point is out of reach,

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:84%
so we're actually going to
create our own private label

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and create this
in-house so that we

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.090 align:middle line:84%
can bring the price point
down to hopefully reach

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.350 align:middle line:90%
more consumers.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think when that
happened, which was in 2012,

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:84%
when Kroger actually launched
their private organic label,

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
that really was
what I think began

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
to shift the conversation.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Because up until that
point it had sort of

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:84%
been that Whole Foods, whole
paycheck image of organic.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And for me, if
somebody were to say,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Robyn, what's your
personal mission?

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say, it's to
make clean and safe food

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.240 align:middle line:84%
affordable and accessible
to anyone who wants it.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And until we're there, we
haven't solved this problem.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So, someone has food
allergies currently.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Is going to an
organic diet enough?

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Does it change for them?

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We've seen a lot of families
shift to a diet that is free

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:84%
from all of these
artificial ingredients,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:90%
go to an organic diet.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:84%
You can measure pesticide levels
in the urine of those families,

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's just phenomenal the
change that you will see.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the long-term
studies that we

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.540 align:middle line:84%
need that I can conclusively
answer that with?

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.393 align:middle line:84%
We don't have those
long-term studies.

00:24:30.393 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
What is absolutely awesome
is that the University

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:84%
of California has just launched
an organic research institute.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So, again, right now we're
sort of in this place

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.380 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, he said,
she said on the science.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, we could be in
that place for a hundred years.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Families will tell you,
if they shift the diet,

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:84%
they see all of these different
changes in their own health,

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:90%
the health of their children.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The naysayers will say,
that's anecdotal evidence.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think, again, to
really think about--

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
like you started with,
what is food without all

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:90%
of these applications?

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.320 align:middle line:84%
What is food without
the genetic engineering?

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And the industry that
genetically engineers foods

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.368 align:middle line:84%
will come back and say, but we
need this to feed the world.

00:25:12.368 --> 00:25:13.168 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:13.168 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh, let me
just pull your heartstrings.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds like a great
argument, until you step back

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
data from the USDA

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and from the United
Nations, and it shows us

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that globally we waste
30% to 40% of the food

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:90%
that we produce.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So we actually have enough
food to feed the world.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
What we have is a
distribution problem.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So how can we make organic
food production more efficient?

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think where we stand
today in the 21st century

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
with the technologies
that we have

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and drone technologies
and the technologies

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:84%
that we can see on farm
and in tractors-- it

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.500 align:middle line:84%
is phenomenal where
we are with technology

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:90%
today versus 50 years ago.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Take that technology
on farm, marry it

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:84%
with organic food
production and create

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.907 align:middle line:84%
21st-century organic
food production.

00:25:56.907 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:84%
That's going to look a
whole lot different to what

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
organic might have looked
like 30 or 40 years ago.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So to me, again, I think
there is enormous opportunity.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've just started
teaching a class--

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm an adjunct
professor at Rice--

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:90%
called The New Food Economy.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's exactly that.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a business
school class, and it's

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:84%
inviting these students to
come in and participate.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.713 align:middle line:84%
And we just asked them for their
projects for this semester,

00:26:18.713 --> 00:26:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and one of them came
back and they said,

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
we want to create a
zero-waste grocery store.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine
the impact there.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Imagine the impact.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So that, to me,
is the opportunity

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.045 align:middle line:90%
that's in front of all of us.

00:26:30.045 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's time.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So you speak
about an 80-20 rule.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:90%
What can you say about that?

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So that, I think, maybe was
because I had four kids and I

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:84%
realized-- navigating this as
a mother in a very real world.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And so for us it was,
do the best job you can

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.867 align:middle line:84%
80% of the time, knowing
that 20% of the time they're

00:26:49.867 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:90%
going to be at birthday parties.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:90%
The real world happens.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:90%
You're on the fly.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Something gives.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:90%
In a perfect world, yes.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:84%
We would all have access to
free-from food and organic food

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
100% of the time, but we
don't live in that world.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So what can we do to move
further along the spectrum?

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think for me that was
always what was so important,

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:90%
was not to alienate people.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:12.850 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.030 align:middle line:84%
The fact that organic still is
not yet within reach for all

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:84%
families-- you know,
there really are--

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.950 align:middle line:84%
these are pretty gentle,
delicate conversations.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So how can a parent become
an excellent food allergy

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:90%
detective?

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.710 align:middle line:90%
What do they look for?

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my book,
"The Unhealthy Truth,"

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
was published 10 years
ago, and it still holds.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
great data in there

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:84%
to really walk people
through exactly what happened

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and to understand
the changes that

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.640 align:middle line:84%
were made to our food system
without our knowledge,

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:90%
without labels.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some
really basic things.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Where you can
afford USDA organic,

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.390 align:middle line:84%
it is absolutely
worth the purchase

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
because it's free from
these synthetic pesticides

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and genetically-engineered
ingredients

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:90%
and artificial colors.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.880 align:middle line:84%
There were studies done
called the Southampton Study.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It was in the UK and it studied
the impact of artificial colors

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.502 align:middle line:84%
on the hyperactivity
and ADHD of children.

00:28:08.502 --> 00:28:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were these
double-blind studies,

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.120 align:middle line:84%
which meant, as you would know,
that the doctors didn't know.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:90%
The kids didn't know.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:14.950 align:middle line:90%
The parents didn't know.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:84%
These kids were fed
foods, and they didn't

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:90%
know what they were getting.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And the results were so
conclusive that these

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
artificial colors created this
hyperactivity in children,

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that the food industry,
which includes our American

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:84%
companies-- so, companies like
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Kellogg's--

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
voluntarily removed
the artificial colors

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:84%
from the products that
they sell overseas.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So, as I was learning all of
this information, when I landed

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:84%
on that double standard-- that
our own food companies were

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:84%
producing products without
these artificial ingredients

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.720 align:middle line:84%
for families
overseas but putting

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
the artificial ingredients into
the products for our families

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
here in the US--
that was intolerable.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:90%
And that is intolerable.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:90%
It does not matter my audience.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.883 align:middle line:84%
I have been in front
of farmers that

00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:00.550 align:middle line:84%
are growing
genetically-engineered corn,

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and when I land on
that talking point

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:90%
it is universally offensive.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, we
were saying, we're

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:84%
not asking you guys
to reinvent the wheel.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:84%
You're already doing this for
families in other countries.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:84%
We're simply asking you
to place the same value

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:84%
on our kids' lives here
in the United States.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And many countries that won't
exchange with our other foods

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're not making
those adaptations to,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.090 align:middle line:90%
they say, no thank you.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.990 align:middle line:84%
You keep your
abundance over there.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Meanwhile, we're getting
sicker and sicker and sicker.

00:29:30.165 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think, for me,
especially in a year where

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
we're having a presidential
debate and you've got all these

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
smart candidates on stage
talking about health care,

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're not talking
about our food system.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Food is the most important
input in any health care system.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I would love is for
that to be part of the debate.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.040 align:middle line:84%
As you look at the health care
system and the burden of cost

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:84%
not only on families and
companies but on our economy,

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.310 align:middle line:84%
that 20% of our GDP is
now spent on health care

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
costs and disease
management, what

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
would you, candidate
A, B, C, D, E,

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.448 align:middle line:90%
do to address the food system?

00:30:03.448 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you looking at,
the cause behind the cause?

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:90%
As a true leader would do.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> If they were
truly interested.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Very, very excellent.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So, let's speak into the food
allergy piece for a moment.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The first time someone
encounters a food,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.877 align:middle line:84%
do they have an
allergic reaction?

00:30:19.877 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Does it happen later?

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Adult?

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Children?

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, I think people
want that formula.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.870 align:middle line:90%
They want an equation.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what it is.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what to look for.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately, that is the
challenge in this condition,

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.710 align:middle line:84%
as it can present in
so many different ways.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.722 align:middle line:84%
I remember, when we
were first starting,

00:30:34.722 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
people didn't think that
you could have multiple food

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:37.730 align:middle line:90%
allergies.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And now that has been
completely dismissed.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
There are families
and children that

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.220 align:middle line:90%
have multiple food allergies.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.720 align:middle line:84%
There are people that have gone
50 years, 60 years, 70 years

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.012 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of food
allergic reaction who suddenly

00:30:48.012 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:84%
go into anaphylaxis at a
restaurant having shrimp,

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.700 align:middle line:84%
after eating it
their entire life.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So, unfortunately
there's not a formula,

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's why I
think understanding

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
what the symptoms
are of anaphylaxis

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.975 align:middle line:84%
in a food allergic reaction are
just so critically-important.

00:31:00.975 --> 00:31:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And what about the delayed
responses to allergens?

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I think of two families who
have lost children due to that

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:90%
delayed response.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:84%
There was a young
boy named Oakley,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:90%
and he is out of Florida.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was over Thanksgiving
he had a bite of a cookie that

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.100 align:middle line:84%
contained one of
his nut allergens,

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and for most of the night
he had a stomach ache

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and had some trouble
breathing, but the parents

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:90%
thought it was a stomachache.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was too late
by the time they

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:44.400 align:middle line:84%
realized it was a delayed
onset of an acute anaphylactic

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:90%
reaction.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately, we
continue to hear those stories.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So for families that are aware
that their child has a food

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:57.240 align:middle line:84%
allergy, if a child goes
into any kind of state

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of discomfort,
whether it's hives,

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:84%
whether it's breathing trouble,
and whether it's a stomach

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:06.540 align:middle line:84%
ache, your safest bet is to
get that child to the emergency

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:90%
room and administer epinephrine.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, there are
multiple companies now

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.270 align:middle line:84%
that are coming online
with alternative devices

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:84%
to the EpiPen, because that
had so aggressively pushed

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.050 align:middle line:84%
the price point up by 600%
over the last couple of years.

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.300 align:middle line:84%
There are others
like AVI-Q that are

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.040 align:middle line:84%
trying to be more
user-friendly, started

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:84%
by twin boys that
grew up to start

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
this company to really kind
of help address the market.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think to always have
the epinephrine on hand--

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
do not be afraid to
administer it and call 911.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.500 align:middle line:84%
If you have any concern that
your child is experiencing

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:84%
some discomfort, breathing
discomfort, skin rash, hives,

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle line:84%
you've got to act quickly
because the stories that

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.530 align:middle line:84%
are on the other
side are heartache.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the most common
allergies that would end up

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
requiring EpiPen,
hospitalization, et cetera?

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So, the peanut allergy
is incredibly pervasive.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Dairy allergy is
incredibly pervasive.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:84%
There were studies
that just came out

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:84%
a couple years ago of
the insurance claims

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:90%
that have been filed for--

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.430 align:middle line:84%
the number of people
that are filing

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.882 align:middle line:84%
claims due to a food
allergic reaction.

00:33:16.882 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's fascinating.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
It speaks to how ubiquitous
this condition has become.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
little kid thing.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.300 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it
across all age groups.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.520 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it across
all ethnicities.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So, again, this
raising awareness

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:84%
of what these symptoms
actually look like.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But shellfish, nuts,
egg, dairy, wheat.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.020 align:middle line:84%
They can all trigger the
same life-threatening, acute

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.510 align:middle line:90%
allergic reaction.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think, from some
of the families who

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.030 align:middle line:84%
have lost their
children, they've

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.670 align:middle line:84%
shared stories-- there was
a young girl named Emily,

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and her dad reached out at the
very beginning of this work.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, she had always been
able to manage the reactions.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.170 align:middle line:84%
They just never got
that bad, until they

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:90%
got so bad that it killed her.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So, again, unfortunately
there's not a formula.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.750 align:middle line:90%
There's not a playbook here.

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as parents,
it's our responsibility

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:84%
to know as much
as we can possibly

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:84%
know about the condition, and be
as prepared as we can possibly

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.420 align:middle line:90%
be at any given time.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
responsibility is enormous.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
And it weighs very heavy, which
is why you see such community

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.150 align:middle line:90%
around this condition.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.340 align:middle line:84%
The Facebook groups that
form are incredible.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.250 align:middle line:84%
The women and the moms
and some of the dads

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.940 align:middle line:84%
that really have stepped forward
as leaders in this space--

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.482 align:middle line:84%
they're incredible human beings
with just the biggest hearts.

00:34:28.482 --> 00:34:29.282 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:34:29.282 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:84%
So, I want to just add
into this conversation

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:84%
that, when we are
alkalizing in the body

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.929 align:middle line:84%
we have a bigger buffer to
be able to shoulder that

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:40.270 align:middle line:84%
without having the
dramatic reactions.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.215 align:middle line:84%
So, thank you so
much for the work

00:34:42.215 --> 00:34:43.340 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing in that--

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, so, quick question.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So where could someone go
to learn more about how

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.350 align:middle line:90%
to alkalinize the body?

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.989 align:middle line:84%
>> So, on my website I provide
information about that--

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:54.869 align:middle line:90%
drsuemorter.com--

00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:58.140 align:middle line:84%
so that people can learn
how to consume the foods

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in proportions that are going to
help the system run the way it

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:84%
was designed to be running,
edging up that alkaline reserve

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.120 align:middle line:84%
all the while so that
our buffering system is

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.180 align:middle line:84%
in place to help with
what you're describing.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.810 align:middle line:90%
So I want to shift into this--

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.170 align:middle line:84%
you're a co-founder
of rePlant Capital.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Please share with us what
is behind that initiative.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about it.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm so excited.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I work with an amazing team.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
My co-founders come out
of Impact Investments

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.710 align:middle line:90%
and private equity.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.645 align:middle line:84%
They've been at it for
a couple of decades.

00:35:33.645 --> 00:35:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And we came together
as a team probably

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.310 align:middle line:90%
about two or three years ago.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was sort of
with growing frustration

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that the only source
of capital that

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.780 align:middle line:84%
was coming into the food
industry was really attractive,

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's Wall Street.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.687 align:middle line:84%
And that these
publicly-traded companies

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:84%
were beholden to the
metrics of Wall Street.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.945 align:middle line:84%
And having been
that side of things,

00:35:51.945 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:84%
it was probably three
or four years ago

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.653 align:middle line:84%
where I was sitting there
and I thought, you know,

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:59.180 align:middle line:84%
they're grading these
companies on metrics from 1985,

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:90%
and we've moved so far forward.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And for the companies
to change, the metrics

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.530 align:middle line:90%
actually have to change.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And so for Wall Street
to get into this

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and realize, instead of judging
them the way they judged them

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.450 align:middle line:84%
in 1985, on these
quarterly earnings

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:14.330 align:middle line:84%
calls could they be asking what
percentage of your farmland

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:90%
is organic?

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:84%
What programs do you have
in place with your growers

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and your ranchers
to help convert

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:90%
your farmland to organic?

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.050 align:middle line:84%
What's the debt levels of
your growers and your ranchers

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and what programs
do you have in place

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
to lower that debt level
so that more farmers can

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:90%
convert into organic?

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so to recognize
that capital is actually

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
ingredients in the food system,

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and if it comes at you
and it's very extractive,

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.860 align:middle line:84%
then that food system is
going to be extractive.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.027 align:middle line:84%
If capital is
regenerative, then you

00:36:42.027 --> 00:36:43.610 align:middle line:84%
can create a
regenerative food system.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.735 align:middle line:84%
So I realized you couldn't
really actually separate

00:36:45.735 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:90%
those two things.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.025 align:middle line:84%
And so we came
together as a team

00:36:48.025 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and we realized-- we sort
of had to have four parts.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.770 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have the farmer.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And we recognize that not
all farmers are there,

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.238 align:middle line:84%
but we'll meet them
where they are.

00:36:55.238 --> 00:36:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
curiosity right now because

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.900 align:middle line:84%
of the economic hardship
and the suicides

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and the opioid epidemics
and then the soil

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:03.750 align:middle line:90%
health challenges.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So the farmers, and then
the technical assistance.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So the other farmers
who can teach,

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.020 align:middle line:84%
who can be out there on the farm
and really show them these soil

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.120 align:middle line:84%
practices,
regenerative practices

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that reduce their
chemical inputs

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.495 align:middle line:84%
and lead to these
different outcomes.

00:37:18.495 --> 00:37:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And then what was
also really important

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.080 align:middle line:84%
was that we had a
guaranteed buyer,

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
because it takes three years
for a farmer to convert

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:90%
from conventional to organic.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.155 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a three-year--

00:37:28.155 --> 00:37:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're staring
down three years

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of like, what's going to
be out here on the end?

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And so to have these
companies come in and say,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
guarantee we're going

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.372 align:middle line:84%
to be here in three
years' time to buy that,

00:37:37.372 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:90%
and then to have the capital.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So those four pieces were
critically-important to us,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.538 align:middle line:84%
and we realized that we could
be this financial services

00:37:43.538 --> 00:37:45.830 align:middle line:84%
firm that came in with these
innovative loan structures

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.247 align:middle line:84%
to really work with the farmers
to have them at the table.

00:37:48.247 --> 00:37:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The farmer's never
been at the table.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:51.497 align:middle line:90%
He's never been at the table.

00:37:51.497 --> 00:37:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And some of these food
companies like Danone

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.280 align:middle line:84%
actually have
incredible visibility

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and incredible relationships
with their farmers

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and with their growers and
with their different providers,

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and other companies
don't have a clue.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So, again, it's really sitting
down with the food industry

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and saying, instead of working
with extractive capital

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that's forcing you onto this
quarterly earnings model,

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.280 align:middle line:84%
could you sit down
with regenerative

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.220 align:middle line:84%
capital and what
would that look like?

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And we've created all
these different systems

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.070 align:middle line:90%
in other industries.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.580 align:middle line:84%
You think about
like fossil fuel,

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and we've gone to
solar and wind energy.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And you think about
conventional ag,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and we've gone to
regenerative and organic.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.743 align:middle line:84%
We have a toxic
financial system.

00:38:28.743 --> 00:38:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So what would it look
like if we created

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.090 align:middle line:90%
a regenerative financial system?

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It's big stuff.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.550 align:middle line:84%
What do you see for the future
with companies like Monsanto

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and now Bayer?

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think it's
interesting because when that

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:84%
acquisition was made, when
Bayer acquired Monsanto,

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:84%
the former CEO of Bayer
didn't want to do it.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.780 align:middle line:84%
He actually wanted
to acquire Unilever,

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and he saw the shift
towards health.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:84%
He was shown the door, and
this new guy was brought in,

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.565 align:middle line:84%
and he agreed to
this acquisition.

00:39:00.565 --> 00:39:02.690 align:middle line:84%
He also knew that it wouldn't
win shareholder vote,

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:06.110 align:middle line:84%
so he didn't actually put
the Monsanto acquisition

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to shareholder vote, and
he was able to finance it

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.930 align:middle line:84%
with cash and debt in
order to avoid putting it

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:14.570 align:middle line:90%
to a shareholder vote.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the
acquisition, Bayer

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.730 align:middle line:84%
has lost the value of that
acquisition in their share

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:90%
price.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The acquisition was for
something like $63 billion,

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and Bayer's share price
just got absolutely hammered

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:84%
as all of these
lawsuits around Roundup

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and glyphosate started
to come online.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Today there are 43,000-something
lawsuits around the world

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.940 align:middle line:84%
as people really challenge
the safety of that product.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, it gets into the
he said, she said science,

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and I think we see a company
and an operating system that's

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.080 align:middle line:90%
dying.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's dying-- not
only consumer-facing.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I think probably
what's incredibly

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.610 align:middle line:84%
validating is to see the
farmer step forward and say,

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:01.200 align:middle line:84%
this is not working
for me anymore.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not working for my family.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not working for my legacy.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not working for my land.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:84%
We see companies that
have had tremendous power

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:14.030 align:middle line:84%
in a marketplace and own
that power for decades,

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.860 align:middle line:90%
and they suddenly go away.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I think the example that
comes to mind is Blockbuster.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You think about
Blockbuster as a company--

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.768 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had
stores on every corner.

00:40:24.768 --> 00:40:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's what we all did when
we wanted to see a movie.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:90%
We would go to Blockbuster.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.722 align:middle line:90%
And they had 100% market share.

00:40:30.722 --> 00:40:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And a company like
Monsanto in the United

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.070 align:middle line:84%
States, it's something
like 95% of acreage

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.800 align:middle line:84%
was genetically-engineered
corn and 90% of acreage

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.050 align:middle line:90%
was genetically-engineered soy.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.350 align:middle line:84%
They had a monopoly on our
US agricultural system,

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.350 align:middle line:84%
much like Blockbuster had
this monopoly on the way

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.948 align:middle line:90%
that we viewed videos.

00:40:47.948 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And at the time-- and this was
actually when I was an analyst

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.290 align:middle line:90%
on the desk--

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Netflix came to
Blockbuster and they

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:84%
said, we'd love
to work with you,

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.470 align:middle line:84%
because we see the
opportunity to stream video

00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:59.765 align:middle line:90%
content over the internet.

00:40:59.765 --> 00:41:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And the CEO of Blockbuster,
in his arrogance,

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.430 align:middle line:84%
said, well, who would want to
watch videos on the internet?

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And multiple times that founder
of Netflix came to Blockbuster.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it was born out
of his own pain of having

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to pay these late
fees that he thought,

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.390 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be a
better model here,

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.015 align:middle line:84%
was trying to create
this better model,

00:41:17.015 --> 00:41:19.900 align:middle line:84%
was actually trying to
partner with that big player,

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.392 align:middle line:84%
and the arrogance of the big
player didn't embrace it.

00:41:22.392 --> 00:41:24.600 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's exactly
what we're seeing here, is

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.710 align:middle line:10%
that you had an arrogance
and an operating system that

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:31.320 align:middle line:10%
has grown past its prime.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So today there's one
Blockbuster store.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.180 align:middle line:84%
It's in Portland, Oregon,
I think, or Eugene.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere up in Oregon.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think really that's
the opportunity to say,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:84%
we had this operating
system in the 20th century.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:84%
We realize now, in
the 21st century,

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:90%
that we can do a lot better.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And that to me is
opportunity in front of us.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>> And nature supports it.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.375 align:middle line:84%
Work with nature
instead of against it.

00:41:53.375 --> 00:41:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.890 align:middle line:90%
As if we had a better idea.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So now I'm going to ask you,
where can people go to learn

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.220 align:middle line:90%
more?

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.270 align:middle line:10%
>> I think there is so
much that we can do.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.850 align:middle line:10%
And thankfully there are
so many documentaries now

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.420 align:middle line:10%
that are online about
our food system.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.935 align:middle line:84%
The one that was probably
the most impactful for me--

00:42:14.935 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:84%
it's old now, but it's by a
friend of mine, Deborah Koons

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Garcia, and it's called
"The Future Of Food."

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And it really was one of those
films that really informs you

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.812 align:middle line:90%
in an incredibly powerful way.

00:42:26.812 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:90%
"Food, Inc." was another one.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.610 align:middle line:84%
When it hit it was
incredibly game-changing.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think The
Environmental Working Group--

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.370 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to
understand the pesticide

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.790 align:middle line:84%
levels on your produce,
the Environmental Working

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Group does an incredible job.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They produce every year a
list called the Dirty Dozen,

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and it tells you,
there are these 12

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:46.600 align:middle line:84%
pesticides on your
strawberries, and there

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.570 align:middle line:84%
are these 16 pesticides
on your spinach,

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.670 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the
number is every year.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.255 align:middle line:84%
But it's an incredibly
informed list.

00:42:52.255 --> 00:42:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think, back to your
earlier question of what should

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:84%
you buy or avoid, that list
is a really good roadmap

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.490 align:middle line:84%
to use as you navigate
the grocery store.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
think, where you can,

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to back away from
processed foods.

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think we actually know
more than we think we do.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually a lot more
capable than we think we are.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think about the
boxes of mac and cheese

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that I used to buy
in bulk from Costco,

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and just making
that gentle shift

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to just buying a bag
of noodles and boiling

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:24.330 align:middle line:84%
them the same way
without that whole list

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.580 align:middle line:84%
of artificial
ingredients on the side.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So, again, it's leverage
the intelligence

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:90%
of your grandparents.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I think they know so much.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm sure they're
scratching their heads, like,

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.540 align:middle line:90%
what are you even eating?

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.663 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:43:38.663 --> 00:43:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think most importantly,
don't make the perfect

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.430 align:middle line:84%
the enemy of the good, because
it can be really overwhelming.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And paralysis doesn't
get us anywhere.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.775 align:middle line:84%
So do what you can where
you are with what you have.

00:43:49.775 --> 00:43:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
incredibly important

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to embrace change at a pace
that you can embrace it.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.508 align:middle line:84%
I think about when we were
potty-training the kids

00:43:56.508 --> 00:43:58.050 align:middle line:84%
or teaching them
how to ride a bike--

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't happen overnight,
these kinds of changes.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't happen overnight.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Adaptation.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:04.883 align:middle line:90%
>> In our own favor.

00:44:04.883 --> 00:44:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much, Robyn,
for this most brilliant

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:90%
and insightful conversation.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.008 align:middle line:84%
I truly feel it might
just save someone's life.

00:44:14.008 --> 00:44:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You just gave me the chills.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.048 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:18.048 --> 00:44:20.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe the biggest
takeaway from our conversation

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:10%
today is, when it comes
to food allergens, GMOs,

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.760 align:middle line:10%
and the unhealthy truth
surrounding the food industry,

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.800 align:middle line:10%
that knowledge is power.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Robyn continues to inform
consumers and encourage

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.250 align:middle line:84%
a worldwide effort for
improved farming practices.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.530 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to wellness,
we know we can avoid

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.670 align:middle line:84%
prescriptions, alcohol, tobacco,
but the one thing we cannot cut

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:43.500 align:middle line:90%
out is food.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.900 align:middle line:84%
If we don't become
empowered in this matter,

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:90%
generations to come will suffer.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.950 align:middle line:90%
