one to go on a journey

Anahata Ananda, a healer
in Sedona, Arizona,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:84%
is the founder of an approach

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual awakening.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Anahata,
to "Healing Matrix."

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:10%
>>ANAHATA ANANDA: Oh,
it's such a pleasure

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.410 align:middle line:10%
to be a part of Gaia,
this platform that

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.951 align:middle line:10%
is really bringing consciousness
to millions of people.

00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:04.076 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for having me.

00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, our great pleasure.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:84%
We are delighted to be gathering
a community around the world

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to hold the space
for something deeper.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Yes, it's time.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Radical healing.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.035 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: It's time, really is.

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:16.118 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Wholeness, that's
what we're interested in.

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So tell us right off the bat,
what is shamanic healing?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:10%
>>ANANDA: Well, shamanic
healing goes really deep.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:10%
And this shamanic
traditions, there

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:10%
are so many around the
world, there isn't just one.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Shamanic healing does not just
address one modality, or one

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:90%
belief, or one tradition.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism covers a range
of different cultures,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:84%
different belief
systems, and traditions.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we can address with shamanism

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
is addressing the
deep core wounds.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is not afraid
to go into the shadows.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is not afraid
to face the fears,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:90%
to go into the darkness.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And with shamanism, there's
also a deep connection

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
with mother nature,
and the elements,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and the power that lies within.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And the courage to go take a
look at what's really there.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
There's many modalities that can
be addressed within shamanism.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:84%
We can have the
seer or the Oracle.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
We can have the healer that
does emotional clearing and soul

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:90%
retrieval.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:84%
We can have the medicine
man or the medicine

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:90%
woman that uses plants to heal.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Or breath.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And so there's many different
modalities within shamanism

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:90%
that we can leverage.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Anahata, how did you
get into shamanic healing?

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Well, it was
really from my own dark night

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.807 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a time in
my life where I was unhappy.

00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was following
somebody else's dream.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I was following what everybody
else's journey to happiness.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't really
fit who I was.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.972 align:middle line:84%
And so, I also had some
core wounds from childhood

00:02:54.972 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that I was taking into
adulthood and that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.245 align:middle line:84%
were sabotaging my life,
and my relationships,

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and my happiness, and
my health at the time.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And traditional modalities
were really not supporting me

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:90%
in getting at the core wounds.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And helping me learn
different tools and approaches

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:90%
to really empower and awaken.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, I sought out a
shamanic healer at the time

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to really help get
out the heaviness.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I was depressed, and
angry, and upset, and sad.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And didn't really
have the support

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:90%
to move through that properly.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And for me, traditional
modalities were falling short.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get
at the core stuff.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was a challenge
and courageous

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:90%
to try something different.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So had you
tried traditional?

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
What types of
modalities where you?

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: So
counseling, primarily.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, the
counseling that I was engaged in

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
was just touching the
tip of the iceberg

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and the issues were so much
deeper and below the surface.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about these
little incidental things

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and we weren't addressing
the core issues

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:90%
and what was underneath it all.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was quite frustrated
that we weren't really getting

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:90%
anywhere.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that there
were some core wounds that I

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:90%
was taking into my adult life.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And that I also didn't have the
tools to learn accountability,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
learn conscious communication,
and heal those issues

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:84%
from my past so that I could be
empowered in my relationships.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And take care of my
own energy and honor

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
my own emotional intelligence
and learn how to do that.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't raised that
way and most of us weren't.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to seek out
alternatives that would

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.810 align:middle line:90%
empower me as an individual.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And give me the
tools to be better

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
in relationships
and a better spouse,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and a better parent,
and a better human.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You mentioned,
there are many types

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of shamanic traditions,
which of those

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:90%
were you drawn to personally?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: For me, it was
deep emotional clearing.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So a friend of mine
referred me to a shaman

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
in LA that did a deep
emotional clearing.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And in that situation,
we went so deep

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that in my first
session rage would come up.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was angry.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:90%
I was irritated.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea that it was so
deep that rage would come out.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And so in our first
session, it was

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
so liberating to allow deep
anger from the disappointment

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.280 align:middle line:84%
of things that didn't go my way
and deep grief from the sadness

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
of losses and emotion that
had been oppressed for so

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:90%
many years, in fact, decades.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was so liberating to
have a safe, cathartic release

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
of all of this emotion
that had been oppressed.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
A safe space for anger and
a safe space for grief.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And it was so liberating.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.698 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so is this what you
do now with shamanic healing?

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:84%
You're providing the
environment for people

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:84%
to have these
cathartic experiences?

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share a little
bit about what you're doing.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Yeah, I
think it's so valuable

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
in the shamanic experience,
the deep emotional clearing

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:90%
to go into the pain.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:90%
And so shamangelic blends that.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Where we go into the darkness,
and the shadow, and the pain,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and the sadness and allow a safe
space for it to be released,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:90%
expressed.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And the angelic part,
which is a little

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
different than the shamanic
part, the angelic part

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.627 align:middle line:84%
does so with the
embrace of an angel.

00:06:38.627 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Let's take a
look at the work Anahata

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:90%
does with shamangelic healing.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:10%
- Hello, I'm Anahata
Ananda, your soul guide

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:10%
for empowerment and awakening.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:10%
And founder of
shamangelic Healing

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:10%
that is based right
here in Sedona, Arizona.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:10%
And I have guided
thousands of my clients

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:10%
through big core life shifts.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Supporting them with
the tools and the road

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
map to turn their life around
and create a thriving life

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:90%
that they absolutely love.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
But it started with a
catalyst, a wake up call.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Often, that's a
relationship drama.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who isn't going through
a challenge in the heart?

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes that's in the
form of a breakup or a divorce.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe a wound from the
past that hasn't healed.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Or just a troubled relationship
that you're having challenges

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
navigating how to
communicate clearly.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just
feeling stuck and stagnant

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
in a life that or a career that
feels kind of unfulfilling.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it doesn't fit any longer.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it never did.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's grief.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Dealing with the loss
of a loved one that

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
is just hard to move forward
and it's hard to heal.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
A loss of a loved one
or a chapter in life

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:84%
that you're grieving and
having trouble moving forward.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not uncommon with all
of this emotional chaos,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and stress, and not
knowing how to navigate it

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:84%
for it to overflow into some
unhealthy lifestyle patterns.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even leading to
some addictive behaviors.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Self-sabotaging things that
are really harmful or hurtful

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:90%
for you or others.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you relate to feeling
overwhelmed and not having

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:84%
the tools and having a
downward spiral sometimes?

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:90%
I know I've been there.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the catalyst is
just a spiritual awakening,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:84%
where there's this journey
of moving forward and healing

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and moving into a
new phase of life.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But then feeling
stuck and pulled back

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:84%
to old habits, old beliefs,
and unhealthy cycles that

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
keep repeating over and
over and over, again.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And a struggle with
that transformation

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:90%
into a new way of living.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, part of
your specific work

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
is dealing with
deep core wounds.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.432 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain for our
viewers what a core wound is?

00:08:54.432 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Thank you for that.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think, all of us one of
the things we have in common

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
are some core wounds
where maybe in childhood,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
or young adulthood, or even
in adulthood where we felt

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:90%
rejected.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Where we felt unloved.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Where we weren't embraced.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe oppressed
or not allowed

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.460 align:middle line:90%
to be our authentic selves.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's
from the abandonment

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
of a parent, or maybe emotional
unavailability, or some trauma

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
physically,
emotionally, sexually,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:84%
mentally, or
energetically that we

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:90%
were on the receiving end of.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
core wound happens,

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.250 align:middle line:90%
where we didn't see it coming.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know
what was happening.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where
the initial pain happens

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:90%
that says I'm not enough.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not lovable.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worthy.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong with me.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's the core pain.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes on
top of that, there's

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
a secondary wound that says
when this core wound happened,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to express
about it because there wasn't

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:90%
a safe place for me to express.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:19.088 align:middle line:84%
Or my emotions were shamed from
family members or from society.

00:10:19.088 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Or I wasn't allowed
to speak about it

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:90%
when I expressed about it.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
My voice was stifled or
my expression oppressed.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And so then there's a
secondary wound on top of that,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not allowed to feel.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you share with us the
mechanism between the deep core

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
wound and then this surface
of life living dysfunction?

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Yes.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is
the mechanism here

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that makes it necessary to
go to these deep core spaces?

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I ask is that
many of our viewers are like,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to feel the pain.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Thanks very much,
I'm doing fine.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.492 align:middle line:84%
And as long as I stay out
running it, I'll be just fine.

00:10:55.492 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:84%
However, we know that we
get down the road far enough

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and things catch up with us
and it doesn't work that way.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So can you just
share the connection

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:90%
to connect those dots?

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Because
we don't outrun it.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:84%
The cycles keep repeating
in our past, if unresolved,

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:84%
becomes our future
over and over again.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we can have the illusion
that we're out running it.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So then there's
this third wounding

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that happens that in the
betrayal and the denial

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
of going into the
deep, then there's

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
all of these other set
of circumstances that

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:90%
come when I'm oppressing it.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
We might have had
that core wound

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
from an experience of somebody
else and now this time

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
around, it's suppressing
that says, hey,

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to feel it.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to deal with it.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
oppressing our own feelings

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:90%
and our own truth.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes
addiction, depression,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
additional consequences.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when we keep
experiencing these cycles over

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and over again, it's the
invitation of our soul

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the
original wound.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Because as it repeats
over and over again,

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:84%
the cycles and the
patterns raise the stakes.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it gives us the power
to rewrite our story and rise

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:90%
above it.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.315 align:middle line:84%
And not be held
captive by it anymore.

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Which, I think, is truly
where the liberation

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and the empowerment
comes and the freedom

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
to write this next
chapter of life

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:84%
with greater tools of
awareness and empowerment.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's almost like there's
this purpose on a soulful level

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that we have these wounds to
begin with that ultimately,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
if we allow this moment where
a wounding was occurring

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and then the secondary wounding
on top of that is occurring,

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually
an invitation for us

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
to grow into who we
came here to become.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:90%
To awaken to our true self.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:90%
The wound isn't a bad thing.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And the happening of
it isn't a bad thing,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
even though it might have been
confusing or difficult. Yes?

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: I feel that
it's a classroom,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:90%
the wounding is a classroom.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And our soul has
created a classroom

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that is providing us with the
opportunity to heal and awaken.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And so there isn't any
wound, I believe, that we

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:90%
aren't capable of healing.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the classroom, we get
to look back and say well,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
what did I learn from that
trauma, from that experience?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Although, as
traumatizing as it may be

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and I want to honor
how challenging

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that is and I want bring
compassion and that's

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
where the compassion and that's
where the angel comes in.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And we are not defined or
confined by that trauma.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:90%
We can be free of it.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are pearls
when we have the courage

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:84%
to go look at it and discover
what is there for me,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
then we can take the
lesson that gives us

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.440 align:middle line:84%
the power, the insight, the
perspective to rise above it

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:90%
and make different choices.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we can
almost look forward

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
to digging in because our power
is underneath that very thing.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:84%
That which we are missing is
right underneath this wounded

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:90%
compacted aspect of ourselves.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Yes, and a lot
of times what we are here

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to do as a soul, there are
tools, there are treasures,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
there are gifts locked
in those traumas

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and in those
challenges of our past

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to need
for our soul's mission.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Even if it was 10 years ago, 20
years ago, or four decades ago,

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:84%
or many lifetimes ago,
our soul's path in order

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to move forward will
need those tools.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's always this, I've
got to go back and unlock

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that treasure to follow
my soul's mission

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
to have that tool, that
gift, that perspective that's

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:90%
going to help me serve others.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Or it's going to give me a
perspective, or an insight,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.810 align:middle line:84%
or an intelligence that I need
from my soul's mission right

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:84%
They're connected,
they're linked to.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, people
would never realize

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
that it's just a chain reaction
that's just keeps happening.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of chain
reaction, speak to us

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:90%
about ancestral karma.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
What is the chain that's
unfolding and rolling

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.290 align:middle line:90%
forward here?

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Well, as kids, we take
on so much from our parents.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And if we're involved
in evolution--

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:84%
which I get excited about this
because I feel that we're here

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:90%
to participate in evolution.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we're here to
participate in evolution, then

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that means what our parents gave
us or our grandparents gave us,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
which might be
wonderful values, there

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
might be a lot of positive
things in there for the viewers

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and for all of us.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:84%
When we mine the treasures that
we received from our ancestors.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And there also might
have been just,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, maybe, some
unconscious patterns.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Some let's put it
under the carpet,

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:90%
let's not talk about it.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not
dealing with emotions,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:84%
then they come out in rage,
or passive aggressive,

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:90%
or addictions.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we might have
taken on as that

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
was modeled for us to blame,
to ignore, to get aggressive,

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.520 align:middle line:84%
to not take accountability,
to stuff emotions.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we are not bound by
the choices of our parents,

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:84%
or our grandparents,
or our ancestors.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
We might have been
modeled by it.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:84%
We might have been
exposed to it.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:84%
We might have been
deeply imprinted by it.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:90%
But we are not limited by it.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to evolve beyond it.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Look at its unconsciousness,
bless it with gratitude,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm going to
make a different choice.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Hard to do.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Hard to do, sometimes.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Yeah, hi.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.547 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's hard
to do, sometimes.

00:16:38.547 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to
respect our parents.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Our parents were our gods.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.345 align:middle line:90%
They knew everything.

00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:90%
They were everything to us.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when the natural
evolution is taking place

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
through us, it's a
little hard because we

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:90%
don't want to outshine.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to go further.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And we want to belong
and to be proud of us.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And to be connected in this way.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So how do we break
these patterns?

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
These karmic,
ancestral patterns,

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.615 align:middle line:84%
how do we break them with grace
and allow ourselves to shine?

00:17:08.615 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: And this is
where it takes courage.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the
social responsibility

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to evolve beyond what
our parents gave us.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's stand on their shoulders.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's receive the
wonderful traditions,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:84%
the qualities they
modeled that were

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:90%
spot on that we want to take.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And give ourselves permission
to evolve beyond your father.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
What a wonderful influence that
he opened the door for you.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And you have the responsibility
to take that and evolve

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:90%
beyond it.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:90%
To add to it.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And so that gives
us permission to not

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:84%
be the little girl,
the little boy that

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
just is underneath the shadow
of our parents positively

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:90%
or negatively.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I might need to come
out of the saddle of my father's

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:90%
addiction or his aggression.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:10%
I might need to come out of
the saddle of my mother's

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:10%
bipolar or her oppressing her
emotions or her insecurity.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:10%
So we also want to
evolve beyond our parents

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:10%
shadow and their light
and give ourselves

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.950 align:middle line:10%
permission to learn
from their intelligence

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:10%
and also from their
unconsciousness.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:84%
To learn from their wounding,
as well as their courage.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's evolution.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And the process of that is being
aware that I'm an individual.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm individual.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I am separate
from, influenced by

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:37.033 align:middle line:84%
and shaped by, but still an
individual soul on my own path.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think because
our bloodline,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
we feel guilt and obligation
to do it their way.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And part of
individuation, which is

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:84%
happening in the third chakra,
is saying I am an individual.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And I may have different
beliefs, some same,

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
but I also have the freedom
to have my own beliefs.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And I have the necessity
to walk my own path.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Take what they gave
me and add to it

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and follow my own
soul's intuition.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.942 align:middle line:84%
Which, I think, is
exciting and liberating.

00:19:05.942 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Doesn't have to be
either or, black and white,

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:90%
all or nothing.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Yes.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And let's take
what we gave them,

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:84%
let's take what they gave
us and let's add to it.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.105 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So I have
a quick question

00:19:15.105 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
then I want to go into
your shamangelic healing.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:middle line:84%
How often do you
find that people

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
that come to you actually
living into the very shadow side

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:90%
of their parents unknowingly?

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Just, like, the thing
they didn't like the most,

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
they're actually doing
it right in front of you.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.060 align:middle line:90%
IS this a common?

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: So often--

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.238 align:middle line:84%
I laugh hysterically because
we don't want to say oh,

00:19:38.238 --> 00:19:40.655 align:middle line:84%
you sound like your father or
your sound like your mother.

00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the worst.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.133 align:middle line:90%
Don't ever say that.

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:90%
You're like, no, you're right.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And that cringing that
through all of that influence

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and all of that modeling, that
we sound like our parents.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.038 align:middle line:90%
In good ways, yes, sometimes.

00:19:55.038 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:84%
We model good things and
we're saying yes, that's

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:90%
a positive thing to say.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And other times, so
often, we've taken

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
those other than excellent,
unconscious qualities

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:84%
because they were modeled
and socially reinforced.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:90%
And we can break those patterns.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the sessions
that I do, that's

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:84%
one of the things we bring to
light is to acknowledge hey,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
this is one of those
unconscious patterns

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that we took from father,
or mother, or caregiver

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have to keep.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:90%
We can upgrade it.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:90%
We can upgrade it.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we are not bound

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
by my alcoholic tendencies,
or aggression, or blame.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:90%
We're not bound by that.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And it takes awareness and
a willingness to evolve.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
But it takes the awareness
first to say, hey,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
do I want to pass
this onto my kids?

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get to
pass those bloodline, karmic

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
patterns that says, hey, just
because this was modeled--

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed that
when as a parent,

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I start astounded
sounding like my dad.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:90%
In many ways, that was great.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:90%
In other ways, I was like oh.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to pass on some
of those things to my kids.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:90%
And I had to be accountable.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I had to be aware.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And I also had to
be courageously

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
committed to breaking
those patterns

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and learn some new ones
so that I could pass

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:90%
something else onto my kids.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: That's it.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what we have to share
in consciousness today is

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that hey, this is
not a big deal.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're here to do.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We're here to reach in
there, grab this stuff,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
open it up, here it up,
bring conscious to it,

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and move on and evolve.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: But the
silver lining is

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:84%
the depth of the relationship
now that I have with myself,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and that I got to experience
in the later years with my dad,

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and then with my
children has changed

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
so much what I took from my
parents and now passed on.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.687 align:middle line:84%
And they'll take
and improve it, too.

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:90%
They'll improve on--

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: They'll be like,
can you believe mom?

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:90%
That was crazy.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Oh, my gosh, right?

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:90%
7.0, go ahead.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Improve, go right ahead.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So tell us about
your unique approach

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:90%
with shamangelic healing.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Oh, well,
the shamangelic--

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:84%
because when I was having
my shamanic journeys where

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this deep, old,
yucky, gooey, heavy, dark stuff

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been holding for
a long time was released,

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of traumatic
to have that all come up.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought what was
missing was the tenderness.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And so in my healing
practice, what I've added

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:84%
is that tenderness,
that compassion,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that gentleness
that holds a space.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And so shamangelic
healing is this blending

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:90%
of the feminine nurturing.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Honoring where we're wounded.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, the facing the
fears and let's get radically

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:84%
honest about hey,
that's not yours,

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:84%
or that doesn't fit
who you're becoming,

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
or you don't have to
hold that any longer.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
That is able to be the truth
teller and call it out.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And find this beautiful,
delicious balance

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine and
the masculine, the fire

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and the water, and
the groundedness

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and the spirituality
and blend it.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And that has been such a
deeply beautiful experience

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:84%
to hold space for clients,
couples, individuals,

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and groups of people to have
radical transformation that

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
are dealing with
core life shifts

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and helping them to
turn their life around,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:90%
reclaim their power.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And stand in who they are
and create a thriving life.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And then turn around and
find their soul's mission

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and make an impact
on other people.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.910 align:middle line:90%
That lights me up.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, indeed.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So the combination
is so important.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I was in the depths of
the villages in India

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.810 align:middle line:84%
with a great scrub down and
it was anything, but gentle.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:90%
It was like, you get this.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I can so
appreciate what you're

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.860 align:middle line:84%
saying about this need for the
combination of this compassion

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and this great clarification
all at the same time.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Scrub down with a fluffy towel.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: We need both.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:84%
We need inspiration
and we need honesty.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:90%
We need courage.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.380 align:middle line:90%
We need a nudge.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:90%
We need a tender embrace.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So specific
modalities that you're

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.737 align:middle line:84%
doing to provide this
for people, what is that?

00:24:25.737 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Wonderful.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So my signature--
there's two sessions

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:90%
that I really love to offer.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And the signature
one-on-one session

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.920 align:middle line:84%
is called My Shamangelic
Healing Journey

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's a
two-hour experience.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And the first part of
that is holding space,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:90%
like we're doing today.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And to really just hold
space for the story,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:90%
for the wounding.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And in that space, I get to
sit in this place of seeing

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:90%
where the energy is leaking.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Where the story's disempowering.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:84%
My guides are working to
show me different things.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And I get to
uncover and discover

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:84%
who this person is
underneath it all.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I get shown very clearly
where the core wounds are.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Where the disempowerment is.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And so in that first part
of the session is discovery.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:84%
There might be a
perspective shift.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:84%
There might be
counseling in there.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
uncovering and the holding.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Then the second
part of the session

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
is going into the
healing room and that's

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:90%
where the real magic happens.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And in that space, we
might do a regression.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
We might do a combination
of sound healing, touch,

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:90%
holding space.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We might have a deep
cathartic release.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:84%
We might bring in
a spiritual guide.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.595 align:middle line:84%
We might go into
our future selves.

00:25:45.595 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:90%
It's never the same.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:84%
My guides work with
me and whoever's

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:90%
on the table and their guides.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe an ancestor or a loved
one will come in for the journey

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and I get to have this
nice, big medicine

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:84%
bag of sound
healing, breath work,

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:84%
guided visualization,
working with guides,

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:90%
hands-on touch, essential oils.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And I get to orchestrate and
be a part of a tailored journey

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
that is deeply soulful
and empowering that

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:84%
goes deep, gently, powerfully to
guide people through a journey.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And it is delicious.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:90%
It's always new.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I never know what's
going to happen

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.960 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a conduit for
whatever is coming through.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And each journey
is new, and unique,

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and tailored in the moment
for the person's healing

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and awakening.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And what is the
end goal of the session?

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
When you-- I know you don't know
the route it's going to take,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.668 align:middle line:90%
but what's the end game there?

00:26:44.668 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: They
remember who they are.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
They feel and
reconnect to the part

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:84%
of their authentic power,
their divine light,

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.820 align:middle line:90%
their internal truth.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
They get to come home to that
place before the wounding,

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.170 align:middle line:84%
before the layers of limiting
beliefs, and programming,

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:90%
and oppression.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:84%
They get to come back to that
place of True North, again.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Which is so beautiful
to see the shift when

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
they come in to the session with
the wounding, and the layers,

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:84%
in the walls, and
the limitations.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's
dissolved, when they're open,

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:84%
when they're in this
place of authenticity,

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I get to see the sparkle
return to their eyes.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I get to see the truth and
their authentic emotion return

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:90%
to their face, into their body.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:90%
They remember who they are.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
beautiful opportunity

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:90%
to witness that transformation.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And reflect that back to them
to say that's who you are.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel that?

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's just such an
honor to hold space

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:84%
for that much transformation
in such a short period of time.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:50.805 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.805 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What about
sustainability?

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.355 align:middle line:90%
Do they integrate?

00:27:54.355 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:84%
How do you facilitate
integration of that experience?

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Yes, I think the
awakening is the first part

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and then we have
to learn the tools.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Because we can
remember, but then

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:84%
we're going to still go back
to these limiting beliefs.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:10.978 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where my
online coaching comes in.

00:28:10.978 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:84%
To say, hey, let's
make sure you have

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:90%
the tools to help you remember.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And are using visualizations,
and you're using affirmations.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And that you're learning
conscious communication.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.490 align:middle line:84%
That you're learning spiritual
connection with meditations.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:84%
That you're learning
empowerment tools.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it's important that
people have daily practices.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:84%
That they have communities of
support to keep them on track

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's like
a log by the fire.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
That when we pull it away,
without that inspiration,

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
without that support
of community,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:84%
we forget and we go back
to our old patterns.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm big on integration
with programs, online programs,

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:84%
personal coaching, retreats,
and different approaches

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:84%
to help them stay
in that inspiration

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and stay in the
awakening process.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: As a healer, what
skills do you rely on the most

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:90%
to allow this to be effective?

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: This is one that not
any of my teachers or trainers

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
ever taught me and
it's the sacred heart.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The ability to provide
unconditional love

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.220 align:middle line:84%
in a situation for
whatever is happening

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:84%
is a tool none of my teachers
really taught me how to do.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the Anahata, Anahata
is the heart chakra,

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:84%
it's that opportunity
that that's

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
healing modality

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:43.793 align:middle line:84%
is to be in the heart space
with whatever is happening.

00:29:43.793 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Whether that's an addiction.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Whether that is blame.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Whether that's a cancer.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's my
most powerful healing modality

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and the others are intuition,
compassion, presence.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And trusting and listening to
what my guides are telling me

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.310 align:middle line:90%
and what my heart is.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom of my sacred
heart, that that's

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:06.610 align:middle line:90%
the most powerful thing.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, I have
the whole medicine bag

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:84%
of different tools
that I can pull out

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that intuitively will
match what the person is

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.420 align:middle line:90%
needing in that moment.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But by far, the
heart and intuition

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.800 align:middle line:84%
are the most powerful
healing gifts.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.720 align:middle line:84%
You've mentioned your
guides a couple of times.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Can you say more
about that dynamic?

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Yeah,
it's nice to know

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.190 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not alone in this.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not me, it's us.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I feel that there's
ideas, there's

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.040 align:middle line:84%
information,
there's perspectives

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.157 align:middle line:84%
that come in that I
would have never done,

00:30:44.157 --> 00:30:45.490 align:middle line:90%
that I would have never guessed.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
started trusting

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:84%
that was when I was starting
doing card readings.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:84%
At the very, very beginning,
almost two decades ago

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and I started
doing card readings

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and my clairvoyance
started turning on,

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:90%
my ability to see things.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.700 align:middle line:84%
My ability to hear
things, clear audience.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.067 align:middle line:84%
My ability to sense
things, clear sentence.

00:31:03.067 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It all started coming
on and I didn't really

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.800 align:middle line:90%
know how to use those skills.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
to trust those.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And a teacher that I was
working with at the time

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:90%
was like, trust it.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Don't doubt it.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't block it.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't argue with it.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Just allow it to come in.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I would do that and
just allow it and trust it,

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
the most profound
things that would

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:84%
be happening in the readings
because I would see something.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.345 align:middle line:84%
I would see someone's
guide standing behind them.

00:31:31.345 --> 00:31:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And instead of shutting it off,
doubting it, and oppressing it,

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.978 align:middle line:84%
I was like what if I actually
just brought that guide

00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
doing and what they were

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:90%
saying into the experience?

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I have an
alliance of support, of wisdom,

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.120 align:middle line:84%
of guidance that I can
access at any moment that

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
is always right, it's
always smarter than me,

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.660 align:middle line:84%
it's always wiser, and
has an intelligence

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.730 align:middle line:84%
to read the situation and
land exactly what's needed.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I've learned
to collaborate

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.600 align:middle line:84%
humbly and gratefully with my
guides and spiritual counsel.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:90%
It comes in many forms.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do you see that these
guides are around everyone?

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:84%
That everyone has this
separate sense of support?

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: Yes, I believe that
they're around everybody.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Whether they sense it or
not is up to the individual.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.242 align:middle line:90%
Whether they have that blocked.

00:32:27.242 --> 00:32:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Whether their beliefs don't
allow them to access that.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether they think if somebody's
passed, that they're gone,

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have
access to them anymore.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And my personal experiences
as I keep growing and learning

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.140 align:middle line:84%
is saying that that's
actually false there.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.390 align:middle line:84%
They're there all
the time, it's just

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:84%
whether or not our channels are
receptive enough to receive it.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.910 align:middle line:84%
There can be guides
in many forms.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned
that humbly, I'll

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:90%
take all the support I can get.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a mountain,
an animal spirit guide,

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to
receive any guidance

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I can get, as long as
it's for my highest good

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and it helps the situation.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.093 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's all one thing.

00:33:02.093 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all just consciousness.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're tapping into higher
and higher realms of it.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And the higher the realm we
tap into, the greater capacity

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:84%
we have to heal
ourselves and to unpack

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:84%
these core aspects
of our being that

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.230 align:middle line:90%
have been behind the blinders.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: It feels nice
to not be all alone.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And I feel because
on our journey,

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
we are alone, in
many ways, because we

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:90%
have to take the steps.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have our human
family to help us with that.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And to know that there's
unconditional love

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and guidance that can be
really valuable and honest.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And nudging, inviting
you to awaken it

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:90%
and step into my power more.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't always like
what I'm hearing.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.510 align:middle line:90%
It scares me.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It excites me.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.085 align:middle line:90%
It makes me nervous.

00:33:51.085 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it's always spot on.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
level of comfort

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:84%
that I receive in knowing that
I'm not on this journey alone.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.242 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can a client
have a profound shift

00:34:01.242 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:90%
in just one session with you?

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: 100%.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:84%
The other session
that's really valuable

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:90%
is the breath work session.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.699 align:middle line:84%
And in that, I
think, that's where

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I can work with many,
many clients at once.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And the shamangelic breath
work really does go deep.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We can have a lot of
cathartic emotional release.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.904 align:middle line:84%
And in that, a lot
of nurturing support.

00:34:24.904 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And bringing in those higher
frequencies of the angelic rims

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or higher self,
we can bring that

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.170 align:middle line:84%
in all in one session, quite a
lot in a short period of time.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:84%
So not only the
one-on-one session

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.117 align:middle line:84%
of the shamangelic
healing journey,

00:34:40.117 --> 00:34:42.110 align:middle line:84%
but shamangelic
breath work takes it

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.600 align:middle line:90%
to another level of depth.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And that can happen
with families.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:84%
That can happen with
whole groups of people.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I just did a retreat
a couple weeks

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:57.110 align:middle line:84%
back where I had a whole
team of other support people

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.440 align:middle line:84%
that we did a whole shamangelic
breath worked for 50 people

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.310 align:middle line:84%
at a time, together doing
this emotional releasing

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual expanse.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:90%
It was just profound.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you share
with us an example of one

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.820 align:middle line:84%
of these profound experiences
that you've facilitated.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: So
shamangelic breath work

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:22.070 align:middle line:84%
looks like you're laying down
and it's this deep breathing.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Just deep inhales and exhales.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're allowing the breath
to be the shaman that it is.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And invite it down
into the basement where

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.300 align:middle line:84%
things have been stuffed
under the carpet,

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:90%
there in the corner.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And we ignore them allow them
to come up and to be released.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
process, people are

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:45.110 align:middle line:84%
able to release pain from past
lifetimes, trauma, and abuse.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And face their fears with this
combination of angelic support

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and the shamanic
courage to say, hey, you

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
don't have to hold
that any longer.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:84%
With drumming, with rattles,
with encouraging words,

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.317 align:middle line:84%
we might have a
lot of fire and we

00:36:04.317 --> 00:36:06.650 align:middle line:84%
might have a lot of water,
which would be a lot of tears

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of sadness.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And to hold somebody
in their sobbing

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and to bring that delicious
compassionate Mother Mary

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:84%
energy and to hold
someone in their sobbing

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:90%
is just such an honor.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And also to help them
with clearing out density

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that they've been holding
from their bloodline,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:84%
from their past that is holding
them back is so liberating

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.710 align:middle line:90%
and an honor to hold space for.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And people come out,
like, all shiny.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I've been holding
that for a long time.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know my first
one, rage came out.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And other times,
I've been rolled over

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.310 align:middle line:84%
in a little ball like a little
baby just crying and crying.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And not about any one
particular issue, but all of it.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sue, just all of
the disappointments

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
sadness and the loss.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And having a safe space
for it to be expressed

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and honored and not
shamed or repressed.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

Anahata leads a healing
retreat called The Empowerment

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.000 align:middle line:90%
and Awakening Weekend.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Here's what some
of the participants

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.025 align:middle line:84%
had to say about
their experiences.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:17.825 --> 00:37:18.625 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:18.625 --> 00:37:20.300 align:middle line:90%
- I've gained deep insights.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:10%
I can see things through
different perspectives.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm gaining more
confidence in myself.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm becoming more aware of some
of the things I do really well.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.640 align:middle line:10%
- The Empowerment and Awakening
was incredibly beneficial.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.490 align:middle line:10%
I learned so much on how
to be a better human.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:42.800 align:middle line:10%
How to-- a great description
for it is being a human 101.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:84%
It really teaches
you just so much.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Stuff that they should
teach you in school.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:10%
- Like, there's a whole
different part of me

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:56.270 align:middle line:10%
that's opened up that I never
realized I had access to.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And that part of me is
actually, the invitation

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.050 align:middle line:84%
for spirit and other
resources to come through me.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.250 align:middle line:90%
To make me stronger.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.090 align:middle line:90%
To make me more--

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:84%
to shine brighter in
the world, really.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The reason that I ultimately
chose to work with her

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:90%
is because of her integrity.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:90%
And she does what she says.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And she takes a
stand for what she

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:90%
believes in and is unwavering.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:90%
[PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Lot of joy.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: It is.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.553 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Lot of shine.

00:38:31.553 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: I just, I want to
inspire millions to shine.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And just dissolving all of
these core wounds and limitation

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.320 align:middle line:90%
beliefs.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Because underneath
it all, we all

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.250 align:middle line:84%
have this power to rise, and
serve, and shine, and make

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:84%
a positive impact, and leave
this planet and humanity better

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:50.820 align:middle line:90%
than we found it.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.620 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: My mother
used to say that.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Is that right?

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Leave it better
than you found it.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Anyplace you go, leave it
better than you found it.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.238 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: That's improvement.

00:38:56.238 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So tell us about--

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I teach a lot of breath
work, as well, in the courses

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:01.560 align:middle line:90%
that I teach around the world.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd like to just share
with the audience, because I

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.730 align:middle line:84%
know that it's
extraordinarily valuable,

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:84%
breath work, the mechanisms
of the shamangelic breathing

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.770 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.518 align:middle line:84%
Shamanic breath is
this deep inhale,

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:15.560 align:middle line:90%
exhale through the mouth.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just coming in, really
animating and oxygenating

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:19.190 align:middle line:90%
the blood.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And allowing us to activate
deep core wisdom centers.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share
with us the mechanism

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:28.690 align:middle line:84%
that you feel that does to help
produce the outcomes that we

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.220 align:middle line:84%
just saw in these
people's faces?

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:90%


00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: We're going after
what is blocking our light.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's emotion,
a limitation, a heaviness.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I think the
breathing is so intelligent.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Now there's Yogic
breathing, where we're

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.700 align:middle line:90%
breathing in the upper centers.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Coming up in here.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: And we're
awakening up here.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And shamanic or
what I like to do,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.920 align:middle line:84%
shamangelic breath work is
let's go down here first

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.220 align:middle line:84%
so that we can clear
out what's in the way.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we make room to
breathe into the upper centers,

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:07.610 align:middle line:90%
into the heart.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.652 align:middle line:90%
And we can bring in love.

00:40:08.652 --> 00:40:10.210 align:middle line:90%
We can breathe in truth.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
We can breathe in
peace, grace, healing.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:90%
But let's go down--

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of it as
an infinity loop-- let's

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:84%
go down into the basement
and like a broom,

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.060 align:middle line:84%
clean out what's
down there first.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And then let's allow the breath
to open the upper centers

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and open into this
unlimited possibilities.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're, of course,
hyper-oxygenating the body

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're clearing
out physical toxicity.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But we're also clearing
out energetic and emotional

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.140 align:middle line:84%
toxicity that is in the
way of our truest essence.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And then in the journey that
I like to take people on,

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:90%
we go down into the deep places.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:84%
There's the shaman, let's
go take a look at it.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, we go through
these different waves

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:84%
where we open into, what
are we putting in its place?

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we let go of that
density, then what light,

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.200 align:middle line:84%
what love, what truth
can we bring in?

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And so then there's
this opportunity

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.840 align:middle line:90%
to open, to feel, to receive.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's this whole journey.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And the shamangelic
aspect is I'm deeply

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:15.130 align:middle line:84%
holding space right
there, one-on-one involved

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:16.300 align:middle line:90%
with people's journey.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Supporting them with
whatever modality

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.760 align:middle line:84%
will help them move the
energy out or move it in,

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.960 align:middle line:84%
depending on where they
are on their journey.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.180 align:middle line:84%
It might be taking tears
of pain that have risen

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and allowing it to be placed
on their heart for healing.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Or celebrate with them.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:37.330 align:middle line:10%
Or help them to release
this anger or rage

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:10%
where it has been blocked
here around their throat.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's in the moment,
intuitively reading each person

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and deeply weaving
into their journey

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and helping to accelerate
the depth of it.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about your podcast
and how people can contact you.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: Oh, wonderful.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, the Shamangelic
Healing Podcast,

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:02.140 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to have
a larger platform

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.760 align:middle line:10%
to inspire millions to shine.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Shamangelic
Podcast is that.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:12.040 align:middle line:84%
There's conversations like
this about consciousness,

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.730 align:middle line:84%
about meditation, about
core wounds, codependency,

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:19.510 align:middle line:84%
vibrant health, and
relationships, and traumas.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's a full range of
resources, all the way up

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:28.180 align:middle line:84%
the chakras and down and
different real life experiences

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:90%
that are available.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Conversations with
great experts,

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.260 align:middle line:84%
like you, that have wisdom
to bring to the table

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.440 align:middle line:90%
and share with the audience.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And so Shamangelic
Healing Podcast

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.590 align:middle line:90%
is on all of those platforms.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And then Anahata Ananda is--

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the social media
for Anahata Ananda.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And shamangelichealing.com
is where I am in Sedona.

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just here to help people
through these core life shifts

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.280 align:middle line:90%
and reclaim their power.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Turn their life around and
create a thriving life.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And make a difference
because we're all here

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:03.207 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And if we get all that
other stuff out of the way,

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.780 align:middle line:84%
we can get to the business
of leaving this planet

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and humanity better
than we found it.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You're certainly
playing your part.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ANANDA: It's fun.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:18.400 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing can be a
blast, to serve from the heart.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Well, thank you so
much for being with us today

and to bring this
to our viewers.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:29.310 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

you for paving the way

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and being a wave shower.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And this platform is really
impacting so many people.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.840 align:middle line:84%
That we have alternative
platforms for consciousness

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.240 align:middle line:84%
reaching such international
audiences so thank you.

>>SUE: Yes, we want to bridge
science and spirituality

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.788 align:middle line:84%
and just open it up
to land for everyone.

00:43:48.788 --> 00:43:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ANANDA: We have so many
tools that our parents didn't

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and so we get to do
something with that.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, we get to honor it.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:90%

>>SUE: Anahata Ananda is
testament to just how powerful

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:84%
it is to work with
a healer who can

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:03.100 align:middle line:84%
bring about true
change on a soul level.
