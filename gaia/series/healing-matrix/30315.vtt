00:00:21.603 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We've
all heard about the benefit

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:84%
in cooperating as
a team, whether it

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:84%
be in a relationship, at
work, with friends or family.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:84%
For some of us, it's more a
spiritual, abstract notion.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.350 align:middle line:84%
While in truth, the benefits
can be scientifically mapped

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jeffrey Fannin
has been working

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:10%
with brain mapping
for more than a decade

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:10%
for the purpose of understanding
states of consciousness

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:10%
that engage whole-brain states.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.490 align:middle line:10%
Not only is he proving
that whole-brain states are

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:10%
the pathway to intuitive
connection with self and those

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:10%
beyond, he's proving
that consideration,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:10%
positive feedback,
and cooperation

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:10%
are essential to repairing
ourselves and our societies.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:10%
You're about to see your brain
in living color in these higher

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:10%
states of function.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a lot of
these images already.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:10%
Not only are they beautiful
to see ourselves in this way,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:10%
but it's also very
graphic to see

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:10%
what we do to
ourselves with various,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:10%
say, less beneficial
brain states.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And before we get into
all that, first, we

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:10%
interviewed Rob Williams.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:90%
The two of you work together.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And we talked there
about PSYCH-K,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and how we can change
our internal subconscious

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
beliefs so that we have a chance
of really patterning ourselves

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:90%
in a new way.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:10%
And where that story leaves
off is where your work comes in

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:10%
because you started
documenting and mapping

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.172 align:middle line:10%
what this actually means to us.

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:10%
>>JEFFERY FANNIN: I really
didn't imagine that that's

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:10%
what I would be doing.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:10%
It kind of happened a
little bit by accident.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.610 align:middle line:10%
When we met, I was actually
setting up somebody

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:10%
to do brain mapping,
and teaching them.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:10%
And they were telling me about
this whole thing of PSYCH-K.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.018 align:middle line:10%
And I had never
heard of that before.

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, if
it's brainwave energy,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:10%
we should be able to somehow map
that and do something with it.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:10%
So, because I had done a lot
of brain mapping on myself,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:10%
I knew what my brain
map looked like.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:10%
So we did a pre and a post.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:10%
And in between the
pre and post maps,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:10%
we did what's called an
optimal health balance.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:10%
And so once we processed
it, and I looked at it,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:10%
and I was shocked--

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:10%
I mean literally shocked.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.932 align:middle line:84%
It was like brains in my
world, they don't do this.

00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:90%
What is this all about?

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
change that rapidly.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: They don't change--

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't see
shifts that rapidly.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FANNIN: It was in a
space of about 40 minutes.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent three
days actually trying

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:90%
to explain it away.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:10%
That's the scientist in me that
said, OK, it had to be the cap,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:10%
it had to be the equipment,
it had to be something.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.628 align:middle line:10%
But I couldn't explain it away.

00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:55.420 align:middle line:10%
And then I began to
think about, all right,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:10%
if I can't explain it away,
and we've got a real phenomenon

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:10%
here, then what is it?

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.862 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I
began to break it down,

00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:10%
and looking at the
different frequencies.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean?

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:10%
And is this some sort of a
message for me to understand?

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:10%
And as I began to
understand that,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:10%
then that's when I got
Rob's number and called him.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:10%
And it was like finding
my long-lost brother.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.715 align:middle line:10%
Instant connection,
just right there.

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:25.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that's what
he had with Bruce Lipton.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:10%
And now the three of you
are working together.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.218 align:middle line:10%
The funny thing is,
our birthdays are all

00:03:30.218 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:10%
five days apart.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What time of the year?

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: Libras.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're all Libras?

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: Yeah.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, amazing.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, looking for balance
all the time, right?

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.352 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: [CHUCKLES] That's it.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:10%
The whole brain
state in balance.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, he decided, after
we had talked a few times,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:10%
to come down to my clinic
in Glendale, Arizona.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:10%
And we would start
looking at this.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:10%
We had no idea where to go.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:10%
There was no roadmap for
this, because you can't just

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:10%
go out and look at the
scientific literature,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:10%
and this guy did this, and
Dr. So-and-So did that.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:10%
There is no roadmap.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:10%
You're creating them.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah, we're
creating the roadmap.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:10%
And so it was definitely
new territory.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:10%
There are ancillary pieces
of science and information

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:10%
that are available to us.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:10%
But we sat down, and then began
to just say, all right, well,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:10%
let's just kind of let spirit
guide us in this process.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Which
is, I have to say,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.037 align:middle line:10%
that's big, in and of
itself, for a neuroscientist.

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's not where
most guys go when they're

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:10%
embarking upon a new study.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: That's true.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:10%
That's true.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:10%
It's very difficult
for a scientist who's

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:10%
grounded in science to then
say, all right, let's do some--

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:10%
but I was always that way.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:10%
Human behavior
was something that

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:10%
was very interesting to me.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:10%
And so I was formerly an airline
pilot in one of my careers.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, when
it started to wind down

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and they were having layoffs
and things in the airlines,

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that's when I
decided, well, I think

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll go back and get
my PhD in psychology.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:10%
Because human interest
was so fascinating to me.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to know, why do we
do the things that we do?

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:10%
And how do we become what
it is that we become?

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:10%
And why can two people in
the same family, one go one

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:10%
direction, and one go another?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:10%
And that was all very
fascinating to me.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:10%
I just needed to know.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why
I needed to know.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:10%
But I would do a lot of things--

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:10%
my wife can tell you this.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:10%
I would be working
out in the yard.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:10%
And I'm listening to audiobooks.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm a big fan of audiobooks.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:10%
I listen to a lot of them.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:10%
And she would say, what
are you listening to?

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm listening to
this thing about Einstein

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:10%
and E equals mc-squared.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:10%
And she'd just kind of roll her
eyes back and say, whatever.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:10%
But there was this hunger
for that knowledge.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:10%
And little did I know
that it was preparing me,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:10%
as all of my careers
have actually prepared

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:10%
me, to do what I do now.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:10%
So when we started off
doing those recordings,

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:10%
in over a year,
we did 125 cases.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:10%
This was the basis
of the research

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:10%
and the scientific papers
that we wanted to write.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:10%
And the thing that
we wanted to do

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:10%
was look at, if this
was a real phenomena,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:10%
how is it that we could
measure some of these somewhat

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:10%
intangible kinds of things.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:10%
And because I was part
of, previously, a research

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:10%
team at Arizona
State University,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:10%
we were looking at
neuroscience, and leadership,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:10%
and we did a number of
trips to West Point,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:10%
and we were looking at
complexity of thinking

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of
things like that.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:10%
So that training
helped me understand

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:10%
how to do research on very
nebulous kinds of things.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:10%
So I had the tools with the
EEG, and also breaking it

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.457 align:middle line:10%
down into what we
call quantitative EEG.

00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was going
to ask you about that.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean, QEG?

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah, QEG
is a quantitative

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:10%
electroencephalogram.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:10%
And what it does is-- it's
kind of like the weather map

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:10%
that you see, where they
have colored gradiations

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.998 align:middle line:10%
of different temperatures.

00:07:08.998 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
same kind of thing,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
where you have different
colors of different frequencies

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:10%
So as human beings,
we basically function

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:10%
within these delta, theta,
alpha, beta, high-beta, gamma.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:10%
And that's kind of the range
that we mostly look at,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:10%
until we start looking at
higher levels of consciousness

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.472 align:middle line:10%
and things like that
that go beyond that,

00:07:33.472 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:10%
and other types of energy
and functions in the brain.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so just going
in there for a moment, when

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:10%
you start getting into the
higher states of functioning,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:10%
and getting into gamma,
you're looking at people

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:10%
like practicing
meditators, Buddhist monks,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:10%
and that sort of thing, right?

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Exactly.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:10%
One of the fun things that
I've done over the years

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:10%
is I like the idea
of how psychics work.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:10%
And I've got quite a
collection of people

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:10%
who do psychic, and channeling,
and things like that,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:10%
that propose to have gifts.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted to know, how
did they use their brains

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:10%
differently than maybe we do.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:10%
And so we've been
kind of exploring

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:10%
some of that, which
led us to some

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:10%
of the other parts of research.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:10%
But in the clinic we
use the brain mapping.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:10%
Because we work with a
lot of ADD, and anxiety,

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:10%
and depression, and things
that people struggle with.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:10%
And brain mapping
helps us identify that.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:10%
So there are certain
patterns in the brain that

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:10%
help us identify those things
like the ADD and so on.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:10%
And so from that,
we were able to look

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:10%
at leadership in the same way--

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:10%
are there patterns in the
brain that makes a good leader?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:10%
And we were able to look at
different types of leaders--

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.485 align:middle line:10%
the visionary leader, and
the transformational leader--

00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The
dictatorial leader?

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: The
Machiavellian leader--

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.258 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: --and all of those.

00:08:57.258 --> 00:08:59.600 align:middle line:10%
And we looked at those
in different elements.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:10%
And so the brain mapping
helped us understand that.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:10%
And then there were other
parts of the brain mapping

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:10%
that's called joint time
frequency analysis, that--

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:10%
I know, I'll try and keep it--

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.735 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Don't say those words.

00:09:13.735 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: [CHUCKLES]

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Just tell
us what that means.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: What that means is,
if there is a burst of energy

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:10%
in the brain for a
particular reason--

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:10%
if we are looking at courage,
when a person is courageous,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:10%
or when they are
hopeful, or when

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:10%
they are being
resilient or deceptive,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:10%
there is an element
of the brain that

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:10%
fires to allow that to happen.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you
can identify that.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: Mm-hmm.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you could identify
this person with the EEG--

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.210 align:middle line:90%
you put the sensors on.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.792 align:middle line:84%
And then they go through a
series of basic tests, right?

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:10%
And then as you're
looking at that,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:10%
could you look at a person
and see, for example,

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:10%
if they have courage or if they
have a deceptive capability

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:10%
by looking at their brain map?

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: I think
we're closing in

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:10%
on being able to do that with
a great deal of accuracy.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:10%
Right now, all we
have are models.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:10%
So we can say, this is what
the model of a visionary brain

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:10%
looks like, or
somebody who is going

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:10%
to be a good leader,
or somebody who has--

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:10%
for me, it's just like
finding the patterns of what

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:10%
ADD and anxiety look like.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:10%
And so we're now beginning to
diagram other kinds of things,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:10%
like people who have
these extra abilities.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:10%
If you have intuitiveness,
positive and negative thinking,

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.770 align:middle line:10%
part of the brain
mapping when we

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:10%
look at what's called LORETA,
Low Resolution Electromagnetic

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:10%
Tomography, we're able to
determine, for example,

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:10%
in the left-front part
of the brain, when that

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:10%
is consistently lit up,
we know that a person has

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:10%
more positive thinking,
that they are generally

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:10%
a positive thinker.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:10%
And the opposite is true when
the right side lights up,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.320 align:middle line:10%
that they have more
negative thinking.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, the question
from that becomes,

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:10%
if a person thinks
positively or negatively,

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:10%
and that's their dominant
trait, can that be changed?

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And we know that it can.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.432 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
you're learning with Bruce.

00:11:09.432 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:10%
You can see how
it can be changed,

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle line:10%
and you're watching the
direct result of the brain

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:10%
mapping, which is amazing.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: And so the things
that we have learned from Bruce,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:10%
and epigenetic signals
and those kinds of things,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:10%
help us to understand the
effects of our thoughts,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:10%
of our emotions, and how those
all tie together and really

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:10%
allow us-- there is
a definite connection

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.728 align:middle line:10%
between our physical realm
and the spiritual realm.

00:11:37.728 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I
wanted to find out.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I really want
to focus quite a bit on that.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:10%
Because this is an
area where there's

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:10%
been a great rift between
science and the more

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:10%
spiritual modalities, right?

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:10%
I think we can thank Descartes
for starting us down that path.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I think we can, too.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:10%
But the thing is,
your work is really

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:10%
serving as one of
the primary bridges

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:10%
in helping us understand the
reality of what's going on,

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:10%
the physical reality of what's
going on when we're hooking up

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:10%
with whatever it is.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, it's
not just my work.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot that
has gone on before me.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:10%
You look at Albert
Einstein and his work,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:10%
and understanding the
general theory of relativity

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:10%
and how atoms work.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:10%
And then Heisenberg, and
what he began to help us

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:10%
understand in terms
of quantum physics.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:10%
And then David Bohm
comes along and gives us

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:10%
some more insight that there
are certain cortical structures

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:10%
that the EEG--

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:10%
and I went, oh, yeah,
well that makes sense,

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:10%
and then started
looking at it from what

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:10%
fires and doesn't fire.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But you
have the pictures.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: I have the pictures.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.435 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:12:46.435 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:10%
This is really a critical piece
for us, for the layperson.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: As far as I
know, I'm the first person

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:10%
to come along--
and this is where

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Rob kind of turned my life
upside down and drug me

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:10%
out of doing the kinds
of work that I was doing.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:10%
But I got to tell you, it is
the most fascinating stuff.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't ask for anything
more challenging or more

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:10%
rewarding than to
be able to do this.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:10%
Because we're talking about--

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:10%
everybody has the
ability to do this.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:10%
It's just a matter
of knowing how.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To do what?

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: To change the
function of your brain.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:10%
We do it all the time anyway--

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:10%
when we learn to
ride a bicycle, when

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:10%
we read a book, when those
neural pathways are developed.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:10%
It's the same thing that
we do in the clinic.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:10%
The brain map helps us
look at if the brain is

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.225 align:middle line:10%
doing too much of something
or too little of something.

00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into some specifics.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I know you have
a lot of imagery.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:10%
Do you have imagery
of people-- as you

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:10%
say, you started working with
people who were intuitive,

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:10%
who were psychics, and
channelers, and so forth.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:10%
What was the dominant
firing up that you saw,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:10%
which portion of the brain?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:10%
And maybe you can give us just
a little tour of the brain,

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:10%
from the frontals,
to the parietals,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:10%
occipitals, and so forth.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, I'll kind of
help you understand what--

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:10%
from that work, being
able to look at that

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:10%
and break that down based
on what I knew at that point

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:10%
helped me to understand, once
we had done the optimal health

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.870 align:middle line:10%
balance, what I was
seeing in those pictures.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:10%
Because in answer
to your question,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:10%
delta is a very prominent part.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:10%
It's like the gateway for
things to happen there.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that's when
we're often falling asleep.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.300 align:middle line:10%
Delta is dominant in
our sleep pattern.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's right, yeah.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: But the interesting
thing, when they did

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:10%
sleep studies, they
also found that there

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:10%
was a presence of gamma.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.965 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, what is
gamma doing in delta--

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:10%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.480 align:middle line:10%


00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: But what we are now
understanding in neuroscience

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:10%
is that is the gateway.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:10%
Let me explain that
just a little bit.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:10%
The thalamus of
the brain is what

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:10%
regulates all the
frequencies-- delta,

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:10%
theta, alpha, beta, all of
those things that we look at.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:10%
So that little almond shape
in the center of the brain

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:10%
is what manufacturers and
regulates those frequencies.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:10%
And so by doing that there,
I wanted to understand

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:10%
how does information
from our brain

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:10%
actually get out into the
biofield, if you will,

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:10%
or the quantum field, and how
does information from there

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:10%
get back in to us?

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, at the top of the thalamus
there is a thalamic gate.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:10%
And that gate has a
set of reticular cells

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:10%
that grow in a spiral, up
through the subconscious

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:10%
part of the brain into
the conscious part.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:10%
And it comes out right here.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:10%
And in many cultures, that
is known as the crown chakra.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:10%
Essentially that's our antenna.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:10%
So if we are
generally functioning

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:10%
with frequency information
from 1 to 60 hertz--

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:10%
as human beings, that's
the general avenue

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:10%
that we deal with--

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:10%
well, we now know that
there is subtle energy--

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:10%
and Nikola Tesla was trying
to help us understand that.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:10%
Many people have
seen the pictures

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:10%
of him holding a light bulb, and
it's not hooked up to anything.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
I use that as a demonstration
to show the plasma field

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.760 align:middle line:90%
generation around that.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking
about plasma energy.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:10%
And well, what is plasma energy?

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:10%
So if you take one of
those Tesla generators

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.785 align:middle line:10%
and hold up a CFL bulb to
it without it being hooked

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:10%
to anything, it will light up.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:10%
So it's like, how
does that work?

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's a higher
form of energy.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:10%
So when we're talking
about higher consciousness,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:10%
it's the commingling of that
higher energy with whatever

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:10%
our tuner is dealing with.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:10%
And so there are
two parts to that.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.570 align:middle line:10%
And I call our brain
function that deals

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:10%
with our physiological
and our interaction

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:10%
with the physical world,
that's called resonation.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:10%
So we have elements of
the brain that resonate.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:10%
It vibrates, the
cellular structure.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:10%
And this is what Bruce
talks about a lot in some

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:10%
of his work, and being
able to understand

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:10%
physically what goes on.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:10%
Then oscillation is information
from the field out there.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:10%
So those frequencies then
can get into the brain.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:10%
We can work with them.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So you're
using the analogy

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.873 align:middle line:10%
that the brain essentially
is a tuning device.

00:17:22.873 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Pretty much.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:10%
I mean--

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Transmitter/receiver,
tuning device.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.417 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah, there's
been a debate going on

00:17:27.417 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:10%
for many, many years,
is the mind in here,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.712 align:middle line:10%
or is it out here?

00:17:31.712 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And what is
your opinion on it?

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.587 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, my opinion
after what I've studied--

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:10%
and I can't go back now--

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:10%
is that the brain is
basically a transducer.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:10%
And the energy field is
what we interact with.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:10%
The only question is,
how good is your tuner?

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:10%
And so we see this
in the clinic.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:10%
So when we see anxiety
and depression,

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:10%
that's the resistance.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:10%
We see too much of a
particular frequency going on

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:10%
in the brain.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:10%
And that is a pattern that's
associated with anxiety.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:10%
So can a person
interact with a field

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:10%
more effectively when
that's not happening?

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:10%
Not really.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:10%
The same thing with people
who are more intuitive,

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:10%
that are psychic, who can
move back and forth with time

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:10%
energy, you know, and talk
about the past, the present,

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:10%
the future, those
kinds of things.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:10%
When there is too much
resistance-- here's an example.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:10%
I was working with one
gal who she came in

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:10%
and she claimed to have
some psychic powers.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.008 align:middle line:10%
And so I did a brain map on her.

00:18:35.008 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:10%
And we started looking at that.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:10%
And she had a lot of
posterior beta activity,

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:10%
which is basically anxiety.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.370 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of what we
call hypercoherence.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:10%
The coherence was
all out of whack.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:10%
So we used neurofeedback to
basically tell the brain,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.252 align:middle line:10%
don't do that anymore.

00:18:54.252 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:10%
And it created new
neural pathways.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:10%
So the process for that is
essentially telling the brain,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:10%
see this, do this,
see this, do this.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:10%
And by doing that
over and over again,

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:10%
it causes new dendrites
to form in the brain,

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:10%
new neural pathways to develop.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:10%
And those are the
pathways that then

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:10%
fire rather than the old ones.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:10%
So what happened
with her, as with ADD

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:10%
and anything else,
that got cleared up.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:10%
And she could use her intuitive
abilities much more readily.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.823 align:middle line:10%
She said it was kind of
like coming out of the fog.

00:19:26.823 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't that
what's happening, though,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
with the majority
of the population?

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aren't people
generally, because

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:84%
of the various external
pressures in life,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.840 align:middle line:90%
kind of in this beta overdrive?

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:10%
Or else they've
dropped out entirely,

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.100 align:middle line:10%
or just need to
anesthetize ourselves?

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:10%
And that really
seems to me that is

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.048 align:middle line:10%
what's blocking people's
access to their own intuition.

00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: No question about it.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:10%
From what I've seen
over the years,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:10%
that is definitely the case.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:10%
We get locked up
into what goes on.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:10%
And it's our thought
patterns that really do that.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:10%
So when we look at perception--

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:10%
and I know Rob talks a lot
about changing perception,

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:10%
and so does Bruce.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:10%
Well, what exactly
is perception?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:10%
Perception is
whatever we make it.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:10%
Nothing in life has any
meaning except the meaning

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:10%
that we give it.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:10%
And so if perception
then moves on

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:10%
to become a subconscious
belief pattern,

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:10%
the other side of that
is our thoughts also

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:10%
do the same thing.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:10%
If I have the same thoughts
over and over and over again,

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:10%
it becomes a belief.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, the question is, what is
that charged with in the brain?

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.920 align:middle line:10%
Is a positive thinking?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:10%
Is it negative thinking?

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:10%
Is there some relevance to that?

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:10%
But if I'm dominant with
a particular type of brain

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:10%
frequency, then that
becomes my set point.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.832 align:middle line:10%
So if I worry all the time--

00:20:43.832 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:10%
and this is one of the
things we try to measure

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:10%
is, like, 32 different emotions.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:10%
So joy and contentment have
a whole different frequency

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:10%
to them than despair
and worry and anger.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:10%
So let's take a real
quick example of that.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:10%
Let's suppose I'm
driving down the highway.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:10%
And somebody cuts me off in
traffic, and I get angry.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, now I'm vibrating this
angry energy, the frequency

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:10%
of where anger is.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:10%
And I go home,
and I tell my wife

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:10%
about this knucklehead that cut
me off, and go to the office,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:10%
and I'm telling
everybody how angry I--

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:10%
well, I'm vibrating
that angry energy.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:10%
And there's a law in
physics that basically

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:10%
says if you continue
to vibrate that energy,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:10%
within 17 seconds, other
energy that is like that

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:10%
will be attracted to it.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to
get more thoughts.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:10%
And our brain says, well, if
you like that negative thought,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:10%
how about this one,
and how about this one?

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:10%
And so let's say that I
go to the grocery store,

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:10%
and I'm still thinking about
all these angry thoughts.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.992 align:middle line:10%
And I get in line, and I've got
three items I want to pay for.

00:21:49.992 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:10%
But there's somebody
in front of me

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:10%
that they have 38 items
in the express line--

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:10%
something to get angry about.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.855 align:middle line:10%
And then the cash register
is not working properly.

00:22:01.855 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:10%
And the person running the cash
register, it's their first day.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:10%
So we begin to
attract those things--

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Those circumstances.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: --those circumstances.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's
self-perpetuating.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Right.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And people talk about
self-fulfilling prophecies.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:90%
This is how it works.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:10%
We now understand,
from the neuroscience,

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:10%
exactly how and why it works.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But if you're looking
at it from that perspective,

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:10%
then, and you start to look
at the ramifications of it,

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:10%
isn't the actual processing
speed of our brain

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:10%
and other mechanisms
affected, then, by that?

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FANNIN: Well, I don't know
if it's the processing speed.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:10%
There are two
parts that process.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:10%
The conscious part of
our brain processes

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.680 align:middle line:10%
at 40 bits per second.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:10%
And it kind of is
like the traffic cop

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:10%
that helps decide
what's real, what's not,

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.658 align:middle line:10%
what's going on with me, do I
like this, do I not like this.

00:22:50.658 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now let's
add depression to that.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you're depressed now.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.010 align:middle line:84%
You're angry or, say,
depressed even more so.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.427 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well,
taking depression,

00:22:58.427 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:10%
what we know about depression
is that if I have too--

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:05.020 align:middle line:10%
we want alpha in the back of
the brain, nine to 12 hertz.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:10%
And if I have too much alpha
in the front of the brain,

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to
experience depression.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:10%
So that being out of
alignment is basically

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:10%
what causes those
kinds of things.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:10%
But the subconscious
part of the brain

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:10%
processes at 40 million
bits per second.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:10%
Who wins?

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:10%
And that's where our
subconscious resides,

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.370 align:middle line:10%
that's where our
perceptions reside,

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:10%
and that's where that's the
thalamic gate is that processes

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:10%
from the field into ourselves,
and how our thoughts get out

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:10%
into the field.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, what is it transmitting?

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:10%
Let's say, if I'm
wanting to have

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:10%
more positive associations,
and I'm thinking,

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:10%
well, I want more
positive friends,

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.450 align:middle line:10%
I want more positive
friends, but I'm

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:10%
broadcasting, because of
my subconscious belief,

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm not worthy of
having friends,

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm not worthy of having
friends, or I want more money,

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.040 align:middle line:10%
or I want more this or
that, that's the mechanism.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:10%
The real question is,
what's worth wanting?

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:10%
And so by being able to
break that down and say,

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:10%
getting a core belief
system that helps us

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.118 align:middle line:10%
automatically think, where
we're not having to fight this.

00:24:17.118 --> 00:24:18.910 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's the
direction that we're

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.738 align:middle line:10%
moving with understanding
how these mechanisms work.

00:24:22.738 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:10%
And then it's a
matter of practicing.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:10%
So even though our
parents may have

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.860 align:middle line:10%
done a really rotten
job of bringing us up,

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:10%
and we have all
of those things--

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:10%
that used to really amuse me.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:10%
I would do something
in my life, and then I

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.463 align:middle line:10%
would go, where
did that come from?

00:24:37.463 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:10%
And I'd go home, and
I'd see my parents.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:10%
I'd go, there it is.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: There it is.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:10%
It's subconscious.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:10%
It's embedded in there.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:10%
I have a question.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:10%
Why is it that the
negative energies--

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:10%
which often trauma is negative.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very seldom we
have positive trauma in life.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:10%
So what is it about
the negative that

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:10%
seems to have such mass
to it and take hold

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:10%
so deeply, versus these
sublime positive events that

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.980 align:middle line:10%
happen in our life, which seem
so ephemeral, that with just

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:10%
the tiniest impetus of something
negative, those just-- poof,

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:10%
they tend to go away?

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:10%
What's going on there?

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.837 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, that's
a great question.

00:25:16.837 --> 00:25:17.920 align:middle line:10%
I love that question.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:10%
What happens with--
and first of all,

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:10%
let me start by saying that 75%
of our thoughts are negative.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:10%
And so what happens is,
with that negative thinking,

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:10%
there is a lie out there
that we have to choose.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:10%
So we have to have the contrast.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.655 align:middle line:10%
Without the contrast
there would be no reality.

00:25:34.655 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of the yin
and the yang of things.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:10%
So I've got to have what
I don't want in order

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:10%
to understand what I do want.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:10%
The problem is most of us,
a large majority of us,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.460 align:middle line:10%
tend to automatically focus on
the negative side of things,

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:10%
what will happen.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:10%
And we understand,
from the brain--

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:10%
and this is part of how
the brain is structured.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:10%
There's a part of the
brain called the amygdala.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
our fear detector.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But it also manages most of
our other emotions as well.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:10%
And so when the
amygdala gets fired off,

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.920 align:middle line:10%
it allows us to be safe.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:10%
It's trying to get us
to get out of the way.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:10%
The dinosaur is chasing us.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's pretty
primitive survival stuff.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Right.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.390 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: But it's also linked
to the prefrontal cortex.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:10%
And that's where we make a lot
of our decisions and so forth.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:10%
But when the amygdala gets
fired off over, and over,

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:10%
and over, and over,
pretty soon that becomes

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:10%
part of our set point.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:10%
That becomes part of
our way of thinking.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:10%
We become habituated,
or we are--

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:10%
oftentimes we call it
an amygdala hijacking--

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:10%
that anything seems
like a threat.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:10%
Anything seems like
something to worry about.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:10%
And so when that happens, then
we start looking at life that--

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:10%
what could go wrong?

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And now
this is reinforced--

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.345 align:middle line:10%
I've said this in
many other interviews

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:10%
because it's a reality.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.347 align:middle line:10%
The media at large is
there to reinforce that.

00:27:00.347 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:10%
There seems to be-- if you
want to look at it even

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:10%
as an agenda, to just keep the
negative information rolling,

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:10%
to give a false perception
of how dangerous our world is

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.410 align:middle line:10%
to live in.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:10%
And studies have been done
on this, where, in reality,

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:10%
the world wasn't nearly--

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:10%
the stats were pointing out that
crime had actually gone down,

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:10%
home invasions and different
things, murder rates,

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.320 align:middle line:10%
and yet the anxiety and worry
about them within the given

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:10%
community study was
going up because those

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:10%
are being reinforced
from the outside as well.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.033 align:middle line:10%
And we only have
just a few seconds

00:27:33.033 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:10%
till we take a little break.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.617 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to leave it on
that, and have you come back

00:27:36.617 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:10%
and comment on this
phenomena a little bit more.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.810 align:middle line:10%
So we'll take a quick break
and we'll be right back.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:43.710 align:middle line:10%
OK, we're back.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.127 align:middle line:10%
And we were just
talking about how

00:27:45.127 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:10%
so much of our external
world is reinforcing

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:10%
these negative brain states.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:90%
We're buying into it.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, you say 75% of our thoughts
are negative to begin with.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.330 align:middle line:10%
Before we go into the really
mystical aspect of your work

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:10%
here, let's just wrap that
for a moment, of what it takes

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:07.560 align:middle line:10%
to budge us into a new
vibrational pattern that

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:10%
can start sustaining, and
sustaining, and sustaining

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:10%
positive thoughts.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: I want to
go back to answer

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:10%
the question about the media in
general, why is so much of that

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:10%
negative.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think one of
the reasons they found

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:10%
is because that's what most
people are familiar with.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:30.750 align:middle line:10%
And so it feels normal
to most of the people

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:10%
in the population, if 75% of
our thoughts are negative,

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:10%
and we go down that road--

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Feed it.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: We feed it.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:10%
And so by feeding it,
it's the same thing,

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.890 align:middle line:10%
that we are causing those
things to fire over and over,

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.010 align:middle line:10%
and over.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:10%
And so all it does is
create more of that.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:10%
So when we have a thought--
think about the thought grid.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:10%
Imagine a tic-tac-toe board.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.977 align:middle line:10%
And in the center of that grid
is going to be our thought,

00:28:56.977 --> 00:28:57.810 align:middle line:10%
the central thought.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:00.120 align:middle line:10%
We start having a
negative thought.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:10%
And in 17 seconds, we
have another thought.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:10%
And so that's going to
fill in another square.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:10%
And in 17 more seconds,
we have another thought.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.190 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you keep doing
that for 68 seconds--

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:10%
and there's real mathematics
that go along with that--

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:10%
it creates momentum.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:10%
And that momentum
then puts us on a path

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.950 align:middle line:10%
that that's what we do and
that's what becomes familiar.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.430 align:middle line:10%
So the interesting thing
about that is the opposite

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:10%
is also true.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.050 align:middle line:10%
If I stay in joy,
contentment, happiness,

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:10%
and I choose to have
thoughts like that,

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.170 align:middle line:10%
and utilize a thought
grid in that way,

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:10%
what am I going to get?

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:10%
Same result.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where
meditation, appreciation, all

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:90%
these higher states come in.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: Exactly.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's why--

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:45.563 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Necessary.

00:29:45.563 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: So we're
just using the system,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.060 align:middle line:10%
the laws of the universe,
in order to enact.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:10%
But most people are
just doing it by rote.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:10%
They don't understand
why they're doing it.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:10%
And so now I think we're coming
into an age of awareness,

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:10%
and how do we achieve
higher consciousness,

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:10%
how do we begin to be the
co-creators that we really are.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And we also have
the technology to bear it out.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you're working also
with Konstantin Korotkov's

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:10%
technology that can
show and demonstrate,

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:10%
after a person goes through
the PSYCH-K process,

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.228 align:middle line:10%
you not only have
your acute EEG,

00:30:19.228 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:10%
but you have that to work with.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.978 align:middle line:84%
You have other
technologies to work

00:30:21.978 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:84%
with to prove and reflect back
to ourselves your good work

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.930 align:middle line:90%
has actually paid off.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not just someone's
opinion anymore.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in living color,
which I think is astounding.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:10%
And I want to go into
some of that now.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:10%
You have done some work
with that technology

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:10%
I just mentioned--

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.577 align:middle line:10%
Konstantin's-- having
to do with the aura,

00:30:41.577 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:10%
and watching what has happened
in response to some of the work

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:44.960 align:middle line:10%
you and Rob did.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.990 align:middle line:10%
Can you talk about that?

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:10%
We're getting different ways of
measuring what's going on here.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.470 align:middle line:10%
And Konstantin's work is
exactly that, the ability--

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:10%
it's not Kirlian photography,
it's something totally,

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:10%
totally new, totally
revolutionary,

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:06.300 align:middle line:10%
where it's able to look
at these elements, these--

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.420 align:middle line:10%
and I don't like
using the word, aura,

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:10%
but I think that's what most
people would understand.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:10%
The information that is
coming from around the body

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:10%
and in the body, the
cellular elements of that,

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.010 align:middle line:10%
the vibration, the resonation--

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.110 align:middle line:10%
that's what we're
getting, is the resonation

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:26.297 align:middle line:10%
from the cells in the body, and
able to map that information.

00:31:26.297 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And this is
really quite accurate.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Very accurate.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right
down to the degree

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.280 align:middle line:10%
that an organ is under
or overperforming.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's quite accurate.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.590 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: It is.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.290 align:middle line:10%
And some of the
things that I saw

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:10%
were using a PSYCH-K
balance, where

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:10%
several different
representations, one

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:10%
of those showing what
the organs of the body

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:10%
were doing prior to
a balance, and then

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.470 align:middle line:10%
what happened afterwards.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:54.300 align:middle line:10%
They also have
some representation

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.960 align:middle line:10%
showing the chakras, how they
were completely out of balance,

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.720 align:middle line:10%
and then doing the
PSYCH-K balance,

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.167 align:middle line:10%
actually bringing the
whole brain state in.

00:32:03.167 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:10%
They didn't know that
that's what they were doing,

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.540 align:middle line:10%
but that's what happened.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:10%
The whole brain state appeared,
and it realigned the chakras.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So now you're taking
Konstantin's technology,

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.260 align:middle line:10%
you're applying Rob's
PSYCH-K, and you're

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:10%
watching and
overseeing the mapping

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.230 align:middle line:10%
process that's going on.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:10%
And so we can see
this lineup now

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.550 align:middle line:10%
of the effectiveness of the
PSYCH-K for one practice.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.545 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there are
other modalities too,

00:32:28.545 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:10%
but that just happens to be one
really profound one that you're

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:10%
working with.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.055 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah, and I
think that's the bridge

00:32:34.055 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:10%
between science
and spirituality.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.720 align:middle line:10%
It's not so mystical
and weird anymore.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:10%
By grounding it
in science, we're

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:10%
able to then take a look
at it and say, oh, I

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.390 align:middle line:10%
understand what this is.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's what's
going to help create

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:10%
more mainstream awareness.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:10%
And now there's
another subject that I

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:10%
wanted to get into with you.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.683 align:middle line:10%
And we all are comfortable
speaking-- well,

00:32:59.683 --> 00:33:02.100 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people watching right
now, I think a lot of you--

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.750 align:middle line:10%
and I am very
comfortable speaking

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:07.020 align:middle line:10%
about the notion of being
surrounded with beings

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.640 align:middle line:10%
of different frequencies.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.830 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times we'll
call them our guides,

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:10%
or some people call
them angels, but beings

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.870 align:middle line:10%
that are just beyond
the veil that are here

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:10%
to help us navigate through
because we seem to have

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:10%
lost our own
connection with self,

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.630 align:middle line:10%
to give ourselves our own
guidance, or for whatever

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:10%
reason.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:31.230 align:middle line:10%
But along with that, we're
also as vulnerable to entities

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.960 align:middle line:10%
that might be here just surfing
to do something else entirely

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.760 align:middle line:10%
different.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really
just slightly off phase.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:38.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
other world that we

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:84%
can't see, of frequency,
and beings, and disincarnate

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.720 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.450 align:middle line:10%
I want you to talk a little bit
about what your thoughts have

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:10%
been on this, and what you have
discovered regarding influence

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.670 align:middle line:10%
from the outside from
disembodied beings,

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.290 align:middle line:10%
before we go to your
experiment with Rob.

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:56.130 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: OK, what we
understand about that

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:10%
is that all happens in a
higher frequency range.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.130 align:middle line:10%
When you look at levels
of higher consciousness,

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:06.750 align:middle line:10%
for example, people who have
had Kundalini experiences,

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:10%
it literally changes the tuner.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's where
we're going in terms of being

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:10%
able to manipulate the tuner.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:10%
So you talk about when we
have this negative energy.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:10%
Well, how well does
your tuner dial in?

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:24.449 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like when you
dial to a radio station

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:26.219 align:middle line:10%
and it's not quite
on the station.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:10%
You can still hear it, but you
get the static and so forth.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:10%
And that's when the negative
thinking and such, there

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:39.420 align:middle line:10%
is literally a mathematical
formula that causes--

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.340 align:middle line:10%
it cancels out.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.650 align:middle line:10%
And this is in some of
Bruce Lipton's work, where

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:46.139 align:middle line:10%
he talks about
constructive interference

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:10%
patterns and destructive
interference patterns,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:10%
of when we are in that positive
alignment that that happens,

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:59.940 align:middle line:10%
and then when there is a lack of
what we call phase locking in--

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What
does that mean in--

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, in real terms,
it means if you have two waves,

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:10%
one wave that is coming in from
one direction and meets up with

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.655 align:middle line:10%
another wave, if they
are out of phase--

00:35:14.655 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Meaning
there's no resonance,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:10%
that the resonance isn't there?

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Right.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:10%
What it does is
mathematically cancels out.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:10%
And so that's where some
of the negative element--

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.270 align:middle line:10%
that's what we would call
negative or destructive

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:10%
interference pattern.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:10%
And the constructive
interference pattern,

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:10%
what it does is,
when it's in line,

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:10%
it actually doubles
the amplification.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.940 align:middle line:10%
So if the peak of
the amplitude is 1

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:10%
and the bottom of
the trough is 1,

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:10%
and you match that up
with another frequency

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.830 align:middle line:10%
coming in that is in phase
with that, then it doubles it.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.797 align:middle line:10%
And so we end up with
what's called harmonic--

00:35:53.797 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So that's a positive--

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.640 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: --resonance.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --resonance.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FANNIN: Yeah, it's
a positive resonance.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.088 align:middle line:90%
We call it harmonic resonance.

00:35:59.088 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And we've seen it all the time.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.420 align:middle line:10%
Many people would
remember the commercial

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:10%
with Ella Fitzgerald,
you know, is it

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.935 align:middle line:10%
live or Memorex, and
the glass exploding,

00:36:06.935 --> 00:36:08.390 align:middle line:10%
and that sort of thing.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's harmonic resonance.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:10%
When the amplitude
reaches a certain part,

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:10%
the resonation in those
elements within the glass

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.840 align:middle line:10%
then get to a point
where it's too high

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:10%
and they have to disperse.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:27.650 align:middle line:10%
We use it in medicine all the
time to break up kidney stones.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:10%
Harmonic resonance is
just a focused energy.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.330 align:middle line:10%
Well, we're now
learning how to utilize

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:10%
some of that stuff
with this up here.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:36.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now how
does that work?

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:37.783 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: [CHUCKLES]

00:36:37.783 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now we're
talking higher spectrum

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.250 align:middle line:90%
of the frequency at this point.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: That's right.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Leading toward
more positive states

00:36:43.475 --> 00:36:44.970 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness and experience.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.428 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: One of the things
that was very interesting to me

00:36:47.428 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:10%
as I was reading a
large number of studies

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:56.870 align:middle line:10%
was how is it Qigong masters
can focus their energy in such

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:10%
a way that they can heal cancer
cells in Petri dishes 10,000

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:01.850 align:middle line:10%
miles away?

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.400 align:middle line:10%
How does that work?

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:10%
That was very curious to me.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.427 align:middle line:10%


00:37:05.427 --> 00:37:07.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And Leonard
Laskow did a lot

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.358 align:middle line:10%
of that work out of Berkeley,
I think, with Beverly too.

00:37:09.358 --> 00:37:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were proving that
out in a scientific setting.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: Right.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.810 align:middle line:10%
There's a huge amount of
research over the years

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.330 align:middle line:10%
to help us understand
that that's

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.490 align:middle line:10%
the interaction with the field.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle line:10%
And so it gets back
to this whole notion

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.400 align:middle line:10%
of the brain, the
brain tuner, how well

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.420 align:middle line:10%
is it defined, how well is
it able to function, not

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.360 align:middle line:10%
only within the 0 to
60 hertz, but above.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.940 align:middle line:10%
Higher levels of consciousness--
and so those beings

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:10%
that we can't see, they
function above that range.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:44.810 align:middle line:10%
If we could speed up our
ability to vibrate at that rate,

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.410 align:middle line:10%
we would be able to see them.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:10%
But often we can feel
them, sense them,

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:10%
and communicate with them even
if we can't see them, per se.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: They're able to
slow down that oscillation

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.430 align:middle line:10%
to the point where
it then interacts

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:10%
with our resonation in
our body and our cells,

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.760 align:middle line:10%
and what goes on
in the thalamus.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.650 align:middle line:10%
And that's the
communication that goes on.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:11.060 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now, have
you seen this hooked up

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.740 align:middle line:10%
to the electrodes,
and EEG or QEG?

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: Oh, yes.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you
seen the effects of it?

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.070 align:middle line:84%
What does that look like
when a person has maybe

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
raised their own
frequency enough,

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and others have lowered their
frequency enough to where there

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is this communication
with beings from a higher

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.060 align:middle line:90%
state of vibration?

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: It's the same kind
of thing looking at people who

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:10%
channel and who do the
psychic work and that--

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Pretty much
that's what I'm asking.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: --going back to what
we were talking about earlier.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Is it a
whole-brain state?

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.850 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, yes and no.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.980 align:middle line:10%
It has a property
all of its own.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.160 align:middle line:10%
It seems to start
over here, in delta,

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.440 align:middle line:10%
on the left temporal area.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.760 align:middle line:10%
It moves across the
sensory motor strip,

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.750 align:middle line:10%
over here to the right side,
which is our emotional centers.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.240 align:middle line:10%
But going across that
sensory motor strip,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.270 align:middle line:10%
it allows it to feel in
our consciousness, so

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.150 align:middle line:10%
our sensory motor
strip, our senses.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:05.510 align:middle line:10%
And by affecting whatever
frequencies are there,

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.270 align:middle line:10%
we get the sense of that.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:12.380 align:middle line:10%
And our motor strip, we then
get the feeling for that.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.250 align:middle line:10%
And so that's how some of that
communication takes place.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:10%
I wish we had more time to
talk more deeply about it--

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.070 align:middle line:10%


00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I understand, I just
wanted to brush on it to ask

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:22.850 align:middle line:10%
you, you can actually--

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: We can see it.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:10%
We can measure it.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can measure it.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.080 align:middle line:10%
You can see it.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.815 align:middle line:10%
And also I brought
this up with Rob,

00:39:27.815 --> 00:39:29.330 align:middle line:10%
and I'll bring it up with you.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Patrick Flanagan,
one of his devices

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:10%
he created when he
was a youngster--

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.930 align:middle line:10%
Patrick's thought to be
the reincarnation of Tesla.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.940 align:middle line:10%
And we've done a couple
of interviews with him--

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.148 align:middle line:10%
is that he created something
called a neurophone that

00:39:40.148 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:10%
had the express
function of shortening

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.870 align:middle line:10%
the synapse time
between the right

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.287 align:middle line:10%
and left hemispheres
of the brain.

00:39:46.287 --> 00:39:49.790 align:middle line:10%
And when we were talking a
couple of days ago, off camera,

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.270 align:middle line:10%
you were very piqued by this.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:55.010 align:middle line:10%
Because what I just heard you
say there, this is really key.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.147 align:middle line:10%
Shortening the speed
of communication

00:39:57.147 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:10%
between the right
and left hemispheres

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.493 align:middle line:10%
has to be critical in
achieving whole-brain state.

00:40:02.493 --> 00:40:03.410 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, it is.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:10%
When that time
period slows down,

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.820 align:middle line:10%
the corpus callosum,
there is the transfer

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:10%
of information going from
left and right hemisphere

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:11.600 align:middle line:10%
back and forth.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.600 align:middle line:10%
When we go into
worry, for example,

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.030 align:middle line:10%
when we perceive something as
a threat and our amygdala's

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:10%
fired off, we might
go into worry.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.590 align:middle line:10%
And that's brain's way
of dealing with fear.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.810 align:middle line:10%
And so it kind of
shuts that off.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:29.170 align:middle line:10%
But what it really does is
reduces our productivity,

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:32.093 align:middle line:10%
and we're not able to think
or cognitively function.

00:40:32.093 --> 00:40:34.510 align:middle line:10%
So when we speed that up-- and
that's what the whole brain

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.990 align:middle line:10%
state actually does, it
allows for a faster transfer

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.990 align:middle line:10%
of information through
the corpus callosum.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:43.520 align:middle line:10%
And so when that happens--
so with what you're talking

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.320 align:middle line:10%
about--

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.043 align:middle line:10%
when those connections
are shortened,

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:48.460 align:middle line:10%
and in the whole-brain state--
and this is what we've been

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.660 align:middle line:10%
able to measure--

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.925 align:middle line:10%
that's exactly
what happens there,

00:40:51.925 --> 00:40:55.090 align:middle line:10%
is there is good information
from left and right hemisphere,

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.840 align:middle line:10%
but you also have to have
harmony from front to back.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.020 align:middle line:10%
And that's key in
making all the odds.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, how do you do that?

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I was
just going to say--

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.550 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: You shorted
the connections.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.487 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:04.487 --> 00:41:05.320 align:middle line:10%
It's the same thing.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.840 align:middle line:10%
So the neurophone
device, if it does what--

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.660 align:middle line:10%
well, Patrick, apparently they
couldn't even measure as IQ.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.960 align:middle line:10%
He did it to enhance his own
IQ and to enhance his ability

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.450 align:middle line:10%
to absorb massive
amounts of information

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.070 align:middle line:10%
when he was 13,
when he developed.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.715 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, let me throw
something in from our clinic.

00:41:20.715 --> 00:41:22.090 align:middle line:10%
When we do the
brain mapping, one

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:10%
of the elements
that we can do is

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.590 align:middle line:10%
called predictive
neuropsychological scores, IQ.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:31.390 align:middle line:10%
And so most people don't know
that that's what they're doing.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:10%
So when we're doing a brain
map and we take the readings--

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.970 align:middle line:10%
eyes open, eyes
closed, brain on task--

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:10%
and then we process it, they're
amazed to see what their IQ is.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:10%
It's based on the
Weschler IQ test.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.650 align:middle line:10%
And so what goes on is,
when we had that report,

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.530 align:middle line:10%
it's based on connectivity
within the brain.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.650 align:middle line:10%
And so oftentimes when we
are training the brain--

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.590 align:middle line:10%
let's say that somebody has
an IQ somewhere between 90

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.310 align:middle line:10%
and 105, which would
be considered normal--

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.050 align:middle line:10%
and it can give us a
predictive value based

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.080 align:middle line:10%
on the connections
within the brain,

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.230 align:middle line:10%
and show us what their
brain's potential is doing.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.260 align:middle line:10%
So by retraining
the neural pathways,

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:10%
we see that indicator
or the number go up.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.970 align:middle line:10%
So does the IQ increase?

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:17.110 align:middle line:10%
No, not really.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:20.380 align:middle line:10%
The brain gets more efficient
at dealing with that.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.800 align:middle line:10%
And so what Patrick is
dealing with in terms of that

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.540 align:middle line:10%
is creating the optimal
amount of neural pathways

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.150 align:middle line:10%
to be extremely efficient.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:35.710 align:middle line:10%
We are kind of on the
leading edge of neuroscience,

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.750 align:middle line:10%
but he's way on
the leading edge.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, he's been on the
way leading edge of everything

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.628 align:middle line:10%
for probably lifetimes.

00:42:40.628 --> 00:42:43.960 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: But we're now able
to understand what that means.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.670 align:middle line:10%
And that only means that we're
going to get better at it.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.910 align:middle line:10%
And we're now beginning
to show people how to do.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.440 align:middle line:10%
The technology is there.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.245 align:middle line:10%
We can measure it.

00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:52.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:10%
And we can also,
through technology,

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.430 align:middle line:10%
enhance those states.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.150 align:middle line:10%
And we can, through our
own internal technologies

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:10%
such as PSYCH-K, do that.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.780 align:middle line:10%
Now let's go back
to PSYCH-K. Let's

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:06.820 align:middle line:10%
go to the experiments you
did with a disembodied entity

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.080 align:middle line:10%
of a positive nature.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And this was between
you and Rob Williams.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.418 align:middle line:90%
He used himself as the subject.

00:43:11.418 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah, let me
set that up for you.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:14.772 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:43:14.772 --> 00:43:16.730 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: When we sat
down to try and do this--

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.930 align:middle line:10%
we did this in 2010,
and it's only now

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:23.440 align:middle line:10%
that we're writing some papers
and releasing that information.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:10%
Because the time is right
for that to come out.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.080 align:middle line:10%
And he and I had some
conversations about this--

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.705 align:middle line:10%
you know, "are you going to put
your money where your mouth is"

00:43:30.705 --> 00:43:31.820 align:middle line:10%
kind of thing.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.410 align:middle line:10%
And so we decided, all
right, we can't go back.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:36.910 align:middle line:10%
We have to tell it like it is.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.790 align:middle line:10%
We have to tell the story
the way it really happened.

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.610 align:middle line:10%
But here's what went
down when we recorded it.

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.940 align:middle line:10%
Because we had no idea
what we were going to get.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.200 align:middle line:10%
We hadn't done this before.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.030 align:middle line:10%
Nobody had done this before.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:52.600 align:middle line:10%
And so we did the baseline--
eyes open, eyes closed,

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.490 align:middle line:10%
with Rob, and his
brain on task--

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:10%
recorded that so we would have
something to measure against.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:04.720 align:middle line:10%
And then we sent out a list
of about 10 or 12 recordings

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.770 align:middle line:10%
that we were going to do.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:10%
And there's a process in PSYCH-K
called segregation, which

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.990 align:middle line:10%
allows one higher self to
link up with another as long

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:16.330 align:middle line:10%
as the permission protocols
and things are there.

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:21.130 align:middle line:10%
So Rob's wife, Reyes, was
facilitating, I was recording,

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.110 align:middle line:10%
and then Rob was
actually doing that.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:27.190 align:middle line:10%
So when you think
about it, it wasn't

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:30.040 align:middle line:10%
that it happened, you know,
one day and the next day.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.590 align:middle line:10%
It was five minutes
of recording,

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:36.460 align:middle line:10%
break the segregation,
new permission protocol,

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.810 align:middle line:10%
five minutes of recording.

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:40.000 align:middle line:10%
And we did that with
every single one.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you look at it from
purely an EEG perspective,

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:10%
we're using Rob's
brain, and we're just

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:49.350 align:middle line:10%
recording every five minutes
of what's going on there.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.100 align:middle line:10%
It should all look the
same, shouldn't it?

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Except he's choosing
each time to connect with

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:10%
what--

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.088 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: That's right.

00:44:55.088 --> 00:44:57.633 align:middle line:10%
So what the intention
was-- and we said,

00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:59.050 align:middle line:10%
now, put the
intention out there--

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.120 align:middle line:10%
if this is something
that we are supposed

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.560 align:middle line:10%
to be able to measure, then what
we need is a different energy

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.555 align:middle line:10%
signature from each of
those that we are measuring.

00:45:09.555 --> 00:45:10.930 align:middle line:10%
So I can only
imagine what it was

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:12.820 align:middle line:10%
like on the other side,
where they're going,

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to do this,
well, I want to do this,

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.170 align:middle line:10%
no, no, you can't have
that, I want this.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:10%
So when we processed that,
I mean, I was shocked--

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.383 align:middle line:10%
I mean, totally
shocked, more than I

00:45:23.383 --> 00:45:24.800 align:middle line:10%
think I have ever
been in my life,

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:10%
because that's
exactly what we got.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.930 align:middle line:10%
We got different signatures
for every single one.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:33.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain
who he was calling

00:45:33.405 --> 00:45:34.780 align:middle line:84%
in on the field
of consciousness.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.540 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well,
we wanted to look

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.665 align:middle line:10%
at different consciousness.

00:45:36.665 --> 00:45:39.500 align:middle line:10%
So we looked at Earth
consciousness, Gaia,

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:10%
we looked at Christ
consciousness.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:43.760 align:middle line:10%
We looked at Buddha
consciousness.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.830 align:middle line:10%
We looked at human
consciousness.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.340 align:middle line:10%
And then we also wanted to
look at disincarnate beings.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And Rob tells the story
about what happened--

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right,
Edgar Cayce, Tesla.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Edgar Cayce
and Nikola Tesla.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.717 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'll give
you the other side

00:45:56.717 --> 00:46:00.140 align:middle line:10%
of the story of what happened
to me when I actually hooked up

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.190 align:middle line:10%
with him.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:03.500 align:middle line:10%
So the alpha-theta
training is something

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.260 align:middle line:10%
that we do where we
hook some wires up,

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:09.458 align:middle line:10%
and basically it cycles you
between alpha and theta.

00:46:09.458 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:10%
And it keeps you
from going to sleep,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.710 align:middle line:10%
and keeps you from being awake.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through a
neurofeedback device,

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:14.975 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:14.975 --> 00:46:16.558 align:middle line:84%
>>FANNIN: Neurofeedback
device, right.

00:46:16.558 --> 00:46:21.650 align:middle line:10%
And so it took me two days to
think about whether I really

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.910 align:middle line:10%
wanted to do this, and
what was this all about,

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:25.910 align:middle line:10%
and did I really believe that.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:30.560 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, if you're going
where no man has gone before,

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.120 align:middle line:10%
just do it.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.410 align:middle line:10%
So I did.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:36.333 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting thing
about that is I'm wired up,

00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:37.250 align:middle line:10%
and I'm sitting there.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And after about four or
five-- with my eyes closed,

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:43.525 align:middle line:10%
I'm getting this image of Tesla.

00:46:43.525 --> 00:46:44.900 align:middle line:10%
You know, you see
these pictures,

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:49.190 align:middle line:10%
and he has this kind of very
interesting look in the eyes.

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:10%
The eyes are a dead giveaway.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I saw.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the only time
that I had seen that.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.480 align:middle line:10%
But I knew that
what was going on.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.600 align:middle line:10%
And so his signature
and Cayce's signature

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.000 align:middle line:10%
are similar but very
different, because they

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.350 align:middle line:10%
wanted us to know that.

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.330 align:middle line:10%
And so there are
many beings who are

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.270 align:middle line:10%
trying to help this work come
forward, not just what we're

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:17.840 align:middle line:10%
doing, but with all of humanity,
with all of consciousness

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.472 align:middle line:10%
as we move forward into
this new area of awareness.

00:47:21.472 --> 00:47:23.180 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So you were
pretty much shocked

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.820 align:middle line:10%
to see that there was a
physical representation

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.670 align:middle line:10%
for the difference in
each of those connections

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:29.850 align:middle line:10%
that Rob was making.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.060 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.340 align:middle line:10%
And we've done more
of that in the center.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.910 align:middle line:10%
I'll give you just a real
quick story about this.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:42.440 align:middle line:10%
He had a young man who was
kind of a borderline autistic

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.030 align:middle line:10%
individual.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:48.200 align:middle line:10%
And he hadn't been
doing well in school.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.940 align:middle line:10%
And his mother, who
was a physician,

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.850 align:middle line:10%
she wanted to do some
PSYCH-K with him.

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:55.970 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, gee, I'm
not sure that this is

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.350 align:middle line:10%
going to work out really well.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.900 align:middle line:10%
And kind of put it off, and
put it off, and put it off.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.490 align:middle line:10%
And finally she really
pressed me to do it.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.510 align:middle line:10%
And so I wasn't sure he would be
able to respond appropriately.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:09.260 align:middle line:10%
So we had her stand
in as a surrogate.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.410 align:middle line:10%
So he's in the other room
doing his brain training.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:16.520 align:middle line:10%
And so she was acting
as the surrogate,

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.240 align:middle line:10%
and did some social
skills things with him.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.460 align:middle line:10%
Well, she comes back
three or four days later,

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.560 align:middle line:10%
whenever her next appointment
was, and she says,

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.120 align:middle line:10%
you're not going
to believe this.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.780 align:middle line:10%
She said, he came home
from school the other day

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.543 align:middle line:10%
with some papers
in hand and said,

00:48:32.543 --> 00:48:34.085 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to run
for student council.

00:48:34.085 --> 00:48:35.905 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:48:35.905 --> 00:48:37.640 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: If you
understand anything

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.330 align:middle line:10%
about those kids who
have Asperger's, social

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.190 align:middle line:10%
is not what they do.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.465 align:middle line:90%
But that's what he did.

00:48:44.465 --> 00:48:46.523 align:middle line:84%
And he developed
a whole campaign.

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately he didn't win.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:48.610 align:middle line:90%
But he was very close.

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.940 align:middle line:10%
He got into a runoff, and
only lost by a few votes.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:56.420 align:middle line:10%
But it was something that
he was willing to take on.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.458 align:middle line:10%
And we've got lots
of stories like that.

00:48:58.458 --> 00:49:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I find that
absolutely fascinating.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to say this
part about the surrogate part.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.200 align:middle line:10%
The way Rob does it, where
he's working with kinesiology

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.140 align:middle line:10%
or muscle testing--

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.720 align:middle line:10%
so as a surrogate--

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.020 align:middle line:10%
from what I recall from
years ago with Rob, is

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.530 align:middle line:10%
you would be wanting to
work with, say, my son.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:10%
So through me, my field is
connected with my son's field

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:19.940 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.580 align:middle line:10%
You would be testing,
through my musculature,

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.830 align:middle line:10%
to access the other
person once you've

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:10%
been given permission, on a
soul level, to do that, right?

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: Right.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:31.760 align:middle line:10%
And with the muscle testing,
we would be asking, instead

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.350 align:middle line:10%
of you testing
strong to your name,

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:36.170 align:middle line:10%
you would test strong
to your son's name

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:37.400 align:middle line:10%
and weak to your own name.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Just to give people
an idea of how that works.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:40.748 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Right
that helps validate

00:49:40.748 --> 00:49:42.320 align:middle line:10%
that the segregation is there.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.680 align:middle line:10%
And then you're able to
release it when you're done.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.880 align:middle line:10%
But it works.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.890 align:middle line:10%
And we've measure it.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:48.765 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:48.765 --> 00:49:51.410 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: And we have a
lot of research to go.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:55.310 align:middle line:10%
And we're just scratching the
surface now of what we can do,

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:56.690 align:middle line:10%
what we will do in the future.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:00.660 align:middle line:10%
And we live in an
amazing, exciting time

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.830 align:middle line:10%
where we have not only these
processes and procedures,

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:06.230 align:middle line:10%
but people are hungry for it.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.670 align:middle line:10%
And we have the
technology to help us.

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.900 align:middle line:10%
It's not the technology.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.690 align:middle line:10%
What we need the
technology for is

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:13.880 align:middle line:10%
to help people discover
their own divinity

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.540 align:middle line:10%
and this connection
that goes on,

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.420 align:middle line:10%
and how we can improve
as human beings,

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.510 align:middle line:10%
how we can improve our
performance our ability

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:10%
not only to get this three
pounds of gelatinous stuff

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:33.510 align:middle line:10%
up here tuned up, but also how
to use it more appropriately--

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:34.990 align:middle line:10%
what's worth wanting.

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.610 align:middle line:10%
And also this comes back
to self responsibility.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:42.150 align:middle line:10%
Everything comes back to
self in the end, which is to,

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:45.750 align:middle line:10%
as Rob and I said, you
have to make the choice

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.880 align:middle line:10%
to want to make these
changes through all of this.

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.007 align:middle line:10%
And just to kind of go back
into some of the territory we've

00:50:51.007 --> 00:50:52.590 align:middle line:10%
already been in--
because we've talked

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.140 align:middle line:10%
about a lot of subjects--
we've talked about the aura,

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.890 align:middle line:10%
though you don't like
to call it the aura.

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:58.960 align:middle line:10%
Let's just call it
our living matrix

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:02.370 align:middle line:10%
that's interpenetrating
with the outside matrix,

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:05.170 align:middle line:10%
the field of consciousness.

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:08.100 align:middle line:10%
So if you see yourself
as a being that

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:12.540 align:middle line:10%
has a subconscious which
is interpenetrating

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.340 align:middle line:10%
that field we call the aura--

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.570 align:middle line:10%
it's all contained there--

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:18.630 align:middle line:10%
that the mind, the memory,
is not in the brain,

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.720 align:middle line:10%
but it's also out there,
and that we're simply,

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:25.620 align:middle line:10%
by our decisions and by how
we choose to tune ourselves,

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:29.220 align:middle line:10%
creating the quality of
our life experience--

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.290 align:middle line:10%
and the reason I bring
it up is because when

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:32.790 align:middle line:10%
you did these auric
photographs, you

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:34.830 align:middle line:10%
took someone that
was out of harmony,

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:38.730 align:middle line:10%
you took Rob's program,
and worked with PSYCH-K

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:41.310 align:middle line:10%
to begin tweaking
the subconscious

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:42.630 align:middle line:10%
to take on a new story.

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.430 align:middle line:10%
And then you took the after.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:47.560 align:middle line:10%
There were holes in this energy
field before, perforations--

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.360 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Right.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which can allow
a lot of strange things

00:51:50.485 --> 00:51:52.140 align:middle line:90%
to happen in general.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.030 align:middle line:10%
And it was all smoothed
out, and the holes

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:middle line:10%
had been basically
filled in afterward.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.590 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: And it doesn't take
weeks, or months, or years.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:51:59.850 align:middle line:10%
It happens instantaneously.

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.980 align:middle line:10%
And people are marveled by that.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:06.400 align:middle line:10%
But how long does it take
to change atoms of energy?

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.200 align:middle line:10%
Nanoseconds.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Nanoseconds.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.510 align:middle line:10%
And so our body--

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:11.190 align:middle line:10%
that's another thing
that fascinates me,

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:14.280 align:middle line:10%
is on a cellular level-- if you
look at us on an atomic level,

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.020 align:middle line:10%
the amount of sheer space--

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.510 align:middle line:10%
if we understand the amount
of space that we are,

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.310 align:middle line:10%
we can understand
the speed at which

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:21.630 align:middle line:10%
we can influence it, right?

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.990 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Right.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:23.657 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: In the field
of consciousness.

00:52:23.657 --> 00:52:25.680 align:middle line:10%
OK, now this is all
going into areas

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.733 align:middle line:10%
that you hadn't planned on when
you became a neuroscientist.

00:52:28.733 --> 00:52:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FANNIN: [CHUCKLES]
This is true.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And now you and Rob--

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I want you to talk for a little
bit about how this has been

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:34.740 align:middle line:90%
received in your community.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:38.035 align:middle line:10%
Because usually the people that
are the frontrunners in science

00:52:38.035 --> 00:52:40.410 align:middle line:10%
are the first ones that are
run out of town on the rails.

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:41.210 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.740 align:middle line:10%
Well, when we started
this, we said,

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.360 align:middle line:10%
we have to do the science.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.100 align:middle line:10%
It has to be impeccable.

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.860 align:middle line:10%
Because if we're going to do
this, we have to do it right.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.620 align:middle line:10%
And so we kind of went in
with the philosophy of,

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.080 align:middle line:10%
you may not agree
with our conclusions,

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.750 align:middle line:10%
but show us where
the science is wrong.

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:02.820 align:middle line:10%
And with that basis, and having
an opportunity to do some

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.920 align:middle line:10%
pretty high-level research
and science on some meaningful

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:06.720 align:middle line:10%
things--

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.303 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you can only
imagine the hoops

00:53:08.303 --> 00:53:11.640 align:middle line:10%
we had to jump through just to
get into West Point, to deal--

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.890 align:middle line:10%
and they're now changing the
way they turn out leaders

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:16.510 align:middle line:10%
as a result of what
was learned there.

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:23.760 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, being able
to move into that realm,

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.310 align:middle line:10%
like publishing the papers--

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.388 align:middle line:10%
we published one paper--

00:53:28.388 --> 00:53:30.180 align:middle line:10%
we wanted to write for
different audiences.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.830 align:middle line:10%
We did all of this research
on the whole-brain state

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:33.630 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.340 align:middle line:10%
So we wrote one
paper, and it was

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.860 align:middle line:10%
published for the
psychotherapy community,

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.690 align:middle line:10%
to help them understand
in their language

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:42.210 align:middle line:10%
and their lexicon
of what that means.

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:46.320 align:middle line:10%
We published one just recently
in the "International Journal

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.235 align:middle line:10%
of Management and Business"
to help understand leadership

00:53:50.235 --> 00:53:52.110 align:middle line:10%
management, and business,
and how all of this

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:54.060 align:middle line:10%
fits in that realm.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.220 align:middle line:10%
But the one that was
most nerve-racking for me

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.860 align:middle line:10%
was the publication in
"Neural Connections."

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.340 align:middle line:10%
This was in my own backyard,
of neuroscientists,

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.850 align:middle line:10%
of people that know me.

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.920 align:middle line:10%
They were putting
out a special edition

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.930 align:middle line:10%
of neuroscience and leadership.

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And so they had asked
me to do an article.

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.720 align:middle line:10%
And so I thought, oh, boy, I'm
not sure I want to do this.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.990 align:middle line:10%
Because what I was expecting
is people throwing rocks,

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:10%
push-back, ostracizing me.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.080 align:middle line:10%
And it was just the opposite.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: In your field.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: In my field.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:23.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And your people.

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:24.780 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: And then
people were sending me--

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.310 align:middle line:10%
do you have an article on this?

00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:28.700 align:middle line:10%
And have you heard about that?

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.490 align:middle line:10%
And the push-back that I
thought was going to come,

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:34.960 align:middle line:10%
it hasn't happened
in any of the realms.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.130 align:middle line:10%
Because people are ready,
they're aware, they're hungry.

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:39.450 align:middle line:10%
They want to know more.

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:41.690 align:middle line:10%
And that's what makes
this so exciting.

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:42.490 align:middle line:10%
We are just--

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:42.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No kidding.

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:44.698 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: --living in
an incredible time.

00:54:44.698 --> 00:54:46.050 align:middle line:10%
This is an incredible journey.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.730 align:middle line:10%
And I can't wait
to see what's next.

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:50.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's one of
the most optimistic views

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:51.870 align:middle line:10%
of all of this I've heard.

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:53.640 align:middle line:10%
Because so many
people I interview

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.910 align:middle line:10%
have gone through this brutal
process of being rejected

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.040 align:middle line:10%
by their own profession
because they dared

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.110 align:middle line:10%
go out on a ledge a little bit.

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:03.360 align:middle line:10%
But you've done it, and
you're being embraced

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.940 align:middle line:10%
in one of the areas that is
the most significant, which

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.590 align:middle line:10%
is understanding how
our own brain interfaces

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:10%
with our reality--

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:13.270 align:middle line:10%
in the creation of our reality.

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:14.070 align:middle line:10%
That's amazing.

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:14.910 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Yeah,
well thank goodness

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.870 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have to go
to Copernicus route,

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:18.610 align:middle line:10%
and wait till I
was on my deathbed

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.310 align:middle line:10%
and say, here's the science.

00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:21.110 align:middle line:90%
You deal with it.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:21.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving now.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:23.820 align:middle line:84%
You still have plenty
of time to deal with it.

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.945 align:middle line:90%
We only have a minute left.

00:55:24.945 --> 00:55:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Really quickly, what are
you, and Bruce Lipton,

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.890 align:middle line:90%
and Rob Williams up to now?

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.830 align:middle line:10%
>>FANNIN: Well, we're getting
ready to take a lot of this--

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:35.190 align:middle line:10%
and we call it the
Nature Consultancy--

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:39.780 align:middle line:10%
to show how sustainable
success is so out of balance

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.040 align:middle line:10%
with the principles of nature.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:46.340 align:middle line:10%
And Bruce has written about
this in some amazing ways.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.200 align:middle line:10%
And so we're going to take
this out and show people

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:54.170 align:middle line:10%
the mind-brain-body
science of all of this.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.220 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to be
not just informational,

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.780 align:middle line:10%
but transformational.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:58.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your work.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll probably talk
here again, I'm sure.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FANNIN: I hope so.

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.086 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Regina,
for having me.

00:56:05.086 --> 00:56:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Jeffery.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.710 align:middle line:10%
This has been absolutely
fascinating process

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:09.100 align:middle line:10%
of discovery for me.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.920 align:middle line:10%
I hope it has been
for you as well.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.850 align:middle line:10%
To learn more about
Dr. Fannin's research,

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:15.690 align:middle line:10%
you can go to
enhanceyourbrain.com.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.790 align:middle line:10%
You'll see many
beautiful images of what

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:20.070 align:middle line:10%
our brain looks like in
all these higher states

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.670 align:middle line:10%
that we've discussed today.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:23.610 align:middle line:10%
This should be
enough proof positive

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:25.110 align:middle line:10%
that it's to
everyone's advantage

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:27.720 align:middle line:10%
to spend conscious time
toward balancing our brain

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:31.140 align:middle line:10%
states in whatever the most
effective way is for us.

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:36.090 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thanks for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
