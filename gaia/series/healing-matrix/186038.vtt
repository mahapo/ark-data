>>DR. SUE MORTER: Is it
possible that our brain is not

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the only thinking
organ in our body?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:10%
Why are we often told
to follow our heart?

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:10%
HeartMath, Incorportated
and the HeartMath Institute

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:10%
aim to help people bring
their physical, mental,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:10%
and emotional
systems into balance

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:10%
by connecting the brain
with the intuitive guidance

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:10%
of the heart.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Research shows that when we
shift into a coherent state,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
the heart and brain
operate synergistically,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
like two systems
that mesh into one.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:84%
You can learn how to
activate and sustain

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
this synergy between
the heart and brain

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and prevent stress
producing patterns,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:84%
along with increasing our
mental clarity and discernment

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle line:90%
capacity.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
When we do this, our
creative solutions

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:10%
for personal, social,
and global challenges

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:10%
become more accessible,
providing us

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:10%
with more intuitive
access and flow.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Over the past 20 years,
the Institute of HeartMath

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
has produced coherence
building techniques

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that are intentionally
simple and based

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.350 align:middle line:90%
on scientific research.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Our mission team is
to simplify a process

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
for intuitive connection to
the soul's wisdom and guidance

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:90%
for unfolding who we truly are.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:10%
New research suggests that our
energetic or spiritual heart

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:10%
is an access point for our
natural inner technology,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:10%
the heart's intuitive
intelligence which

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:10%
can elevate our
communications, decisions,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.895 align:middle line:10%
and choices to a much higher
level of effectiveness.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.723 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Deborah,
to "Healing Matrix."

00:02:12.723 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DEBORAH ROZMAN: Thank you.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm so honored to be here.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.462 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Tell us
what HeartMath is.

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Well,
HeartMath was based

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
on a vision of Doc Childre
the founder where he saw

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and anticipated in the
early 70s actually,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
this huge increase
of stress that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
was going to be
happening for humanity.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:10%
And also seeing that the role
of the heart in the human system

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:10%
and that that was the next
level of human evolution,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:10%
was heart-based living.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And what that really
meant that the heart was

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:84%
an intelligent system,
that it actually

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
has connections to the brain,
the body, spirit, if you will,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
that were really important
for us to understand.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we started researching
at the HeartMath Institute,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
we looked at every form of
biofeedback, EEG, galvanic skin

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:90%
response, the EKG data.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:84%
We discovered with a lot of help
from our scientific advisory

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
board to look at the spaces
between the heartbeats measured

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
by heart rate variability.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And in looking at that, we
found that we could actually

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
see changes in the pattern of
the heart rhythm, heart rate

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
variability based
on how we felt.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:10%
So we felt loving, caring,
grateful, appreciative,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:10%
the qualities associated
with the heart, the uplifting

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:10%
qualities, that pattern
became very smooth and ordered

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:10%
and harmonious.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we were frustrated,
stressed, worried, anxious,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.925 align:middle line:84%
that pattern became very
chaotic, very incoherent.

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're going
to talk more about it.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
But what was really
our intention

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
was to create a simple system,
a simple user-friendly system

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
of how people could
learn to distinguish

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
that voice of the heart that
could give them clear guidance

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and direction from all the
other signals, the worried mind,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
the ambition, the emotionalism,
the pulls of the heart.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we know what's really
that true heart talking?

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And be able to create a
simple system based on science

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
that the taxi cab driver, the
yoga master, the Indian chief,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:90%
it didn't matter who, could use.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we also wanted to really
focus on the different conduits

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
to society and how to language
this heart stuff for law

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:84%
enforcement, for the military,
for schools and educators,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%
regardless of their
belief systems,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:90%
for all aspects of society.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
We've been working in
hospitals and health care.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's been an
incredible adventure

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
taking these simple
techniques and then having

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:90%
it peer-reviewed science.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Like, our first
breakthrough which

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
showed the critical link
between our inner state,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
our emotional state, our
consciousness and the heart

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
rate variability or the
rhythms of the heart

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
was published in the "American
Journal of cardiology" in 1995.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So we've been really
focused on peer reviewed

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:84%
mainstream to really reach
a lot of skeptical people

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and help them understand
how they could make

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.277 align:middle line:90%
that shift from head to heart.

00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Why do you think
the awareness of living

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
in heart-based reality
being so important

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
has been elusive to our
culture, our medical culture,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:90%
our scientific communities?

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that?

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it because it's an
invisible connection.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And there weren't
little cables to follow

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to track its
impressive influence

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:90%
on our bodies and our lives.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:90%
What do you have?

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.162 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: No, I think
it's an aspect of you

00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
look at the unfolding
of human evolution.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And all these ancient
cultures east or west,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Greeks, Babylonians,
Egyptians, Chinese,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
all talked about the
heart as the center

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence and wisdom.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And some people practiced
it through their religions

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and moral codes which really
were based upon our heart

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
connection and taking care
of each other and kindness

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and respect for other people.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And then as our intellects
started to develop

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and the research in
the Renaissance times

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
began to separate the
heart and the head.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And it became like everything
was from the neck up

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.108 align:middle line:84%
and the heart was
relegated to a blood pump.

00:06:25.108 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Just to keep us alive
long enough to think more.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.755 align:middle line:90%
>>ROZMAN: Right, exactly.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Or to walk around, right?

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And we forgot that the
heart has more than that.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.488 align:middle line:84%
And that was only in the
1990s, which has been

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:90%
called the decade of the brain.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It's really also the
decade of the heart.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when this new
field of neural cardiology

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
developed where a lot
of the research that

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:84%
had been done 20 years earlier,
but just talking about oh, you,

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
know, the heart has these inputs
to the brain that actually

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.813 align:middle line:90%
tell the brain what to do.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they look,
wait a minute,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
there's four different ways
that the heart independently

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
of the brain
communicates to the body.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and there's 40,000
neurons in the heart that

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:84%
are sensory neurons, a
little brain in the heart.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And this little brain has
neurons that can sense, feel,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:90%
learn, remember.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And guess what, they're telling
the brain pattern matching up

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:90%
here what to do.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what's familiar,
the pattern is here.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
But the heart is
actually giving input

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that can change that
in incredible ways.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn how to go to our
heart, shift our heart rhythms,

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
listen to our heart, we can
change the neural traffic

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:90%
going from heart to brain.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Because of the neural traffic
going between the two,

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:84%
most people think the
brain controls the heart.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:90%
90% is the other way.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It's afferent.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the heart telling
the brain like Morse code

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.708 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in the body.

00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And this is
what has duped us.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we think
that thinking is

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:90%
what drives the whole system.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And as we bring our mind's
attention to our heart,

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
we enhance and magnify
this and turn it

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.162 align:middle line:84%
into a superhighway between
the heart and the head.

00:08:06.162 --> 00:08:07.037 align:middle line:90%
>>ROZMAN: Absolutely.

00:08:07.037 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Because we
know more what to do.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.112 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: And we
get our heart rhythm

00:08:10.112 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
in this harmonious pattern,
that signals the thalamus, which

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:90%
synchronize critical function.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
It signals the
amygdala, which is

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.013 align:middle line:84%
responsible for strong
emotional memory all

00:08:21.013 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:90%
the way to the frontal lobe.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So our higher reasoning
capacity comes

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
in when we're in our
heart, when we're loving.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:90%
When we are caring.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Those aren't just
sweet qualities.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:84%
They are key fuel, or
drivers of the rhythm that

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:90%
illuminates the brain mind.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And so love is important
not just for connection

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and for fulfillment
and feeling, it's

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.202 align:middle line:84%
important for higher
consciousness.

00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's not just what
Hallmark Cards and holidays,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
say, Valentine's Day are
made of, it's so much more.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:90%
So, so much more.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So what does it mean to
activate one's heart?

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Activating
the heart is a choice

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.060 align:middle line:84%
to shift out of here or
strong emotions or reactions

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and actually shift
to the tension here.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And actually almost
all of our techniques

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
start with
heart-focused breathing,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
where you're actually
finding a nice, easy rhythm

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.515 align:middle line:84%
as you imagine your
breath flowing in

00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
through the area of
the heart and out

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:90%
through the area of the heart.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
As you do that, if we had you
hooked up to our heart rhythm

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
monitor, you'd see
the two sides of

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.260 align:middle line:84%
the autonomic nervous
system, parasympathetic

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and synthetic starting to
come into harmonious balance.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And most of our
stress and diseases

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
are created, initiated by
autonomic nervous system

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:90%
disregulation.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:90%
The autonomic nervous system--

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
yoga knows this, that's
all about regulating that--

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for 90% of our
body's involuntary functions,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
from digestion to hormonal
to immune response

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:84%
to how well we sleep
to our stress response.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
If we can go to
our heart and start

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.400 align:middle line:84%
making that shift to activate
heart-focused breathing

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and then activate, choose
a heart quality that

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
allows us to get into that
heart rhythm coherence

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and sustain that harmonious
state so the heart has a chance

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:84%
to tell the brain
everything's cool, open up,

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:90%
that's a self activation.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice to feel grateful.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:90%
It shifts heart rhythm.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:90%
It shifts brain rhythm.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It shifts the autonomic
nervous system.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And it puts you in a
state more connected

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
with your soul,
spirit, who you are.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Beautiful, and we get
to get into some of the details

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:90%
about how that works.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
First, I just want to ask, what
is the mission of HeartMath?

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.085 align:middle line:84%
Big picture, what's
the mission here?

00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: The big
picture is to help

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.028 align:middle line:90%
activate the heart of humanity.

00:10:48.028 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Well, that's a good one.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: And that has
so many implications.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
We see what's happening
in society today.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:90%
It's really old stuff releasing.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's like turning the
paradigm upside down where

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.780 align:middle line:84%
the head and the mind and all
our differences and separations

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:84%
aren't controlling
everything-- and our biases--

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
to where our heart
is more in charge.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And that helps us see
we're all connected.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So the implications
of that helping

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
to activate the
heart of humanity

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
is it helps to bring our
mind, emotions, body, spirit,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.692 align:middle line:84%
into connection with
our intuitive guidance

00:11:25.692 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and our connection
with each other.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.383 align:middle line:84%
We are all connected
in the heart.

00:11:29.383 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: When
everyone's doing that,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:90%
we can see that we're connected.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:90%
We can resonate.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROZMAN: Right, we are.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's measurable.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: We can feel it,
and we can measure it.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's cool.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We know so much about
intelligence and brain biology.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:90%
But what about the heart?

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Does the heart have the capacity
to store thoughts, memories,

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:90%
and emotions too?

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look as Gregg
Braden from "Missing Links"

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
tells us about
memory and the heart.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:10%
>>GREGG BRADEN: This is a story
that happened in a small town

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:10%
in the Midwest.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:10%
It was a story of an
eight-year-old girl

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:10%
who received the heart of
another little girl who

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:10%
was only two years older,
a 10-year-old girl.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And the heart transplant
was successful.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:10%
And typically this
is what happens.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:10%
The doctors will try to match
the heart from the donor

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:10%
to the recipient
within a range of ages

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:10%
so that a very young person
isn't getting the older

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:10%
heart of a very older person.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:10%
So the young girl, she
received the heart.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:10%
The transplant was successful.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.810 align:middle line:10%
But something happened
almost immediately.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:10%
She began having a dream,
a reoccurring dream.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:10%
And it was a bad dream.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:10%
So we will call it a nightmare.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:10%
And she began having
this nightmare

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:10%
over and over and over again.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.030 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't every single night.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:10%
But it was multiple
times a week.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:10%
It was common enough that
her doctor recognized

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:10%
that something
else was going on.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:10%
And it was something that was
out of his realm of expertise.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:10%
So the doctor said,
I've done my job.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:10%
I've given you a new heart.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:10%
It is successful.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, you can go live your life.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:10%
And I think you need
to speak with someone

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:10%
else about the dreams
that you're experiencing.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:10%
So the doctor set her
up with a psychiatrist.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:10%
And the psychiatrist
recognized immediately, this

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:10%
wasn't a typical dream.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:10%
It had the characteristics
of a memory.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:10%
Because the memory of
the girl who was killed

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:10%
was preserved in the
cells of her heart

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:10%
that are now in the body of
the new recipient, the younger

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:10%
girl, and she was able
to share those memories

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:10%
with the authorities.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sharing this story
with you for one reason.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.817 align:middle line:10%
That is how real the
memory is in our hearts.

00:13:45.817 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:10%
It's not a metaphor.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.905 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: This is remarkable.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Well, if you think
about what I said that there's

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
sensory neurons in
the heart called

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:84%
a little brain in the heart
that neuro cardiologists have

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
validated, then those
sensory neurons not

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
only sense and feel that
they learn and remember.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So just like a memory in
your brain is imprinted,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
especially a strong memory like
what this child experienced,

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:90%
the heart retains.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
other books that

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
talk about other case
studies of the same thing.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It usually fades after a
while as the person's own soul

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:90%
and spirit take over.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's been documented
numerous times

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
that a transplant
recipient actually

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:84%
starts to want to eat
what the donor liked.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's not a mystery.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:90%
There's neurons in the heart.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
The fact that our
heart has a brain

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and it functions independent
from this brain but they talk

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:90%
is a paradigm shift.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
That means we need to learn
how to interact with this heart

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.063 align:middle line:84%
brain and what it's
designed to do.

00:15:04.063 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We have known
of course, forever,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:84%
that the heart beats to keep
the body physically alive

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And now we're recognizing
that there are so many more

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:90%
powers of the heart.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you just kind of circle the
wagons here and land it for us?

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
What else is it that
the heart is doing?

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Well, I'm not going
to say that I know everything

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
mystery around the heart.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know and research
is the heart communicates

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.032 align:middle line:84%
with the brain and body
in at least four ways.

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
One way is what we've
been talking about,

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
the neural traffic, the afferent
traffic the signals the heart

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:90%
sends to the brain.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And those signals are largely
transmitted through our heart

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
rate variability, or
heart rhythm pattern,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and the brain pattern matches
from what's familiar to it.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And then it chooses a response.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:84%
We also know of course,
there's a blood pressure wave.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just
beating blood pressure

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:90%
to keep us active.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
There's actually information
in the blood that

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
is informing the brain
and body in terms

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:90%
of the wholeness of the system.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the electromagnetic
field of the heart.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really exciting

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
because think of your heart
like a radio transmitter.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
With every heartbeat, it's
putting out 2.5 watts of power.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And just like a cell phone
tower or a radio transmitter,

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:90%
it is radiating out that energy.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And it can be measured three
to five feet from the body

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:90%
with magnetometers.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.905 align:middle line:84%
But most of us know
and feel that it

00:16:34.905 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:90%
can go a lot farther than that.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And when that heart
beat is radiating,

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
it is also sending
information just

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:84%
like a radio
station, a frequency.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
You tune the dial on
a radio to 101 FM,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and you hear a
different station.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
You talk on your cell phone,
which can go through walls.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic fields
goes through walls,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.370 align:middle line:84%
that's how it picks up the
signal from the cell phone

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%
tower.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
That's how we are picking
up each other's hearts.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And what we feel
is radiated through

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:90%
that electromagnetic field.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
If we feel love, care,
appreciation, kindness,

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
compassion, what have
been called the uplifting

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
qualities of the heart,
the renewing, regenerating

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:84%
qualities, that creates
the program that goes out.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And actually in
our lab, we've been

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:84%
able to see that
that pattern shows up

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
in the brain waves of people
standing three feet away not

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:90%
even touching.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So we are influencing
each other by our vibes.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
kids know that.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:90%
They use that term all the time.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's got bad vibes.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.612 align:middle line:90%
She's got great vibes.

00:17:45.612 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:84%
They're not even
seeing each other.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling it
and picking it up.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the electromagnetic
field of the heart.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
When we're frustrated,
angry, hateful,

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
those are putting out those
very incoherent heart rhythm

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:84%
patterns, stress patterns, those
stress waves are going out.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And we feel that.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
You can walk into a room
where people have been angry.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.975 align:middle line:84%
And they're not talking
and you go, uhh.

00:18:06.975 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What's going on in here?

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: And we're saying, we
can cut the air with a knife,

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can go
into a place where

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.173 align:middle line:84%
people have just been meditating
or having a loving experience.

00:18:17.173 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:90%
And you feel uplifted.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what's been
going on in here.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's in our
language, vibration.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:90%
We feel each other's vibes.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So what can we do to
raise our own vibration

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:90%
and help others raise theirs?

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, the heart
plays a key role in that.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Does the
body or the Earth

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
play a role in
stabilizing our ability

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.435 align:middle line:84%
to trust what's
happening in the heart?

00:18:39.435 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Well, what's
really exciting to me.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.393 align:middle line:84%
And I love this research
that the Global Coherence

00:18:43.393 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Initiative, which is an
initiative of the HeartMath

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Institute has found, is that
the core of the Earth, there

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
is magnetic field emanating
from its iron core,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
it's operating on frequencies
just like the heart is.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And that these frequencies that
are emanating from the Earth's

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.120 align:middle line:84%
magnetic field, the
heart of the Earth,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
overlap human
cardiovascular frequencies.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is that as
the Earth's field is shook up

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
through whatever, that it
can affect our heart rhythm

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:84%
patterns, our health and
our wellness and our peace.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And as the Earth's fields,
as we put out love and care

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:84%
to Mother Earth
and to each other,

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:90%
it's like a feedback loop.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
We are coupling with the Earth's
cardiovascular system, which

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:84%
at 0.1 Hertz is the same
rhythm as a coherent heart

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
rhythm, the same rhythm as
when we're feeling love.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the Earth's
resonant frequency,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:90%
nature's resonant frequency.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And that can amplify
our love and compassion

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:90%
all over this planet.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:10%
So part of our hypothesis is
that as more and more people

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.590 align:middle line:10%
practice heart-based living, as
more and more people practice

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:10%
shifting to the
heart and forgiving,

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:10%
having compassionate latitude,
loving, caring, appreciating,

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:10%
putting out that coherent heart
rhythm, that physics sine wave

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:10%
that it couples with
the Earth's rhythm

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:10%
and creates a virtuous feedback
loop that can really help lift

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.320 align:middle line:10%
the vibration of humanity.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: In your book,
"Heart Intelligence,"

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
you speak about three
types of intuiting.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Well, there's
the non-local intuition

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
we were just talking about
coming from somewhere.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Like. a practical example
that I think many of us

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:84%
have experienced is when you
have a friend you haven't

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:90%
talked to in a long, long time.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And you think about them, and
the phone rings and that's

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:90%
who it is.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
There's something non-local
there that's communicating.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Then there's
energetic sensitivity,

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.070 align:middle line:84%
which is picking up
each other's vibes

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and how in tune we are
to each other's feelings.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
compassion and empathy

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
can help us become more
attuned in a way that

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is more coherent and
centered and poised

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:84%
where we're not taking on
the negativity of somebody

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:84%
else, which is a whole other
topic we could talk about.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
But heart coherence really
helps us lift above that

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and really feel that energetic
attunement in a larger way.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Then there's what's
called implicit memory,

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:90%
implicit intuition.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's like where
you've learned something

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:90%
and it pops back up.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
There's your mind, brain,
heart, synthesize information

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:90%
or experiences you had.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So you get a sense of
intuitive direction.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
kind of intuition

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.022 align:middle line:84%
that most scientists
acknowledges intuition.

00:21:47.022 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's a beautiful
combination of awarenesses.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
say, anyone can do this?

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: We call what anyone
can do, practical intuition,

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:90%
which anybody can do.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And practical intuition
is for example,

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
focusing on your heart,
shifting to your heart,

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
pretending the breath is
flowing in through the heart

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and actually putting out
a coherent heart quality.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, it
opens the vehicle.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It's synchronizes your
heart, brain, nervous system

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:90%
so you can access intuition.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
anybody can do that.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, you might ask, what
would be the most appropriate

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:90%
response in this situation?

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Should I call him,
or should I wait?

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Should I this, or should I that?

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:84%
How do we know of what
things were confused?

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:84%
If we go deep into our
heart and do that technique,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
you can get a clear
inner knowing answer.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:90%
That's practical intuition.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's meant for us to
access that moment-to-moment,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
not just when we're
praying or meditating.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's beautiful.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the more we do that,
moment-to-moment, the more it

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
creates a whole
new neural habit.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:84%
It starts to replace our
triggered stress habits.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It starts to replace
the traumatic memories.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
It starts to heal so that we
really can be more aligned

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and connected with our spirit,
our soul, or who we really are

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and unfold that in
our life day-to-day.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What happens when
we're out of coherence,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:90%
when that's not happening?

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:90%
What happens physiologically?

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:90%
What happens interactively?

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Speak to us.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Well, our normal state
of the autonomic nervous system

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.205 align:middle line:90%
is in no coherent.

00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's not coherent.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.622 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
you raise your arm

00:23:37.622 --> 00:23:40.680 align:middle line:84%
or do what I'm doing here,
the sympathetic nervous system

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:90%
is activated.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there's not going to
be that heart rhythm coherence.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able to
jump up and run or go

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.000 align:middle line:90%
right down to quiet.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Relaxation response is the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The activation whether
we're excited or joyful

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
or feeling great or moving
around is the sympathetic.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But when we're frustrated
or angry or stressed,

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:84%
the sympathetic nervous
system gets overactive.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And we really see a jagged,
irregular, incoherent wave

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The stronger we feel
upset or angry or worried,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:84%
the more it looks
like an earthquake.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And it really is reflecting
how we feel inside.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so amazing to
me about the inner balance.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Or anyway, our heart
rate variability feedback

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
is showing us what is
happening in your heart

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:90%
as you're feeling state changes.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So it mirrors it,
your emotional state.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big wow.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:90%
It certainly was for me.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
When you first see that, you
go, oh, my god, this is real.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.772 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:50.772 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
how the mind needs

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:84%
to see something like this
and then it clicks in.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly makes sense why
heart attacks and these kinds

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:84%
of things are happening when
that disconnection is there.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:90%
It's so.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:90%
So very obvious.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Heart
break, heartache,

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
that electrical energy is
feeding back on the heart

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:90%
because it's in stress.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:10%
And there's so
many lonely people

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:10%
in the world that are
actually in a stress state

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.950 align:middle line:10%
whether it's become habituated.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So they don't even
acknowledge it

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:84%
or feel it anymore, just normal
cut off from their heart.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is, it doesn't
take a lot to reopen the heart.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's the hope.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I find that
when people are

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.088 align:middle line:84%
in this state of
loneliness, and I

00:25:37.088 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
think this is really important
for our viewers to understand,

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that if we are in a
state of loneliness,

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
we just feel disconnected
and that no one gets

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.890 align:middle line:84%
us or understands that
when we bring the mind's

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
attention to the
heart, it automatically

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:90%
eases that sense of aloneness.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a connectivity,
a sense of well-being.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And such an important
initial step

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:84%
for people to realize
that anyone can do that.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Just start dropping into and
paying attention to your heart.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.223 align:middle line:84%
And know you're going to
share some things with us

00:26:05.223 --> 00:26:06.622 align:middle line:90%
about how to.

00:26:06.622 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:84%
How to make sure that we know
that we're getting this done.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: And I have to say,
some people when they shift

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.248 align:middle line:84%
to the heart because it's
been closed off for a while

00:26:13.248 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
feel pain in the area
of the heart or an ache

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:90%
or feel closed down.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
It does take, if
that's your case,

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:84%
just keep self-soothing
as you shift to the heart

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and find something
to feel grateful

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
for, something to appreciate or
feel compassion for yourself,

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:90%
kindness for yourself.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:90%
All that is love energy.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And all that is going to heal
and start to reopen the heart.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
We say I love you
with all my heart.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:90%
You don't say I love you--

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: With all my brain, right.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: And the heart has
that healing power and that love

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
power to do that if we
start using techniques

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:84%
such as the simple
one I'll teach.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, and the helpful
thing is it is measurable.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And you brought
some graphs with you

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:90%
to show us that's happening.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So could you just explain to
us what we're seeing here?

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: All right, so
what you're seeing here

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:84%
is a graph of heart
rate variability.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.490 align:middle line:84%
You can see on the bottom
with the red squiggly lines,

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:90%
that's your EKG.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And with each heartbeat,
your heart rate is changing.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Your heart rate's not 70
or 60 beats per minute.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:90%
That's an average over a minute.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
left side, the Y-axis,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
you can see this person's
heart rate is going within 20

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.820 align:middle line:90%
different points up and down.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But you can see each point
there that's being graphed

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
creates a pattern
overall, over time.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's called the heart's
rhythm, the heart rhythm

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.020 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's a nice start of
a nice sine wave pattern.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, yes.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And then, OK.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: So here what you're
seeing is the emotional state.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:90%
This is the same person.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:04.050 align:middle line:84%
We asked him to recall a
time that he felt stressed.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:10.255 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how jaggedy and
irregular the top graph pattern

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:11.055 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:28:11.055 --> 00:28:12.638 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And this is
being measured how?

00:28:12.638 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: It's through the
heart rate variability.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.680 align:middle line:84%
This is all heart
rate variability.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It's measured through a pulse
sensor that you clip on.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I can even show you.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:90%
I brought one with me.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.908 align:middle line:90%
You clip it onto your earlobe.

00:28:25.908 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:90%
And you turn it on.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And then it has
a smartphone app.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Or we have several different
devices, handheld and computer

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.025 align:middle line:90%
device too.

00:28:38.025 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:90%
And you turn it on.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, it
starts to in real time

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:84%
measure your heart
rate and convert it

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.780 align:middle line:84%
into heart rate variability
and look for how much

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.015 align:middle line:84%
coherence or incoherence and
will display that exact graph.

00:28:52.015 --> 00:28:54.787 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so this person
was hooked up to this.

00:28:54.787 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you asked them to
recall some stressful things.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Yeah, let's go
back to the last graph

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.790 align:middle line:90%
again for a moment.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:05.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then we taught them
the quick coherence technique.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And it took less than
a minute and they

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.680 align:middle line:84%
shifted to the bottom heart
rate, variability heart rhythm

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so beautiful
is the wow that you

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
can go from the top graph
to the bottom graph.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can in
less than a minute.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And the more you practice
this, that shift, the more

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
the coherent pattern
starts to become imprinted.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.660 align:middle line:90%
And you change your baseline.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So it changes your
baseline perception

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:90%
about yourself and life.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And it changes your
stress response.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.645 align:middle line:84%
You're more in
charge of yourself.

00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And the mind and
memory then remembers

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:90%
this as your new baseline.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.498 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:29:44.498 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:90%
This is all I have to be doing.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be doing
this other stuff in my head

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.080 align:middle line:90%
and recreating that.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So then, even when someone is
in an emotionally upsetting

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
situation and it's ongoing,
they can use this practice

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:02.370 align:middle line:84%
underneath this
situation in real time

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and generate coherence
right in the middle

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:90%
of an emotional situation?

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Exactly, and that's
what we teach law enforcement

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.250 align:middle line:90%
police officers to do.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:84%
We teach soldiers to do it
because they need to be poised.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They need to shift out of fear
wherever the situation is.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:84%
How to get into that coherent
rhythm, it's really important.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it takes practice
to actually instate that

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:31.697 align:middle line:84%
as a new pattern, as a
new way of operating.

00:30:31.697 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you're
going to walk around always

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:90%
in bliss or something.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.860 align:middle line:84%
It means you have the ability
to shift and recenter.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Masterly.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROZMAN: Right.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what we see
here is the ability--

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:84%
when you're in that coherent
wave form, what happens

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:84%
is you now have more of what
we call situational awareness.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.005 align:middle line:90%
It expands your perception.

00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this slide
here showing the brain,

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:90%
talk us through this.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Yeah, this is actually
one of my very favorite slides

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:84%
because it just shows
on the left graph you

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:84%
can see a person's
incoherent waveform stressed.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is being communicated
from the heart to the brain

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to the vagus nerve
that goes directly

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.420 align:middle line:84%
to the amygdala, the emotional
memory center, and also

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:90%
another pathway to the thalamus.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And it desynchronizes
brain function

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:84%
so you go into fight/flight,
stress response.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, the amygdala,
it actually can

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:84%
trigger what's familiar
like a fear habit

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
or an anxiety habit
or a stress habit.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go into that
heart rhythm coherent wave form,

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:84%
it's actually sending a
signal to the amygdala that

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.400 align:middle line:84%
can evoke more of
the positive memories

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
or soothe more of the
old familiar habits,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.630 align:middle line:84%
emotional traumas or
the thalamus, which

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:57.112 align:middle line:84%
synchronizes the
brain function all

00:31:57.112 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:90%
the way to the frontal lobes.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.460 align:middle line:84%
That gives you that pause,
that expanded awareness,

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that ability to make
more conscious decisions,

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:90%
more heart intelligent choices.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So that one minute shift, and
you practice it over and over,

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and then stay there longer,
5 minutes, 10 minutes,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:23.400 align:middle line:84%
or as part of meditation, really
re-patterns the whole system.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We are
transmuting machines.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:31.350 align:middle line:84%
We are capable of taking
an incoherent circumstance,

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and our perception of
it, which makes it such,

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and transferring or transmuting
that into coherence.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Exactly,
and the more we

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.480 align:middle line:84%
do that together,
the more it creates

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.020 align:middle line:84%
a collective vibrational
increase making

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.290 align:middle line:90%
it easier for others.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We're in
tune to one another.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So when one of us
finds this state,

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:84%
it has an influence
on the biofield

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
of the next person, the next
person, the next person.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: And the more we
have compassion and care

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and non-judgment for the people
who have different views,

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:84%
or who are in fear or stress,
overload, and polarization

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:84%
from what we might
believe, the more we

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
activate heart coherence
and radiate that to them,

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:20.260 align:middle line:84%
the more it really helps to
release some of that density.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I've learned that
the more aware I am,

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
the more I'm compelled
to shift to the heart

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and actually be kind.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you condone
or agree with someone

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:90%
who's angry or frustrated.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But it means you have this
intelligence that understands

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
based upon their
background and their stress

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and you have compassion.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And that helps actually lifts
or clear the energetic field

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.480 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:90%
It gives a chance.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.958 align:middle line:90%
Love can make a difference.

00:33:52.958 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: A chance for love.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.167 align:middle line:90%
>>ROZMAN: A chance for love.

00:33:55.167 --> 00:33:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: A chance for love,
which is what matters most.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.240 align:middle line:84%
HeartMath has developed
the technology

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.930 align:middle line:84%
that anyone can use to practice
and monitor heart brain

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.790 align:middle line:90%
coherence techniques.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at
the inner balance.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.429 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, let's get ready to
start your first session.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Center the ear sensor
clip to your earlobe.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.679 align:middle line:10%
Then take the inner
balanced Bluetooth sensor

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.860 align:middle line:10%
and attach the larger part by
clipping it to your clothing.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.320 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're using the inner
balance lightening sensor,

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.969 align:middle line:10%
plug it into the lightning port.

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:26.370 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're using the inner
balance Bluetooth sensor,

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:30.389 align:middle line:10%
press the rubber button so that
the blue LED starts flashing.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.510 align:middle line:10%
Once you're ready to start,
just tap the Sessions tab

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:10%
and then hit the Play icon.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.639 align:middle line:10%
If the Play icon is not visible,
tap the center of the screen

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:10%
to make it appear.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.670 align:middle line:10%
Listen to the audio
which will guide you

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.795 align:middle line:10%
through your first session.

00:34:42.795 --> 00:34:45.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd like you to focus
your attention in the area

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:10%
of the heart.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:10%
>> When you end the
session by hitting stop,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.790 align:middle line:10%
you will have the ability
to select your mood.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.730 align:middle line:10%
You will then see the results
of your first session.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.380 align:middle line:10%
Enjoy your first session
and then when done,

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.590 align:middle line:10%
tap the guide section
to find out more

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.450 align:middle line:10%
about the many
features and functions

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:03.442 align:middle line:10%
of your inner balance.

00:35:03.442 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fantastic.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a smartphone.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROZMAN: It really does.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Everyone can do this.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you share a heart/brain
coherence technique with us

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.420 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Sure,
I'll be happy to.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can try this
eyes open, eyes closed.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So the very first step
is shift your focus

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:84%
of attention out of your head
into the area of your heart

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:90%
around the center of your chest.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And just pretend
like your breath

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:84%
is flowing into that
area and out to the area.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:35.460 align:middle line:84%
But the key is keeping your
focus right there, your center

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:90%
being your heart center.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: In the
front and the back?

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.210 align:middle line:90%
All the way through?

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROZMAN: Whatever feels right.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.780 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is not
to be thinking about

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.990 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm doing it right,
but to feel the breath flowing

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.470 align:middle line:84%
into the area of
the heart and out

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:90%
through the area of the heart.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.458 align:middle line:84%
Just find a slow easy
rhythm that's comfortable.

00:35:55.458 --> 00:35:57.750 align:middle line:84%
You want to breathe a little
more deeply, a little more

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:middle line:90%
slowly than normal.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you were hooked
up to the inner balance,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.840 align:middle line:84%
you would immediately see
the rhythm start to change.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So quick coherence is to start
with heart focused breathing.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And let's keep doing it.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:18.360 align:middle line:84%
You want to do that until you
find a nice rhythm, 5, 10,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:90%
breaths or more.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And if people just do
that as soon as they feel

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:84%
triggered, or just do it
for practice 20 times a day,

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:84%
they all start to notice a whole
shift in their life, even just

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.120 align:middle line:90%
doing step 1.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going
to add step two.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So continue
heart-focused breathing.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe in
through the heart area,

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:46.680 align:middle line:84%
feel like you're breathing
in a quality or attitude

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
of appreciation or care
for someone or something

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:57.225 align:middle line:84%
in your life, the
person, time in nature,

00:36:57.225 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
where you really felt that
gratitude or that care,

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the
heart, pretending

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.133 align:middle line:84%
like the breath is flowing in
and out through the heart area.

00:37:08.133 --> 00:37:09.550 align:middle line:84%
You can put your
hand on the heart

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.133 align:middle line:84%
if it helps you keep
your focus there.

00:37:11.133 --> 00:37:14.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And now activate a
feeling that's renewing,

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.160 align:middle line:84%
regenerating like
appreciation or care.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it radiate.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, so beautiful.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And even just this brief
moment of connecting with it.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It seeds this in our audience
to be able to now get this.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Exactly, and if you
have trouble sleeping at night,

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:84%
do this for a few minutes
or as you fall asleep.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you're communicating a
challenging message to a child

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.765 align:middle line:90%
or to a spouse, do this first.

00:37:55.765 --> 00:37:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, thank you.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for sharing that
very, very, very valid

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and important disposition
for people to cultivate.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.570 align:middle line:84%
If we can regulate our
heart/brain coherence,

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.270 align:middle line:84%
what does it mean
if energetically we

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.400 align:middle line:90%
are all connected.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to take a
look at a phenomenon known

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.060 align:middle line:90%
as social coherence.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Our scientists are exploring
how we're all interconnected

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:10%
in the energetic
field environment.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.320 align:middle line:84%
In one independent study, four
people sat around a card table.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Three of them were trained in a
HeartMath coherence technique.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.570 align:middle line:10%
Their heart coherence
was measured

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.360 align:middle line:10%
before and during
the experiments.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.380 align:middle line:10%
What's coherence?

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.730 align:middle line:10%
You ask.

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:42.210 align:middle line:10%
Personal coherence is when
your heart, mind, emotions,

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.910 align:middle line:10%
and physical systems
are operating in sync

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.970 align:middle line:10%
and resonating in
cooperative alignment.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So three of the four
people at the table

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.310 align:middle line:84%
shifted into coherence using
our heart lock-in technique

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.190 align:middle line:84%
while the fourth
person sat quietly.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:middle line:10%
What do you think happened?

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.760 align:middle line:10%
You guessed right.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The fourth person's
heart coherence level

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:06.240 align:middle line:84%
went up too just from being in
that uplifting energetic field.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:10%
That's the power
of interconnection.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:10%
This experiment was
actually done 10 times

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:10%
involving 40 people.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.160 align:middle line:90%
They got the same results.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.942 align:middle line:84%
And the uplifting
effects were confirmed.

00:39:17.942 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you talk about some
of the current research that

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is being done at
HeartMath Institute?

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: Well, the research
we're doing is many fold.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:84%
We are actually looking
at outcome data.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And when people
look at our website,

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.200 align:middle line:90%
they'll see some of that.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.140 align:middle line:84%
There's over 11,000
pre and post in terms

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of how people reduce anxiety,
improve sleep, reduce

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.790 align:middle line:84%
depression and symptoms
that are physical,

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that are a result of those kinds
of incoherent stress habits

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that we can get into so
easily from headaches

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.710 align:middle line:84%
to all sorts of
chronic diseases.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.600 align:middle line:90%
That's on the physical level.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
creative level, we

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.910 align:middle line:84%
see people feeling
more positive outlook,

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.240 align:middle line:84%
being more creative in their
jobs, and being more authentic.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Being more connected
and more motivated.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.170 align:middle line:90%
And so that's exciting.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we take those pre
and post assessments,

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and we share them
with corporations.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:84%
We share them with
health care systems

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.820 align:middle line:84%
who then want to bring
in HeartMath tools

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.448 align:middle line:84%
or get one of their people
certified to actually roll this

00:40:28.448 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:84%
out and teach it within
their organization.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.040 align:middle line:90%
And then we research that.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And then on the global
coherence level,

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.020 align:middle line:84%
we are innovative
of a new app that

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.470 align:middle line:84%
will be able to research
when different individuals

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and groups are all
practicing coherence together

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and see on a global map and be
able to give them notifications

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.930 align:middle line:84%
to practice together and see
how that may be affecting

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:90%
the Earth's fields.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And we've already had
some pretty astounding

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.450 align:middle line:84%
initial results that show our
interconnectivity as we're

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:90%
locked in the heart together.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The Brazilian
skydiving team

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.650 align:middle line:84%
used HeartMath techniques to
coordinate their formation

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.150 align:middle line:84%
into a state of
coherence and flow.

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at
how team coherence

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.350 align:middle line:84%
can optimize performance
in challenging situations.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>> We were 54 people.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And we met to set a new
Brazilian record building

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:90%
a formation during freefall.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And this usually
takes about a week.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So we spend a few days
together making a few attempts.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And all the athletes have all
the skills to actually make

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.190 align:middle line:90%
the record happen.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.900 align:middle line:84%
But in the first couple
of days of attempts,

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:84%
we were not quite getting
together in freefall.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:84%
There was a little bit
of rush and some stress.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And people were not
really getting in sync.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, everybody,
hey, hey, hey, stop.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And then all people look to me.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Come on come on, and everybody
stands in front of me.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I used one technique
that we learned here

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:21.840 align:middle line:84%
with HeartMath which coheres
for five or six minutes.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And then when I felt the
field, the energetic field

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:90%
was kind of quiet.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt, OK,
we are ready to go.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this
or not that jump.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.990 align:middle line:90%
We made it.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> We broke the record.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we broke it.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.320 align:middle line:10%
Amazing.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, and the cool thing
about it is that we could feel

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.170 align:middle line:10%
it in the air, the quietness.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we landed
like a bunch of people,

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.870 align:middle line:84%
they didn't really know
what we were doing.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But they said to us, wow,
we could feel the quietness.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And we were in ease,
in flow in the air.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone was kind
of this low mode.

00:43:07.835 --> 00:43:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's like
a human snowflake.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:90%
It's fabulous.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, what is the Global
Coherence Initiative, Deborah?

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's a
science-based initiative

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to uplift global consciousness
through having individuals

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.790 align:middle line:84%
practice more heart rhythm
coherence and have groups

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.400 align:middle line:84%
practice more heart
rhythm coherence

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and to actually research how
that affects the Earth's fields

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and how the Earth's
fields affect us,

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.810 align:middle line:90%
which they are all the time.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But how we can
consciously, intentionally

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.990 align:middle line:90%
effect the Earth's fields.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:50.535 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of indication
that not only are

00:43:50.535 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:10%
we not all connected,
but we are all

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:58.920 align:middle line:10%
sharing information all
the time and recognizing

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.410 align:middle line:10%
that is happening
through the biofield,

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:03.420 align:middle line:10%
through the Earth's
magnetic fields.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.810 align:middle line:10%
If we can put more coherence
through those information

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:10%
conduits, it can
really potentially lift

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.740 align:middle line:10%
global consciousness and take us
sooner than later towards peace

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.690 align:middle line:10%
and cooperation and harmony.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, it's lifting
the vibration of consciousness

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.760 align:middle line:84%
to receive and
perceive at that level.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.630 align:middle line:84%
That's really what the Global
Coherence Initiative is about.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And then each level on
the research on the heart

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.495 align:middle line:84%
is enabling us to open
up to new possibilities.

00:44:36.495 --> 00:44:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Bringing us back home.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Where can people learn more?

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.896 align:middle line:84%
>>ROZMAN: They can
go to heartmath.com.

00:44:43.896 --> 00:44:47.010 align:middle line:10%
And they can click
on coherence training

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.800 align:middle line:10%
or the different
programs we have

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.350 align:middle line:10%
if they're interested in
becoming a certified coach

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:54.860 align:middle line:10%
or mentor and teaching
HeartMath tools.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
skill set to others.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:59.430 align:middle line:90%
They can learn about that there.

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:02.400 align:middle line:84%
We have an add heart
facilitator product

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that gives them basic
training and then comes

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:84%
with the inner balance
sensor and instructions.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.123 align:middle line:84%
So come help us add
heart to the planet.

00:45:14.123 --> 00:45:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Thank you
so much for being

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.750 align:middle line:84%
with us today and for bringing
your amazing information.

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:22.350 align:middle line:84%
You're teaching us how to
harmonize as an individual,

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to find coherence
as a collective,

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and showing us how
to wake ourselves up

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to a greater truth that is
available to every one of us.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.060 align:middle line:90%
So we are blessed to have you.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.607 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to have you
back on the show sometime.

00:45:36.607 --> 00:45:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROZMAN: I hope to.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.530 align:middle line:90%
But thank you so much.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
leave everybody with--

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.560 align:middle line:84%
given what's going on
in the world right now,

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.250 align:middle line:84%
please have compassion
for yourself.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.080 align:middle line:84%
We're all going
through ups and downs

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.540 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
energetic field.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not just you.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So self-compassion, self-care,
compassion for others

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.850 align:middle line:90%
are very important.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We're learning how to
navigate that with mastery.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
purpose of being here.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Deborah Rozman
and HeartMath team

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.400 align:middle line:84%
are bridging humanity
with science.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:10%
They are passionate about
helping individuals,

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.780 align:middle line:10%
organizations in
the global community

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.330 align:middle line:10%
incorporate the
heart's intelligence

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.150 align:middle line:10%
into their day-to-day
experience to build resilience

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.150 align:middle line:10%
to challenge and to live
healthier, more fulfilling

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.080 align:middle line:10%
lives.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.590 align:middle line:84%
