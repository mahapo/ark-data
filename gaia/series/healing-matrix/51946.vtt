00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
So Patrick, we're

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
at a conference on immortality
here in our beloved home,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Sedona, Arizona.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of different camps

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to immortality.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
You have the notion of the
extreme technological end

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
of transhumanism to
organic life extension

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual overlay,
which is what's the deal,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:90%
we're all immortal anyway.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And so before we get into
the really large issues,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
your piece in it.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things is the human body

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
has the potential to extend its
life very naturally and easily

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
by just adding back
some elements that

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
have been stripped away
from us to begin with.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're, like, the
top guy in the world when

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
it comes to negatively
ionized hydrogen, for one.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's start that part of
the story, how you discovered

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
the notion that we were somehow
missing this in our diets.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go
into the sulfur story.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PATRICK FLANAGAN: Sure.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
intensely interested

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.265 align:middle line:84%
in health, and healing,
and in longevity.

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to live a long
time unless I was healthy.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, who would, I think?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: But I was
severely poisoned as a child

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
with mercury when
I was two years old

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and became autistic until
I was five and a half.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Never spoke a word until
I was five and a half.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.215 align:middle line:84%
And then I got polio
because of what

00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
the mercury did to
me in polio vaccine.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:10%
And they said I'd
never walk again.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:10%
And then I was a
premature baby and spent

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:10%
over two months in an
incubator without human contact

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:10%
when I was born.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't get any
human contact until after.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean any meaningful contact.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You missed all those
chemicals, let's just say,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:90%
in your development.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
All the things that are produced
when we have human contact.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Then you're poisoned by mercury.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Then you end up with polio.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:90%
So you're a very sickly child.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes, and then all
my early years as a child,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I was sick all the
time, sick a lot.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I became
really interested

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
in natural health
practices and started yoga.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It was "Yoga for Americans,"
which I read when I was 11.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And I started doing hatha yoga.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:90%
And it made me feel really good.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With the
polio, was that something

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
that helped you regain
your motor skills?

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: It did, because
I got polio when I was nine

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and they said I'd
never walk again.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I was in leg braces
and crutches.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And I forced myself to
walk through great pain.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.415 align:middle line:84%
And somehow-- I have
a real strong mind.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you do.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: So I
became very interested

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
in health and in natural
health practices.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I started drinking
juices, fresh raw juices

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:90%
when I was 17.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I became a vegan vegetarian
for 30 years, almost 30 years

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:90%
starting at 17.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And was really into learning
all about how to heal the body,

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
because I got good results from
some of these natural practices

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and diets.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
noticed was the tremendous lift

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I got from fresh, raw juices.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:90%
It made me feel really good.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I could fast on
juices for months.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:90%
And they felt so good.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But if the juice wasn't fresh,
if it was half an hour old,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
it didn't do the
same thing for me.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I noticed that.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I actually
will get a stomach ache

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.337 align:middle line:84%
if I drink a juice that
is not within minutes

00:04:45.337 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:90%
having been pressed.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.269 align:middle line:84%
Right away, you got
to slug it all down.

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you say it doesn't
have to do with the enzymes.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Most people would think that
it has to do the enzymes.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:90%
You're saying no.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.549 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: No,
because when people

00:04:57.549 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
said it was the enzymes, well
I just bought a lot of enzymes.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I took all the enzymes
and they didn't do anything.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I discovered
about 1983-- I

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:84%
discovered 1983 to
'84 a special molecule

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
in fresh organic
vegetable and fruit juice

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that is called the hydride
ion, negative ionized hydrogen.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
That's a hydrogen atom
with an extra electron that

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
happens to be at the
exact same potential

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
as the electrons
in the human body.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And the human body operates on
a potential of about one volt,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and those electrons have a
potential of almost one volt.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're the source of
all biological electrons.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So I discovered how to isolate
those and consume them and put

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:84%
them in pills so other
people could take them.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And it changed my
life completely.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been
healthier since.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
be 70 this year.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working on everything
I can to keep healthy,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
at least feeling
young as I grow older.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, but
I've seen something,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
because I've known you
for a lot of years.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Your hair was much grayer
about 10 years ago.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Something's happened.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're reversing the
aging process in your body.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it's
negative ionized hydrogen.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I have a Chinese
partner that sells it.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason he's selling it--
and he came to me because he

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:84%
gave it to his
94-year-old mother, who

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
had pure white long
hair down to her waist.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And after a couple
months on the product,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.270 align:middle line:84%
her hair was coming
up black at the roots.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.155 align:middle line:84%
Her pure white hair
had turned black.

00:06:57.155 --> 00:07:00.582 align:middle line:90%
And he said OK, that's for me.

00:07:00.582 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well
let's talk about it.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
negatively ionized hydrogen

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:84%
in its purest form,
cosmically, the sun,

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
how it interacts,
why you're getting

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
that in your fresh
juices and vegetables,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and then also the degradation
of that same source of fruits

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables for
another reason.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So tell us that
part of the story.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well it
turns out that we

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
talk a lot about the
carbon cycle, right?

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is in the
universe a hydrogen cycle,

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:84%
because the sun and stars
are made mostly of hydrogen.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, 90% of the universe
is hydrogen, 9% is helium,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and the other 1% are
all the other elements

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:90%
that we all know about.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that Chandrasekhar--

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
a physicist from
India, astrophysicist--

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
got the Nobel Prize for
discovering that starlight

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:84%
is produced when hydrogen
on the surface of a star

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
takes on electrons and makes
negative ionized hydrogen

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:90%
called the hydride ion.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And that chemical
process emits light.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then this has
to get into photosynthesis.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Well yeah.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is that light hits

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
the leaves of plants, the
green leaves of plants.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
the plants break down water

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
into negative ionized
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Not just hydrogen and
oxygen, but a lot of it's

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:90%
negatively ionized.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat fresh raw
plants, as our ancestors did--

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:84%
you know, the real cave diet
kind of thing-- if you eat

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
fresh raw food, you're
getting a huge amount

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of negative ionized hydrogen
ions in your body and blood

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:90%
stream.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens when
you juice fresh raw juices.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
This hydrogen is released, which
is the world's most powerful

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:90%
antioxidant.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And it just quickens
the body and gives you

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of energy, but
only for half an hour.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
After half an
hour, that hydrogen

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:90%
is evaporated and gone.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep the juice in
a refrigerator or whatever,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
half an hour later
it's still got enzymes

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:84%
but the hydrogen's gone,
which is the real booster

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.737 align:middle line:90%
energy from fresh, raw food.

00:09:15.737 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Aside from energy,
I mean, what is it actually

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
doing on a cellular level
and also to the DNA?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, it turns out
that the biochemical reactions

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:84%
in biochemistry in college
and various schools, they

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
talk about the Krebs
energy cycle, which

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:90%
is an energy cycle in the body.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Citric acid cycle, in which we
make adenosine triphosphate,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
ATP, which is the main
energy molecule in the body.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And they show various chemicals
with protons coming in.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:84%
There's hydrogen without
any electrons coming in.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And then it shows the electrons
coming into the reaction,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and minerals being-- elements
being replaced, like phosphates

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But they never tell
you where the electrons

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:90%
come from in human body.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
They just, like, oh, they
just come from somewhere.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that the
electron carrier, of course,

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
in the human body, which is
well known in biochemistry,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and one electron
carrier is NADH,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
nicotine adenine dinucleotide
hydride, which is--

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Easy for you to say.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Is a coenzyme in
the body that carries hydrogen

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
into the cells with a negative
electron, H-minus ions.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And those H-minus ions
then depose phosphate bond

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
from ADP-- I mean oxygen from
ADP, forming a third phosphate

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:84%
bond called ATP, which
gives us all our energy.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I've discovered that
the electron that does that

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:90%
is H-minus ions.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.927 align:middle line:84%
So I discovered a way of
making lots of H-minus ions

00:11:09.927 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:90%
and taking them inside the body.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course you did.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.581 align:middle line:90%
How did you isolate that?

00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you
have-- I mean, this

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
isn't meant to be an
infomercial by any means,

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
but has anybody else come
up with the same technology

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.626 align:middle line:90%
for isolating it now?

00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean this was quite a long
time ago, so a lot of people

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:90%
are doing it now.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.478 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, yeah.

00:11:25.478 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Well we've published
a dozen papers or so

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
in scientific journals,
and other scientists

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:90%
are doing that.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.759 align:middle line:84%
There's a Russian scientist
now that says he invented it.

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Well you've got the paper trail.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the papers
from a long time ago.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking about
picking up that extra electron,

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:84%
now we're talking about kind
of the bioelectrical body.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know you understand
electricity and energy

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:90%
on a very unique level.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah,
and DNA repair.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk
about how this figures in.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, our bodies
are assaulted all the time

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.130 align:middle line:90%
by free radicals.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Not human free
radicals, necessarily,

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:90%
but chemical free radicals.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And the free radicals
steal electrons from DNA,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:90%
break the DNA strand.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not
repaired, then we

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:90%
get various diseases and things.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And the body has DNA
repair capabilities,

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
but the hydrogen ladder of DNA
is made up of hydrogen atoms.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And so in order
to repair DNA, you

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
need H-minus ions,
negative ionized hydrogen.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.147 align:middle line:84%
And you can repair
a lot of damage.

00:12:39.147 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I find it fascinating.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I notice,
even myself, if I

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
should become depleted
on some level, what

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I call it is-- I
mean for me, it's

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.971 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of I'm not running
electricity through the body

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:90%
properly.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:90%
My electrical system is down.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing I notice.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.657 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly
what's going on?

00:12:57.657 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we need to
have that electrical cycle,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that flow of electricity to
be able to repair damaged

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
cells, DNA for
energy production.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So this missing electron
that MegaH-- or the product's

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:84%
MegaH-- but the negatively
ionized hydrogen brings in

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
is kind of that
little holy grail?

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.448 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can get it
in, like you say, fresh foods.

00:13:20.448 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh yeah,
fresh foods and juices,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:90%
and you've got plenty of it.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing is that
all the antioxidants in nature,

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the colors in
fresh vegetables and fruits

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or it's vitamin C,
all of them actually

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:84%
have negative ionized hydrogen
as the active ingredient

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:90%
in the anti-oxidant.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Like vitamin C is
ascorbic acid, but when

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.505 align:middle line:84%
it's neutralized
to free radical,

00:13:52.505 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:84%
it becomes dehydroascorbic
acid, meaning

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
it lost a hydrogen,
which happened

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:90%
to be negative ionized hydrogen.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And so this
discovery is what helped a lot.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.915 align:middle line:90%
The body is very electrical.

00:14:05.915 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a whole thing
called the electric universe

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:84%
where they're talking
about plasma interactions

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:84%
between the planets and
the comets and things.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the human
body, we have what's

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:90%
called the bioelectric body.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the circuits
in the body are electronic,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:90%
electrical in nature.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things are
being discovered in DNA,

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:90%
like it's a laser.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.891 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because if you

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
look at it on an atomic level,
just the table of elements,

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
for example, take one of
them that has maybe a fewer

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
number of electrons, it
looks just like the cosmos.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
as above, so below.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.896 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're missing certain
of those elements, of course

00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
our body shouldn't
be able to function.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And certainly not in concert
with the whole, right.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We go out of
relationship with the whole.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Right, the
music of the sphere.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:84%
The little atoms in our
bodies are making music

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and the planets are
making music and they

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.194 align:middle line:84%
should be in concert
with each other.

00:15:08.194 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and so let's

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
talk about the water
factor in that.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that's one of the fluid
bonding factors or mediums.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well most people
notice that when you get older,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:90%
you get a lot of wrinkles.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And they get more and more
as you get older, usually.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And we do creams and
all kinds of things.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.450 align:middle line:90%
People do anyway.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But I'm lucky, because
what's happened

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
is that early on in
my life, I learned

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that water is the most
important nutrient in our bodies

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and that not all water is equal.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not just H2O, and
because it has structure.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, when
we're born, we're 90% water.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.967 align:middle line:84%
And as adults, our brains
should be about 90% water.

00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
plump little baby skin.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything's nice
and plump and fluid.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.429 align:middle line:84%
And then we just watch it
dehydrate as the years go on.

00:16:07.429 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: And flexible.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.219 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And so
water, I was taught

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
when I was 17 years old-- I
was a child prodigy working

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
at the Pentagon-- and
Doctor Henri Coanda,

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
fluid dynamic
scientist, taught me

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that water is the most
important nutrient in our bodies

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and really made me aware that
my study should be water.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I followed his advice and
have studied water all my life,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:43.015 align:middle line:84%
for over 50 years now,
and made a lot of--

00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:44.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
questions about it,

00:16:44.515 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
then, because right now you have
all different camps on water

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:90%
raging.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can get
the Hunza water.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can go to Vilcabamba
and drink the water.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:90%
But we can't all do that.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
these various ways

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
you can put MegaH in water,
which creates some of that

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
if you're doing it in
that crystallized form.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But the arguments
are really more right

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:84%
now between alkalized water,
ionized water, distilled water.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what you
think about all this,

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.339 align:middle line:84%
because you've invested your
scientific mind into it for so

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well the
process of metabolism

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:90%
is acidic for the most part.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
So we make a lot of acid,
poisonous byproducts.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dioxide is acidic
when it's in water.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what carbonic acid
is, or soda water is.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
It's acid because of
the carbon dioxide.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And our cells exhale
carbon dioxide.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the foods
that we eat are acid.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:90%
And so we have to alkalinize.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But not all
alkalizers are equal.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Like sodium bicarbonate is
the best alkalizer there is.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just to put a little
baking soda in water, right.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Just a tiny bit, a little pinch.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Because if water
is too acid, it alkalizes it.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And if it's too alkaline,
sodium bicarbonate

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:84%
brings it to the right
range that the body wants.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're too
alkaline, it's really just

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:90%
as bad as being over acid.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we have
a very small tolerance

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.730 align:middle line:84%
range in the human
body for that.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.459 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would you say,
if you have an alkalizer

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're using
an alkalizer, say

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
you wanted to spend
the extra few thousand

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
instead of get $1.29
box of the baking soda.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
What is the best range to set
it in if it's reading true?

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well you want
it to be about pH of 9.5

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
if it's one of those
electronic alkalizers,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:90%
because that's not caustic.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
If you were to put sodium
hydroxide in water,

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%
it would go up there-- 9.5, 10.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's caustic, and
you can't use that.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It'll hurt you.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so 9.5 if you've
got a, we won't name names,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
but if you have a
quality machine that

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:84%
passes all the specs
scientifically.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Or you can use a
little baking soda.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:90%
But what about distilled water?

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of rage about
distilled water, too.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well first of
all, minerals in hard water

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:90%
we can't really use.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies can't,
they're inorganic.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And the body can
organify some minerals.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:90%
It tries to make them organic.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:84%
It uses up a lot of materials
and a lot of energy.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
what you want to do

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
is get organic
minerals from food.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And a cup of tea
or a cup of coffee

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:84%
has more usable minerals than
five gallons of well water.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.133 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:19:43.133 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes,
because they're organic.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And in my own body, I have
only used distilled water

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.529 align:middle line:84%
since I was 17, which
was over 53 years ago.

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you have your
own distillation unit, then?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
You just distill your
water or you buy it?

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I used to
have my own distiller.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
But now I can say that
they have good ghee.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:10.540 align:middle line:84%
The reverse osmosis
devices that make

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.450 align:middle line:84%
water as good as
distilled water.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I have a special
reverse osmosis now.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I put a little
tester in it says zero PPM.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:90%
It's really pure.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But then I add food and things
to my water, and juices,

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and I get all my
minerals that way.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go into
the other part of that story.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.225 align:middle line:84%
Because part of
this conference, we

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:84%
were listening to a
talk on the notion

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:90%
of the toxicity of radiation.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
this on camera before.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So getting into the
food portion of it

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and the sulfur
portion of the story,

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
to start dumping
toxins from cells,

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.467 align:middle line:84%
and then rebuilding
with the MegaH.

00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're giving a
little prescription

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.075 align:middle line:90%
at this stage for us.

00:20:54.075 --> 00:20:55.116 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right, right.

00:20:55.116 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:84%
As you know, first
we had Chernobyl

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and that was bad enough.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But now Fukushima's gone
off and Japanese government

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:84%
isn't really admitting
how bad it is.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.207 align:middle line:84%
For some, well, whatever
reason is theirs.

00:21:16.207 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Political.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Political reason.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we now know that the
entire west coast of the United

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
States all the way to the tip
of South America from Alaska

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:84%
all down has a lot of
radioactive byproducts

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
in the water, on
the land, in food.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And we need to figure
out what kind of diets

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:90%
and how we can detoxify from it.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it is spreading
all over the world.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it'll be in
north and south of the equator.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we're doing our best to
figure out what to do about it,

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
things we can do.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:84%
We can take what's called
organic sulfur, which is also

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:84%
called MSM, which is
methylsulfonylmethane.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you have to
be careful the source of it.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.738 align:middle line:84%
Not all the little
capsules you see

00:22:08.738 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
in the-- we talked with
Patrick McGean recently,

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and so he explained a
fair amount about that.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So for anybody watching,
you can certainly

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.650 align:middle line:84%
go to the Patrick
McGean interview

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:90%
for details on organic sulfur.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But talk about why
it's important.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Sulfur
happens to form compounds

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:84%
with I think it's 142 or
144 compounds with all

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the elements on the atomic
table except for iodine.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's a good
reason for that.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.215 align:middle line:84%
Because when you take
a sulfur compound

00:22:45.215 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
into your body like MSM, it
can form plutonium sulfate,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.305 align:middle line:84%
platinum sulfate,
and cesium sulfate.

00:22:56.305 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of radionuclides that
are harmful to the body

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.690 align:middle line:84%
are being spewed
out by Fukushima,

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and we're breathing
it into our lungs

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:90%
and we're eating it on our food.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And the way you get rid of
those radioactive elements,

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
one way, really good way, is to
take at least three teaspoons

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:90%
of MSM every day.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it forms
compounds with the heavy metals

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:90%
and then eliminates them--

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of chelates
them out of the body.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.276 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Because
sulfates can't

00:23:29.276 --> 00:23:32.820 align:middle line:84%
stay in the body more
than about 12 hours.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so if we're
finding a good source--

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and we can refer to
McGean-- of organic sulfur,

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and we're chelating this
stuff out of the body,

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
you were saying earlier that
the negatively ionized hydrogen

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.582 align:middle line:84%
or Mega Hydrate,
even the product,

00:23:47.582 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're
doing the product

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
or your juices, also it has a
very short life in the body.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right, it does.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.880 align:middle line:90%
So you have to do it every day.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.109 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have
to do it-- is once a day?

00:23:59.109 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what would you
prescribe to people?

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
We got the three teaspoons
of organic sulfur.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: If you wanted to
do it more than that, if you

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have it in
your body 24 hours a day,

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:84%
you've got to take a good dose,
and then 12 hours later take

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:90%
another dose.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Or you can take smaller doses
twice during the 12 hour period

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:90%
and twice during the next one.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.359 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes take it
before I go to bed and--

00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And when you wake up.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And when I get up
in the morning or mid morning.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:90%
But it works very well.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there's other
things that you can do.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:84%
The reason it won't
sulfate iodine

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.967 align:middle line:84%
is that the iodine sulfate
would pull thyroid iodine out

00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of your body, which we need
desperately for our thyroid.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which will kill us.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Right
which would kill us.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.850 align:middle line:84%
But then there's radioactive
iodine going around.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And so I take iodine supplement.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I get about 50
milligrams of iodine

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
from the equivalent
of what's called

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Lugol's solution every
day to protect my thyroid,

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.462 align:middle line:90%
because I want to live.

00:25:10.462 --> 00:25:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if I have
a short life or a long life,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.370 align:middle line:90%
but I'd like to be healthy.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
If it's longer, I
want to be healthy.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.914 align:middle line:84%
We have about five
minutes left, so I

00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:84%
thought we'd get
into the larger--

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:84%
since we only have that
much time left-- the larger

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.742 align:middle line:84%
philosophical
discussion about it.

00:25:25.742 --> 00:25:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said
in the beginning,

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
we're at an
immortality conference.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have organic
ways of extending

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:84%
life, which is what we've
just been talking about.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Then you have extremely
technological means

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of prolonging life going
into something that's

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
being called
transhumanist movement.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a soul
that has its own-- maybe you

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.190 align:middle line:84%
can say-- comes in with
an expiration date.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that for a
moment and how you perceive it.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you've perceived
your lineage in past

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:90%
lives and so forth.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right, yeah.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:84%
if you're into past
lives and you've

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:84%
been regressed and
experienced that possibility,

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:84%
then you'd say, well the body
in some very esoteric books

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and some-- a lot
of ancient books

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.650 align:middle line:84%
talk about that the body's
like wearing a suit of clothes.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets old,
and it gets dumped,

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and then you pick
up another one.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all
immortal, that we're

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:84%
all immortal beings experiencing
what it's like to be in a body.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the other side is
transhumanism and the idea

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can pull
all the memories out

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
of a person's brain
and personality traits

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and everything and
put it in a computer,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
put that into a robot,
and you'll live happily

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.507 align:middle line:90%
ever after in a robot's body.

00:26:47.507 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does that fit with
the notion of having a spirit

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
or soul that's
infusing everything?

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And not only
that, but you might find out

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:84%
living in a robot body isn't
nearly as pleasurable as living

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:90%
in a body that can have sex.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.356 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And have
strawberry shortcake.

00:27:05.356 --> 00:27:06.064 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:27:06.064 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Well that, too.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:14.620 align:middle line:84%
We all have different pleasures
at different ages in our life.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:84%
When you're a child,
there's nothing

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:84%
more pleasurable
than mother's milk.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you get a little
older, it's ice cream.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And get a little older and
you get to reproduction.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on and on.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So there are pleasures
being in the body.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're looking
at that, we are on our way

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
to extended life from
what we're hearing

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:84%
from every source,
every quarter, even ETs.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.830 align:middle line:84%
We're on our way
to extended life.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Is this because of the
reintroduction or discovery

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.200 align:middle line:84%
of things like negatively
ionized hydrogen, MSM?

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of
that, or is there

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:84%
something happening, maybe
an impulse cosmically

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.652 align:middle line:90%
that might even be extending us?

00:27:53.652 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: All of the above.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:10%
But you know, I
think personally I

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:04.910 align:middle line:10%
would rather-- if I happened
to aspire-- because I've

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:10%
died several times
and left my body

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.810 align:middle line:10%
and come back-- that I am
a soul living in this body.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:10%
And I would hate to think
that if just all my memories

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.580 align:middle line:10%
and personalities were put in a
computer that my soul, that me,

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.515 align:middle line:10%
the real me, which is who I
am, not those personalities.

00:28:22.515 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:10%
Because our personalities--

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.848 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Those are temporal.

00:28:24.848 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:10%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, that that
could be transferred to a robot

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:10%
and it'd be a pretty
interesting robot, maybe,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:10%
but my soul would
be being reborn

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:10%
somewhere else in a body.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.590 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm with you on that.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I find the transhumanist
movement rather disturbing,

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be
fear driven by people

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.690 align:middle line:84%
who believe there is
nothing beyond physicality.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a way
to kind of extend

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:84%
that little window of time
experience for a little bit

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.700 align:middle line:90%
longer.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well I want to know,
if they get us into a robot,

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and the robot has
the personality

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and has lots of fun, does
the robot dream at night

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and leave his body,
the robot body

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.681 align:middle line:84%
and walk around the universe
and then come back to its body

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well it's
going to be interesting.

00:29:12.013 --> 00:29:14.620 align:middle line:84%
If you saw the movie
"Her"-- did you see "Her?"

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:84%
That was a very
interesting concept.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Because just spinning
intelligence into motion itself

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:24.254 align:middle line:84%
is self replicating and aspiring
to more in and of itself

00:29:24.254 --> 00:29:26.045 align:middle line:84%
in that film the way
it goes, which I think

00:29:26.045 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:84%
there's-- that's an
interesting level of truth.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.469 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have to do
with that thing called soul.

00:29:32.469 --> 00:29:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I don't know.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:34.718 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well maybe it does.

00:29:34.718 --> 00:29:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it will create that.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Maybe
that's the new creation.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to leave
that as a big question mark.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And Patrick, thank
you so much for taking

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of time.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I think your message
is extremely important,

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:84%
so I wanted to nab
you while we could.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.450 align:middle line:90%

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:90%
