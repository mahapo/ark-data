[ Music ]

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.137 align:middle line:84%
>> We're fortunate to
have Dr. Joe Dispenza back

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.106 align:middle line:84%
with us once again and
today we'll be speaking

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.276 align:middle line:84%
about the mystery of the
placebo effect and much more.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.012 align:middle line:84%
The new thinking on the placebo
effect is not to dismiss it

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:48.015 align:middle line:84%
as a random event rather to
look into the depths of what's

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.818 align:middle line:84%
at work when the mind is engaged
to believe in a healthy outcome.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.421 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joe will explain the
latest science on the phenomena

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.291 align:middle line:84%
and deeper questions surrounding
it such as why do we need

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
to take the medicine when the
mind can create the healing

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.096 align:middle line:84%
effect and I think a lot of
people are interested in this.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.431 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us again.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Happy
to be with you again.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You're a little
ray of sunshine

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.001 align:middle line:90%
when you enter the building.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.703 align:middle line:90%
[laughter] Everybody's chirping.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about something

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.307 align:middle line:84%
that is probably
doging most people.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:17.978 align:middle line:84%
I'm always I think kind of
amazed out and about in speaking

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:20.747 align:middle line:84%
with friends how much
genuine suffering there is

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.884 align:middle line:84%
in the world among people who
would seemingly have no reason

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.819 align:middle line:84%
to perceive their
life as suffering.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.958 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it from
a mind/brain perspective,

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.494 align:middle line:84%
what would you say is
the greatest impetus

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.297 align:middle line:84%
for all the suffering that's
happening among otherwise

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
seemingly healthy and
prosperous people and not?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: I think
it's a great conversation

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.303 align:middle line:90%
to have.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
confuse pleasure with joy.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.743 align:middle line:84%
And so we have you know
stressors in our life

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:53.479 align:middle line:84%
and we experience frustration
and impatience and we suffer

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.582 align:middle line:90%
from conditions in our world.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.817 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:02:00.153 align:middle line:84%
I think it's healthy
that we can pay attention

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.488 align:middle line:90%
to how we're feeling.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.257 align:middle line:84%
The problem I think is that
when we react to something

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and we keep those chemicals
going for an extended period

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.464 align:middle line:84%
of time then we start to
memorize those emotional states

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:14.401 align:middle line:84%
and so when we get to that
point we start viewing our life

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.936 align:middle line:90%
through the lens of that emotion

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.872 align:middle line:84%
and for the most part an
emotion is a record of the past

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.608 align:middle line:84%
so really a viewing our life
through the lens of the past.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Now here's where it gets tricky

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.946 align:middle line:84%
because the moment we're
viewing our life in the lens

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:27.914 align:middle line:84%
of the past we're
always going to try

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:31.818 align:middle line:84%
to anticipate a future worst
case scenario based on the past.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Worst case scenario.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:33.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Of course.

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:33.987 align:middle line:90%
You got to be prepared --

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:34.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.057 align:middle line:84%
and protect yourself for
what's going to go wrong

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and when we do that, we
basically pick a potential

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.262 align:middle line:84%
in the quantum field
that's a known.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.331 align:middle line:90%
We focus on that experience

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
to the exclusion
of everything else.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.668 align:middle line:84%
The thought in our mind
literally becomes the experience

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.405 align:middle line:90%
and then we emotionally begin

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the event
before it takes place

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.777 align:middle line:84%
and our body physiologically
begins to respond

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:58.478 align:middle line:90%
as if it's in that future event.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.781 align:middle line:84%
To the body, it's
experiencing the event.

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:04.284 align:middle line:84%
And the body as the
unconscious mind, gets the rush

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:09.122 align:middle line:84%
of those chemicals and so in
time, we condition the body

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.691 align:middle line:84%
to live in that state of
suffering or that state

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.928 align:middle line:84%
of anticipation or dread
and the long term effects

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:17.264 align:middle line:84%
of that then is predicting
the future based

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:19.699 align:middle line:84%
on the past except we're
never in the present moment

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.536 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of torment
to the body is difficult.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.472 align:middle line:84%
So then when that occurs
then and if we get it right,

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.407 align:middle line:84%
you know, we pat ourselves
on the shoulder and we say,

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.875 align:middle line:90%
"God look at me, how smart I am.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.277 align:middle line:90%
You need to hang out with me."

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:32.412 align:middle line:84%
But when we don't get it
right we wind up in trouble.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: And we
start experiencing the vigilance

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.251 align:middle line:84%
and the discomfort and the
pain that goes along with it

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.755 align:middle line:84%
and then we look outside of
ourselves to find the way

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.557 align:middle line:84%
to change that feeling
inside of us.

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:48.595 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we'll use alcohol
or drugs or whatever to try

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.565 align:middle line:84%
to sedate or try to medicate
to reduce that feeling

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:54.167 align:middle line:84%
or by the same means if
we're thinking continuously

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:84%
about our past, in time we
begin to teach the body --

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:03:58.505 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --
emotionally to live in the past

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.508 align:middle line:84%
and the body is the unconscious
mind emotionally is living

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:04.478 align:middle line:84%
in the past so then the
same exact phenomena happens

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
because when we think
about our problems,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.783 align:middle line:84%
we're producing the same
chemistry in the brain and body

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:11.351 align:middle line:90%
as the event is takes place.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.254 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at a
functional brain scan of anxiety

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.889 align:middle line:84%
and depression they
look exactly the same.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.925 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is looking to the
future and depression is looking

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.896 align:middle line:84%
to the past and most people who
have anxiety do have depression.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:26.233 align:middle line:84%
So then now when we get
to that state we tend

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.702 align:middle line:90%
to complain about our problems.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:32.539 align:middle line:84%
We tend to get frustrated and
talk about them and when we do

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.574 align:middle line:84%
that then, we're
conditioning the body,

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:39.646 align:middle line:84%
we're enslaving the body into
those chemicals of suffering,

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.648 align:middle line:84%
those chemicals of
complaining, of blaming,

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.584 align:middle line:84%
of making excuses feeling
sorry for ourselves

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:49.456 align:middle line:84%
and that unconscious process
then is literally an addiction

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.891 align:middle line:90%
to the body.

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.826 align:middle line:84%
So then we were talking about
this when we were having a cup

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:55.262 align:middle line:84%
of coffee and that
addiction then is something

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:58.798 align:middle line:84%
that you cannot stop so the
body then gets tormented

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.635 align:middle line:84%
into these chemicals
of victimization

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.571 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes the
person's state of being.

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.407 align:middle line:84%
So then when it comes time
to change and you have

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to no longer think that way,
no longer behave that way,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
no longer feel that way,
you're stepping into that river

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.081 align:middle line:90%
of change and the hardest part

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.551 align:middle line:84%
about that is not
making the same choice.

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:18.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:20.253 align:middle line:84%
You know when you're talking
about that, I'm thinking

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:23.056 align:middle line:84%
of Don Miguel Ruiz and his
book, I think it was "The Voice

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.257 align:middle line:90%
of Knowledge" but he was talking

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.393 align:middle line:84%
about how your life
is your canvas,

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.094 align:middle line:84%
you can paint it
however you wish.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:31.264 align:middle line:84%
Well once you start getting the
subconscious programming going,

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.532 align:middle line:90%
you know, the computer program,

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:35.869 align:middle line:84%
the software that's been
programmed for this same pattern

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
of thought over and over,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.372 align:middle line:84%
really what are you doing
except adding more paint

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.241 align:middle line:90%
on the same weary old image.

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:42.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Yeah.

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:42.943 align:middle line:90%
It's an unconscious process.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.277 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an unconscious process.

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.412 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: People
say to me well I'm fasting

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:48.248 align:middle line:84%
from you know sugar or
I'm not eating chocolate

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.383 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not eating
any white foods.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.786 align:middle line:84%
You know what I tell them,
I said you really want to go

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:55.555 align:middle line:84%
on a fast, fast from
complaining.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:58.391 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] Fast from
guilt, fast from suffering.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:00.126 align:middle line:84%
Try that and give
you body a break --

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:00.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:04.231 align:middle line:84%
from those chemicals and when
your body is no longer getting

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:07.467 align:middle line:84%
that emotional rush, the
body is going to be just

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.102 align:middle line:84%
like an addict breaking
the addiction.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:11.071 align:middle line:84%
It's going to want you
to complain and blame --

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:12.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: It's
going to bring up scenes

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.376 align:middle line:84%
from your past just so the
body as the mind can reaffirm

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that identity and stepping into
that river of change, you know,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.449 align:middle line:84%
and no longer, you
know, becoming conscious

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.518 align:middle line:84%
of your unconscious thoughts,
you know, becoming aware

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.287 align:middle line:90%
of your habits and behaviors.

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Paying attention and
reserving your feelings.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.126 align:middle line:84%
When you do that and you step
into that river of change,

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:35.729 align:middle line:84%
there's -- you got to go from
the old self to the new self

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.765 align:middle line:84%
and crossing that river is the
biological, the neurological,

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.635 align:middle line:84%
the genetic, the chemical
death of the old self.

00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:43.436 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
want to cross that river

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.238 align:middle line:84%
because the moment they
feel uncomfortable they're

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.439 align:middle line:90%
feeling unfamiliar.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Well isn't it a matter
of discipline as well?

00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:49.943 align:middle line:84%
I mean, don't you have
to create interrupters

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:51.878 align:middle line:84%
in the thought pattern
and when you notice

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:54.881 align:middle line:84%
if you're mindful enough to
see, there I'm doing it again --

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:57.082 align:middle line:84%
I mean isn't it beneficial
to interrupt that

00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:58.718 align:middle line:90%
and not let that keep playing?

00:06:58.718 --> 00:06:59.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Yeah.

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:00.387 align:middle line:90%
That's one way.

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean by you interrupting
the process,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.793 align:middle line:84%
nerve cells that no longer
fire together are no longer

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:07.794 align:middle line:90%
wired together.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:08.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:10.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Your
conscious volition means

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:12.899 align:middle line:84%
when you're observing the
thought or paying attention

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.769 align:middle line:84%
to the thought it means
you're no longer the program.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.438 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: You're now
the consciousness observing the

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.908 align:middle line:84%
program and you begin to
objectify your subjective self.

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:25.178 align:middle line:84%
That process of self-observation
allows us

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.547 align:middle line:84%
to modify our behaviors
to do a better job in life

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.115 align:middle line:90%
and that's neuroplasticity.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:32.519 align:middle line:84%
And because of the size of the
frontal lobe, that forebrain,

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:35.422 align:middle line:84%
that mechanism of
metacognition allows us to think

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:36.523 align:middle line:90%
about how we're thinking.

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.025 align:middle line:84%
That's so we can really
modify who we are.

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:41.361 align:middle line:84%
>> So does a person not have
the choice even though we're

00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:43.897 align:middle line:84%
in these unconscious
programs to say okay,

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:45.465 align:middle line:84%
from this point forward
I am going

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.634 align:middle line:84%
to create a change
in that program.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.636 align:middle line:84%
I don't wish to live
like that any longer.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:53.073 align:middle line:84%
By simple will and
discipline, can you choose

00:07:53.073 --> 00:07:54.808 align:middle line:90%
to become the observer?

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.944 align:middle line:84%
Or is this something that has to
happen on another level first?

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Well you think

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.481 align:middle line:84%
about breaking an addiction to
say something like chocolate.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.917 align:middle line:84%
Okay? We'll just use
this as an example.

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
If you're addicted to chocolate
and I slid a chocolate cake

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.255 align:middle line:84%
in front of you,
the moment you saw

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:12.726 align:middle line:84%
that chocolate cake your brain
would start saying oh my God,

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, I want a
piece of chocolate,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.729 align:middle line:84%
everybody else is
eating chocolate.

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:16.996 align:middle line:90%
It's not that bad for you.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.231 align:middle line:90%
I can start tomorrow.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:22.202 align:middle line:84%
And your body would
autonomically, automatically,

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:26.706 align:middle line:84%
physiologically respond in the
presence of that chocolate cake

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:27.874 align:middle line:90%
without your conscious mind.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:28.441 align:middle line:90%
In other words --

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- if
you're addicted it's going

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.711 align:middle line:90%
to happen automatically.

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:35.081 align:middle line:84%
So then if you broke the
addiction to the chocolate cake,

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:37.851 align:middle line:84%
literally did not have
any addiction any longer.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:40.687 align:middle line:84%
If I slid that chocolate cake in
front of you, you could eat it

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
or not eat it and you would
have no response, okay?

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.124 align:middle line:90%
In other words you'd --

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:45.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --
have no physiological --

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:48.061 align:middle line:84%
your conscious mind and your
subconscious mind would really

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
be working together, but when
you're addicted your body has

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.933 align:middle line:84%
become the mind and your body's
overriding the conscious brain.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:55.201 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.237 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying you can't
zing in an observer type

00:08:57.237 --> 00:08:58.538 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness or you can?

00:08:58.538 --> 00:08:59.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Oh you can.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Will is one of the mechanisms --

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --
that allows us to do that.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.211 align:middle line:84%
But if you're addicted to
certain emotions in your life --

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.446 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:07.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- I
don't know, guilt or shame

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:11.718 align:middle line:84%
or unworthiness or insecurity
or rage or frustration,

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:15.655 align:middle line:84%
then by definition of a
quantum model, we use the people

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.323 align:middle line:90%
and conditions in our life

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:19.893 align:middle line:84%
to reaffirm our emotional
addictions

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:23.329 align:middle line:84%
so that we can remember who
we are as a somebody so then

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.198 align:middle line:84%
when people go with
their conscious will,

00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:26.766 align:middle line:90%
like they make a declaration,

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:30.069 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be no longer a
victim today, I'm going to live

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.571 align:middle line:90%
in the state of Grace,

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.174 align:middle line:84%
they start out with really
good intentions but you know,

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:36.676 align:middle line:84%
remember if the body's become
the mind then it's not getting

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.511 align:middle line:90%
its emotional addiction.

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:40.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: The
body's going to send signals

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.917 align:middle line:84%
to the brain and then you
walk back into your life

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and you see the person that
you use to reaffirm your guilt

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.423 align:middle line:84%
or your frustration just
like being in the presence

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:53.593 align:middle line:84%
of the chocolate cake, the
moment you see that person

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.929 align:middle line:84%
if you're addicted to that
emotion and you're using them

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.698 align:middle line:84%
to reaffirm it, just
like in the presence

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.033 align:middle line:84%
of the chocolate
cake your body's

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:03.436 align:middle line:84%
going to physiologically,
autonomically, automatically,

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:07.574 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously return back
to the old chemical self.

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:09.809 align:middle line:84%
In other words you're
going to go unconscious.

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:13.213 align:middle line:84%
So it takes an act
of willfulness --

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:14.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:15.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- to
make the choice and as we talk

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.752 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit, when we
make a choice to change,

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:26.259 align:middle line:84%
we have to make a choice
that has such an amplitude

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:29.329 align:middle line:84%
or intensity of energy
that the amplitude

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:33.633 align:middle line:84%
of choice becomes the
experience that literally begins

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.502 align:middle line:84%
to be greater than the
hard wired programs --

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:36.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.605 align:middle line:84%
in the brain than the
emotional addictions in the body

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:41.174 align:middle line:84%
and the body has to
respond to a new mind.

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:42.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:43.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: In other
words, the hair on the back

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.111 align:middle line:84%
of your neck has to stand up
and the body as the animal has

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:48.181 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh oh, she's
serious this time.

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:50.683 align:middle line:84%
It's not you sitting on the
couch with your smart phone here

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:54.787 align:middle line:84%
and your computer here and
remote control in your --

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.589 align:middle line:90%
going to change tomorrow.

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:57.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Your body is like relax,

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:58.958 align:middle line:90%
she's lying to herself again.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Nothing's going to change.

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.162 align:middle line:84%
So the act of willfulness
is one component

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.664 align:middle line:90%
but what our research shows is

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:08.835 align:middle line:84%
that where the programs exist
they exist in the subconscious.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Right?

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.538 align:middle line:90%
And it's in the body mind.

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.106 align:middle line:84%
So then the purpose of
meditation as we talked

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
about last time is to get
beyond the conscious mind,

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.446 align:middle line:84%
past the analytical mind,
into the subconscious mind

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.448 align:middle line:84%
where those programs exist
and that's the purpose

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.751 align:middle line:84%
of meditation, to get
beyond the analytical mind.

00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:26.119 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in the
operating system.

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: And
so as you become conscious

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:84%
of your unconscious thoughts
as you begin to pay attention

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.926 align:middle line:84%
to your behaviors and notice
your emotions you're actually

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.627 align:middle line:84%
going into the operating
system and bringing

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:35.762 align:middle line:90%
to your conscious awareness.

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:37.931 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because you don't
want those to slip

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:39.632 align:middle line:90%
by your awareness ever again.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:40.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
So then when you begin

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:44.637 align:middle line:84%
to decide then how you do
want to program and you begin

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:84%
to teach your body emotionally
what wealth feels like,

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
what freedom feels like,
what nobility is like.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.613 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to plan
your behaviors in your day,

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:55.582 align:middle line:84%
the act of rehearsing
who you're going

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:58.484 align:middle line:84%
to be installs the neurological
circuits in your brain.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.254 align:middle line:84%
You're priming your brain
so you have something to use

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:02.622 align:middle line:90%
when you open your eyes.

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:04.991 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to think about
what thoughts you do want

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:08.328 align:middle line:84%
to think about and fire
and wire in your brain,

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:11.798 align:middle line:84%
how you think how you act and
how you feel is your personality

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and your personality creates
your personal reality.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.037 align:middle line:84%
Now your job is to get up from
your meditation differently

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:18.938 align:middle line:90%
than when you sat down.

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:20.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:21.441 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: And you
have to be in a new state

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:23.576 align:middle line:84%
of being so that when you
walk back into your life

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.278 align:middle line:90%
and you've overcome your guilt

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:27.113 align:middle line:84%
or you've overcome
your frustration

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:29.616 align:middle line:84%
and the body's no longer
living in the past,

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:31.084 align:middle line:90%
it's now living in the future --

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.218 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:33.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --
the moment that happens,

00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:36.089 align:middle line:84%
you can walk in the presence
of your greatest adversary,

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.057 align:middle line:84%
your greatest enemy,
the person you used

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.592 align:middle line:90%
to reaffirm your addiction

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.794 align:middle line:84%
and you have no physiological
response anymore

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.097 align:middle line:84%
because you did the work
to overcome yourself.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:45.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So
I think it takes both.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:46.499 align:middle line:90%
I think it takes --

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:47.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:48.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- the
act of volition, the will --

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.268 align:middle line:90%
>> The choice --

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:50.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: The choice.

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:51.504 align:middle line:84%
>> -- the will and
the meditation.

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:52.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: And then
it takes going inward then

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:55.642 align:middle line:84%
and making that process
of retiring the old self

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:57.577 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to
reinvent a new self

00:12:57.577 --> 00:12:58.845 align:middle line:84%
and that's what our
research shows.

00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.281 align:middle line:84%
And you -- we're going to
get to some of that research

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:04.617 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit, but you
mentioned a little bit ago we go

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.820 align:middle line:84%
unconscious again and this is
a process we constantly do.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.824 align:middle line:84%
We can do all of the things you
just mentioned, for example,

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:14.794 align:middle line:84%
but it seems that the
default program is to go back

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:18.231 align:middle line:84%
into this unconscious state --
and we just barely touched on it

00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:20.767 align:middle line:84%
in our last interview,
why is that?

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Well 95% of who we are

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.637 align:middle line:84%
by the time we're 35
years old is this set

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.473 align:middle line:84%
of memorized behaviors and
emotional reactions, beliefs,

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
perceptions, attitudes that
function subconsciously

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.945 align:middle line:90%
like an automatic program.

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:37.383 align:middle line:84%
I mean literally, the body has
been conditioned to be the mind.

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.485 align:middle line:90%
So if 95% of who you are

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.722 align:middle line:84%
by the time you're 35 years
old is a redundant auto pilot

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:45.158 align:middle line:84%
behaviors -- that's
what a habit is --

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.394 align:middle line:84%
and you walk in to your life and
you're going to try to change

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:50.797 align:middle line:84%
and use the 5% of
your conscious mind

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:52.465 align:middle line:84%
and there's no emotional
quotient

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:54.133 align:middle line:90%
to really teach the body,

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
then the moment you have a stray
thought or the moment you react

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.305 align:middle line:84%
to something in your
life, you just press play.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:01.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: You
just pressed the program

00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:02.809 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
run and you're --

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Just like a computer program.

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:05.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- just
like a computer program.

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:08.147 align:middle line:84%
So you may, you know,
have two glasses of wine

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and will be walking home and
you need money and you go

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.185 align:middle line:84%
to your ATM machine
and you can't --

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.519 align:middle line:84%
you look at the ATM
numbers and you're like,

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.756 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember my numbers,
but you walk over and you look

00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:17.757 align:middle line:90%
at the key pad and all

00:14:17.757 --> 00:14:19.225 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden your
fingers dial the number.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Well how did you do that?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.096 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't consciously
remember, but you practiced it

00:14:23.096 --> 00:14:25.364 align:middle line:84%
so many times that your body
new better than your brain.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:25.865 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So there's
a program to brush your teeth.

00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:30.303 align:middle line:84%
There's a program
to comb your hair.

00:14:30.303 --> 00:14:31.704 align:middle line:84%
There's a program
to drive a car.

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.439 align:middle line:84%
There's a program
to speak a language.

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:90%
There's a program to complain.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.743 align:middle line:84%
There's a program
to judge others.

00:14:36.743 --> 00:14:39.278 align:middle line:84%
There's a program to push
to the front of the line.

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:42.415 align:middle line:90%
There's a program to compete.

00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:43.549 align:middle line:90%
That's the culture.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.619 align:middle line:84%
So then you put yourself
in the culture where all

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:50.089 align:middle line:84%
of that's normal and acceptable
and everybody else is doing it

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:52.492 align:middle line:84%
and the current's going
this way and your trying

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:55.962 align:middle line:84%
to swim upstream them,
it takes a certain amount

00:14:55.962 --> 00:14:59.565 align:middle line:84%
of awareness then to
go against what --

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:00.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Well to delete that file.

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:01.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:03.236 align:middle line:84%
and to go against
what feels so natural.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:05.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Like
this is so unnatural.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Well that's my definition of
genius being uncomfortable

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.641 align:middle line:90%
and being okay with it.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: When
I'm uncomfortable and okay

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.446 align:middle line:84%
with it I know I'm
crossing the river of change

00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:14.747 align:middle line:90%
and when you're crossing

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:17.383 align:middle line:84%
that river most people say
I can't predict my future

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:19.919 align:middle line:84%
because they can't predict
their guilt or their frustration

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.021 align:middle line:84%
but the best way to predict
your future when you're

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:90%
in that unknown is to create it.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.291 align:middle line:90%
Now's the time.

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:26.292 align:middle line:90%
You're in fertile ground.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.261 align:middle line:84%
You're in the uncertainty
principle.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.463 align:middle line:84%
You're in the unknown, that's
where all possibility exists.

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:32.799 align:middle line:84%
So right outside
of a comfort zone.

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:35.935 align:middle line:84%
Right outside of that
known, right outside

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
of that comfort zone is
where the magic happens.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:40.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So
we have to teach people

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:84%
to become comfortable
in that void.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:43.643 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: And
when they're comfortable

00:15:43.643 --> 00:15:44.977 align:middle line:84%
in that void then they're
in the place where oh gosh,

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:48.815 align:middle line:84%
now I'm in the unknown, so
you and I have been hypnotized

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and conditioned to believing
that the unknown is bad

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.119 align:middle line:84%
and if you're living by
the hormones of stress,

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.788 align:middle line:84%
if you're living by
aggression and anger and war

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:59.458 align:middle line:84%
and frustration and
hatred and all of those --

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.994 align:middle line:84%
fear and anxiety and
sadness and guilt and shame,

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:04.897 align:middle line:84%
the unknown is a scary place
and there's better chances

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:08.568 align:middle line:84%
in survival in antiquity from
running from the unknown.

00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:11.003 align:middle line:84%
So if you're living
by a lower denominator

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:14.373 align:middle line:84%
of those survival emotions then
everybody will always cling

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:15.575 align:middle line:90%
to the known.

00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:17.844 align:middle line:84%
So then tell me how does
the new experience happen?

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:21.047 align:middle line:84%
So then when we break the
addictions to those emotions

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and when you truly free yourself
from the chains of the past

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.687 align:middle line:84%
and the body liberates energy
and you feel lifted and joyful

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.755 align:middle line:84%
and inspired and you're
seeing a whole new landscape,

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:32.892 align:middle line:84%
a whole new horizon,
that creative state then,

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:35.294 align:middle line:84%
now you're going to select an
unknown and the unknown is going

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.865 align:middle line:84%
to become an adventure,
now that concept stepping

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:41.033 align:middle line:84%
out into the unknown
and trusting yourself,

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:43.803 align:middle line:84%
trusting in possibility,
trusting in the unknown,

00:16:43.803 --> 00:16:45.905 align:middle line:84%
that's the natural
state of being

00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:48.908 align:middle line:84%
but if you watch enough
news and you're conditioned

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:51.944 align:middle line:84%
that you need a certain
hair style or a certain look

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:56.449 align:middle line:84%
and to look you know anemic
and underweight and emaciated

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.385 align:middle line:84%
and that's beauty and everybody
else is trying to do the same --

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:02.955 align:middle line:84%
you know chasing false
ideals or much --

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:06.492 align:middle line:84%
or whatever people how we're
being conditioned to go

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:09.628 align:middle line:84%
against that really then means
that you have to learn a bit

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge about yourself and
the true nature of who we are.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.770 align:middle line:84%
That we are greater -- other
than our body we're greater

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.773 align:middle line:84%
than our environment and we live
beyond time and when you get

00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:23.175 align:middle line:90%
to that point or understand

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:26.679 align:middle line:84%
that you're a consciousness
now using the brain and body

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:29.849 align:middle line:84%
to create different levels of
mind to experience the canvas

00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:33.686 align:middle line:84%
of life then you start
to ask yourself then,

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:90%
there's got to be more.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.522 align:middle line:90%
Who am I? Why am I doing this?

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:39.592 align:middle line:84%
Why -- what is this -- what
is our meaning in life?

00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:43.062 align:middle line:84%
Those fundamental questions are
when the soul begins to wake up.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:46.299 align:middle line:84%
>> And all of this extends
into the physical also

00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:49.535 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking about these
wired programs we've created

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:52.638 align:middle line:84%
with as you say anxiety
or hatred,

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.206 align:middle line:90%
self-loathing and so forth.

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:56.275 align:middle line:90%
This all has a direct impact

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:58.544 align:middle line:84%
on the physiology
of the body as well.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:01.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Absolutely and look, it is no --

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:04.317 align:middle line:84%
there's no scientist
that would disagree

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:09.288 align:middle line:84%
that the long term effects of
these chemicals dysregulate

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:11.791 align:middle line:84%
and down regulate genes
and create disease.

00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:14.226 align:middle line:84%
It's a scientific
fact that the hormones

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:16.729 align:middle line:84%
of stress push the genetic
buttons that create disease

00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:19.198 align:middle line:84%
because no organism
in nature can live

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
in emergency mode all the time.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're anticipating
some worst case scenario

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.439 align:middle line:84%
or remembering some
event from your past.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Worry.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Worry
or suffering or whatever,

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:34.747 align:middle line:84%
then you're turning on
the stress response just

00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:37.116 align:middle line:84%
by thought alone and
if those chemicals

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:40.052 align:middle line:84%
of stress are highly
addictive you become addictive

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:90%
to your thoughts.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.255 align:middle line:84%
So then if you're
addicted to your thoughts

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.524 align:middle line:84%
and those thoughts
can make you sick,

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
the question is can you
thoughts make you well?

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.196 align:middle line:90%
So then what is the physiology

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:52.031 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanism
of how that happens?

00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:53.866 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's go in to
beliefs, perceptions,

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and morphogenetic fields and
Rupert Sheldrake's words.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Well, let's talk about it

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.107 align:middle line:84%
because where do our thoughts
and feelings come from?

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:04.443 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts and feelings
come from our memories.

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts and feelings come
from the things we're exposed

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.382 align:middle line:90%
to in terms of knowledge.

00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:10.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:11.217 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
And the experiences

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:12.218 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our life.

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:13.886 align:middle line:90%
So when you have an experience

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:16.322 align:middle line:84%
or you learn something
new your brain begins

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:18.858 align:middle line:84%
to physically change and
you wire that in your brain.

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:84%
You have new circuits
to reflect that event.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.429 align:middle line:84%
So there's a fingerprint
or footprint in your brain.

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:24.697 align:middle line:90%
When you have an experience

00:19:24.697 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and the experience produces
an emotional quotient --

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.369 align:middle line:84%
that's what experiences do
they have a residue of emotion.

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:32.938 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are the end
product of experience --

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:35.074 align:middle line:84%
then how you think
and how you feel

00:19:35.074 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
for the most part is
a record of your past

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.079 align:middle line:84%
and your brain is an
artifact of the past.

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:42.181 align:middle line:84%
It is a reflection of
everything you've been exposed

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.416 align:middle line:90%
to in your environment.

00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:47.586 align:middle line:84%
And your body if you're
living by the same emotion

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.588 align:middle line:84%
and those thoughts are
driving the emotions

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.023 align:middle line:84%
and the emotions are
driving the thoughts

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.592 align:middle line:84%
and the thoughts are driving
the emotions then your body

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:56.095 align:middle line:84%
as the unconscious
mind is believing it's

00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:59.732 align:middle line:84%
in the past experience 24
hours a day, 7 days a week,

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:00.933 align:middle line:90%
365 days a year.

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.936 align:middle line:84%
To the body, it's
literally living in the past.

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:06.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
So now if our thoughts

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:10.309 align:middle line:84%
and feelings then are
a record of the past

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.911 align:middle line:84%
and you take a series
of thoughts

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and you connect a thought to a
feeling, a thought to a feeling,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.948 align:middle line:84%
a thought to a feeling,
a thought to a feeling,

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:90%
that's called an attitude.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.418 align:middle line:84%
So you have a series of good
thoughts that are connected

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:90%
to a series of good feelings,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.322 align:middle line:84%
you say I have a pretty
good attitude, you know?

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:25.257 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a series
of negative thoughts

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:84%
that are connected to
some negative feelings,

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.795 align:middle line:84%
you would say I have
a pretty bad attitude.

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:35.134 align:middle line:84%
Now how you think and how you
feel creates a state of being.

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:37.002 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are the
language of the brain

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:40.573 align:middle line:84%
and feelings are the language
of the body and how you think

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:43.142 align:middle line:84%
and how you feel
creates a state of being.

00:20:43.142 --> 00:20:44.477 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:48.647 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you take an attitude,
an attitude, an attitude,

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:50.282 align:middle line:90%
and you string a series

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:53.285 align:middle line:84%
of attitudes together
that's called a belief

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:56.822 align:middle line:84%
and a belief is just an
extended state of being.

00:20:56.822 --> 00:20:59.658 align:middle line:84%
So if an attitude is a
shortened state of being

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:03.129 align:middle line:84%
and a belief is elongated state
of being we could say then

00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:05.431 align:middle line:84%
that a belief is a
thought you keep thinking

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:06.599 align:middle line:90%
over and over again --

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:08.334 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --

00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:09.535 align:middle line:84%
until you fire and
wire it in your brain

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:12.771 align:middle line:84%
and it has a component of
emotion that then begins

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:16.609 align:middle line:84%
to condition the body
into believing it's true.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.745 align:middle line:84%
So then if you keep thinking and
feeling and feeling and thinking

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.881 align:middle line:84%
in the same way and
you condition your body

00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:26.318 align:middle line:84%
to be the mind of that state of
being an unconscious process,

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:29.655 align:middle line:84%
then a belief is an
unconscious state of being.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.957 align:middle line:84%
So we have beliefs about
money, we have beliefs

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
about spirituality, we have
beliefs about relationships,

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.330 align:middle line:84%
we have beliefs about drugs
and pills and medicine.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.799 align:middle line:84%
We have beliefs about
governments.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.801 align:middle line:84%
We have beliefs about
everything, weight,

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.571 align:middle line:90%
diet, it's all beliefs.

00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:49.475 align:middle line:84%
So then a belief is an
extended state of being

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
that becomes an unconscious
process

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
because the body has been
hard wired neurologically

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.348 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally conditioned.

00:21:56.348 --> 00:22:00.452 align:middle line:84%
So the boundaries of our beliefs
then become the way we feel

00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:02.421 align:middle line:84%
about things so when
you're exposed

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:04.657 align:middle line:84%
to a new belief [laughter]
and it's outside

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.959 align:middle line:90%
of your emotional acceptance,

00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:08.761 align:middle line:84%
that's the moment people
say I don't believe it,

00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:09.795 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't feel right.

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:10.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:90%
It meets resistance.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Right.

00:22:12.598 --> 00:22:15.701 align:middle line:84%
So then if you take a belief
and you string beliefs, beliefs,

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:18.470 align:middle line:84%
beliefs, beliefs together,
that's called a perception

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.372 align:middle line:84%
and a perception
has everything to do

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:23.576 align:middle line:84%
with the relationships you
have, the choices you've make,

00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:27.213 align:middle line:84%
the things you create and the
behaviors that you demonstrate.

00:22:27.213 --> 00:22:30.616 align:middle line:84%
So then in order to change
your beliefs and perceptions

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:34.753 align:middle line:84%
about yourself and your life,
you have to change your state

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:38.457 align:middle line:84%
of being and in order to
change your state of being,

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:41.794 align:middle line:84%
you have to make a decision
with such firm intention

00:22:41.794 --> 00:22:45.598 align:middle line:84%
that the amplitude of that
decision carries an emotional

00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:48.434 align:middle line:84%
quotient or a level of
energy that's greater

00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:50.569 align:middle line:84%
than the hard wired
programs in your brain

00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:53.639 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional conditioning
of your body or addiction

00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:56.575 align:middle line:84%
of your body and your
body literally responds

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:57.843 align:middle line:90%
to a new mind.

00:22:57.843 --> 00:23:00.646 align:middle line:84%
In other words, [laughter]
how can a person in a state

00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:03.082 align:middle line:84%
of religious ecstasy
drink strychnine

00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:04.984 align:middle line:90%
and have no biological effects?

00:23:04.984 --> 00:23:07.186 align:middle line:84%
They make a decision to
change their state of being

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:08.487 align:middle line:90%
and it's energy that does that.

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:09.855 align:middle line:90%
It's electromagnetism.

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:12.391 align:middle line:84%
They're not saying jeez, I
wonder if this is poison.

00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:13.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:13.626 --> 00:23:14.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: The
moment they're in that state --

00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:15.894 align:middle line:84%
they're in a limited
state of being.

00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.896 align:middle line:84%
They're more matter
and less energy.

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:19.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:20.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: How
can a person in a state

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:24.069 align:middle line:84%
of absolute faith chew on glass
and have no biological effects?

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Their decision in that moment
transcends their biology.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.375 align:middle line:90%
It transcends their circuitry.

00:23:29.375 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:90%
It transcends their genetics.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.279 align:middle line:84%
In that moment they're
out of time.

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:36.582 align:middle line:84%
A person who takes a
poisonous snake in a state

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:39.485 align:middle line:84%
of absolute certainty and allows
the poisonous snake to bite them

00:23:39.485 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and they have no
blood coagulation.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.721 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.657 align:middle line:84%
They're in a different
state of being.

00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Their choice then
transcends the old and in

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.331 align:middle line:84%
that moment their body literally
is immune to the conditions

00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:55.567 align:middle line:84%
in their environment and they're
literally living outside time.

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So then the woman who takes
-- sees her baby caught --

00:23:58.570 --> 00:23:59.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:00.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --
under the car and flips --

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
-- the car over.

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:03.609 align:middle line:84%
She's not wondering I
wonder how heavy this car is

00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:04.977 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't work out
for the last two months.

00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
She's making a decision and her
body's responding to a new mind.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.619 align:middle line:84%
So then if a belief is an
unconscious state of being then

00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:16.522 align:middle line:84%
in order for us to
then make a change

00:24:16.522 --> 00:24:19.391 align:middle line:84%
and let's just say your
belief about something

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:22.528 align:middle line:84%
because of your past
experience with relationships --

00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:25.931 align:middle line:84%
we'll make this up -- you have
experiences in relationships

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and those experiences have
an amplitude of energy.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.303 align:middle line:84%
In other words the experience
has a neurological imprint

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:34.073 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and an emotion
that's conditioned in the body.

00:24:34.073 --> 00:24:35.908 align:middle line:90%
And that's really your past.

00:24:35.908 --> 00:24:38.444 align:middle line:84%
So then from that
experience you view your life

00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:39.545 align:middle line:90%
from this experience.

00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:40.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:41.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Well in order for you

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:42.981 align:middle line:84%
to rewrite the program the
amplitude of choice has

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:45.417 align:middle line:84%
to be greater, the
amplitude has to be greater

00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:47.219 align:middle line:84%
than that experience
and if it is

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:50.289 align:middle line:84%
and it rewrites the
program neurologically

00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:53.392 align:middle line:84%
and conditions the body
emotionally then the past no

00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:56.095 align:middle line:84%
longer exists because the
choices and experience

00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that you never forget
and the end product

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.166 align:middle line:84%
of an experience is an
elevated emotion and that's

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.935 align:middle line:90%
when the body begins to change.

00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:05.337 align:middle line:84%
>> So now what about the
morphogenetic field portion

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:06.338 align:middle line:90%
of the story?

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:08.107 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come in?

00:25:08.107 --> 00:25:11.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Well,
if you think about this,

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:14.613 align:middle line:84%
there are morphogenetic
fields that have to do with --

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:15.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:16.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
-- everything.

00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:16.849 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:18.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Right?

00:25:18.217 --> 00:25:20.452 align:middle line:84%
So there's a morphogenetic field
that pharmaceuticals do this

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:23.756 align:middle line:84%
and Prozac does that
and you know,

00:25:23.756 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:90%
these injections help you here

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.292 align:middle line:84%
and this is the treatment
for chemotherapy.

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:84%
That's our present --
what we have to offer.

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:31.296 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:32.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:33.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: That's
our greatest expression

00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:35.033 align:middle line:90%
of health right now.

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:37.736 align:middle line:84%
>> So is the morphogenetic
field directly intertwined then

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:40.072 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness
and belief systems?

00:25:40.072 --> 00:25:40.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Yes.

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.074 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:45.043 align:middle line:84%
So people then have a belief
through their experience

00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:47.079 align:middle line:90%
and through their conditioning

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:49.615 align:middle line:84%
that these elements
are going to help them.

00:25:49.615 --> 00:25:52.317 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact if
they believe that they will,

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:55.788 align:middle line:84%
there's a greater chance
that they will help them

00:25:55.788 --> 00:25:59.658 align:middle line:84%
and if the doctor, if she or
he are sitting in the presence

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:02.094 align:middle line:84%
of them and tells them
what it's going to do

00:26:02.094 --> 00:26:04.763 align:middle line:84%
and they have the right body
language and the right presence,

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:07.433 align:middle line:84%
their belief in accepting
that works even greater.

00:26:07.433 --> 00:26:12.905 align:middle line:84%
So now, so then morphogenetic
field of what's possible now,

00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:15.207 align:middle line:84%
so if this is a huge
morphogenetic field

00:26:15.207 --> 00:26:18.076 align:middle line:84%
of pharmaceuticals and
now we're teaching people

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:20.579 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually
change their state of being

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:23.081 align:middle line:84%
without relying on a sugar
pill, without relying

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
on a saline injection.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.587 align:middle line:84%
That's a philosophical concept
but it doesn't have an imprint

00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:31.523 align:middle line:84%
through experience, enough
imprinting through experience

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:36.762 align:middle line:84%
in the quantum field so then if
you're overcoming your anxiety

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:39.064 align:middle line:84%
and the person next to
you is overcoming their MS

00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:41.934 align:middle line:84%
and then a person down the
street is overcoming their

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:45.404 align:middle line:84%
chronic pain by changing
their state of being

00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:48.607 align:middle line:84%
without any resources outside
of them, without any drugs

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:51.543 align:middle line:84%
without any surgeries,
they're changing it just

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:53.145 align:middle line:84%
by changing their
state of being.

00:26:53.145 --> 00:26:56.782 align:middle line:84%
If enough of those people
imprint that experience

00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:57.616 align:middle line:90%
into the quantum field --

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:26:59.051 --> 00:27:00.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- because
the experience literally begins

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:02.754 align:middle line:84%
to upscale the knowledge
and the field.

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:03.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:04.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
In other words,

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:05.591 align:middle line:90%
it's an information field.

00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:07.326 align:middle line:84%
So now you've access
so the more you do it

00:27:07.326 --> 00:27:09.995 align:middle line:84%
and the more we have people
doing it, that community

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:13.832 align:middle line:84%
of experience begins to expand
and it becomes more accessible

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:16.835 align:middle line:84%
because it's more
readily available.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:19.438 align:middle line:84%
>> So does it -- it's no
longer a vague theory.

00:27:19.438 --> 00:27:24.209 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a plasma
with intelligence of sorts

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:25.511 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the field is.

00:27:25.511 --> 00:27:26.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Beyond space and time.

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:28.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond space and
time that you can plug

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:30.282 align:middle line:90%
into as a healing ally.

00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:31.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Absolutely.

00:27:31.283 --> 00:27:32.784 align:middle line:84%
>> It's there to
support your decisions.

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:33.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Right.

00:27:33.452 --> 00:27:34.586 align:middle line:90%
So think about this.

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:37.956 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about it
because more than 50%

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:43.061 align:middle line:84%
of every person that's on their
way to their first chemotherapy,

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:47.399 align:middle line:84%
50% or more, on the way to their
first chemo therapy treatment

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.301 align:middle line:90%
they get nauseous on their drive

00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:84%
over to their first
chemotherapy treatment --

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:53.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- because
the doctor told them they're

00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:90%
going to get nauseous.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.109 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they selected a
potential in the quantum field.

00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:58.744 align:middle line:90%
They focused on that potential

00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:00.612 align:middle line:84%
to the exclusion
of everything else.

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:02.748 align:middle line:84%
They had the thought,
that's clear intention,

00:28:02.748 --> 00:28:05.117 align:middle line:84%
and they married with that
clear intention with the emotion

00:28:05.117 --> 00:28:06.451 align:middle line:90%
of how they're going to feel.

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:08.453 align:middle line:84%
When you think and feel
a certain way you move

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:10.989 align:middle line:84%
into a state of being
and they knock their body

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:13.559 align:middle line:84%
out of balance just
by thought alone.

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:16.194 align:middle line:84%
So if 50% of every
person on their way

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:18.897 align:middle line:84%
to their first chemotherapy
treatment gets sick

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:21.266 align:middle line:84%
on their drive over,
50% of the people

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:22.534 align:middle line:90%
in this culture can get well

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.403 align:middle line:84%
on their drive -- on
their way to work.

00:28:24.403 --> 00:28:27.873 align:middle line:84%
It's the same exact thing
it's just the expectation

00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:30.576 align:middle line:84%
of either choosing in
something wonderful happening --

00:28:30.576 --> 00:28:31.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:32.411 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --

00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:33.745 align:middle line:84%
or choosing in something
terrible to happen.

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:36.181 align:middle line:84%
Now in choosing the terrible,
we always choose the known.

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:36.682 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:36.682 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: We're
always choosing the most --

00:28:39.284 --> 00:28:40.919 align:middle line:84%
we're choosing that known
because it's based on our past.

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:43.288 align:middle line:90%
I say let's expect the unknown.

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:44.756 align:middle line:90%
Let's expect the unexpected.

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:45.924 align:middle line:90%
Let's choose a potential

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:48.694 align:middle line:84%
in the field that's an
unknown and it exists.

00:28:48.694 --> 00:28:51.063 align:middle line:84%
It literally exists
as a possibility.

00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:52.698 align:middle line:90%
>> So what happened to the field

00:28:52.698 --> 00:28:56.268 align:middle line:84%
when Angelina Jolie made her
decision to do what she did?

00:28:56.268 --> 00:28:57.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: [laughter]

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that was a lot
of info put into the field.

00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:01.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Listen,
just because you carry a gene

00:29:01.607 --> 00:29:03.775 align:middle line:84%
for a certain thing doesn't
necessary mean you're going

00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:05.143 align:middle line:90%
to have the condition.

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:06.278 align:middle line:90%
>> It's going to express, yeah.

00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:07.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Yeah.

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:08.614 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's just
premature choice.

00:29:08.614 --> 00:29:11.617 align:middle line:84%
Now if you have a fear that
it's going to happen well then

00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:15.487 align:middle line:84%
that may be the right choice
but gosh darn it, in our studies

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:17.723 align:middle line:84%
of spontaneous remissions
and the people that have gone

00:29:17.723 --> 00:29:20.892 align:middle line:84%
through our workshops,
we've seen cancer disappear

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:90%
in a very short amount of time.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:22.861 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming --

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:23.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
-- a morphogenic field.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.897 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people
with MS and Lupus

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.266 align:middle line:84%
and Celiac disease,
it goes away.

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:32.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So
if you're genes turn on

00:29:32.404 --> 00:29:34.539 align:middle line:84%
and off they up regulate
and they down regulate,

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:41.413 align:middle line:84%
if 1561 genes can turn on
in eight weeks from people

00:29:41.413 --> 00:29:45.917 align:middle line:84%
that have -- that do a simple
relaxation yoga meditation,

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes to 30 minutes 1561
genes, over 800 of them turn

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:55.427 align:middle line:84%
on healthy genes turn on and
about 670 something turn off

00:29:55.427 --> 00:29:58.296 align:middle line:84%
that are the stress related
genes and then we know then

00:29:58.296 --> 00:29:59.898 align:middle line:90%
that genes then are just on a

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:84%
moment to moment
basis are changing

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.435 align:middle line:84%
but if you're thinking
the same way,

00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:04.770 align:middle line:90%
you're choosing the same way,

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.605 align:middle line:84%
you're behaving the same way
you're experiencing the same

00:30:06.605 --> 00:30:07.439 align:middle line:90%
thing --

00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:08.774 align:middle line:90%
>> And you're doing a hard buy

00:30:08.774 --> 00:30:10.942 align:middle line:84%
in that genetics indicate
absolute illness in your future.

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:11.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
It's just not true.

00:30:11.877 --> 00:30:12.944 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not true.

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:14.112 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
It's just not the truth.

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:16.415 align:middle line:90%
>> No. So there we go on that.

00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:19.317 align:middle line:84%
Now so if we're looking at
ill health then we're looking

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:20.952 align:middle line:90%
at patterns that have been --

00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:23.321 align:middle line:84%
these are not random things
that happen to the body.

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:27.125 align:middle line:84%
This has occurred mostly
through your buy in, as you say,

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:30.128 align:middle line:84%
on an emotional, mental,
subconscious level

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:31.797 align:middle line:84%
to where you're now
expressing something

00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:33.932 align:middle line:84%
of a lower nature
in the physical?

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:34.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Okay.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.401 align:middle line:84%
Well let's talk about
that because I want

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:37.636 align:middle line:90%
to answer it in two ways.

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Just
because I don't want to sound

00:30:40.105 --> 00:30:43.108 align:middle line:84%
like there's a panacea
that I'm addressing.

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:44.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:45.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: I want
to talk about knowledge

00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:48.647 align:middle line:84%
and information so for
the most part, you know,

00:30:48.647 --> 00:30:51.683 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
definition of genes.

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:54.152 align:middle line:90%
Genes allow us to make proteins.

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have a gene that makes
muscle cells make muscle protein

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.927 align:middle line:84%
so [inaudible] skin cells make
skin proteins called collagen

00:31:01.927 --> 00:31:05.764 align:middle line:84%
and elastin and stomach cells
make stomach proteins pepsin,

00:31:05.764 --> 00:31:08.433 align:middle line:84%
etc., etc. So the body is a
protein producing machine.

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:10.969 align:middle line:84%
But in order for the body to
make proteins for structure

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:13.405 align:middle line:84%
and function the gene
has to be expressed

00:31:13.405 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:90%
to make those proteins.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.043 align:middle line:84%
Right? So we express one and
a half percent of our genes.

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:20.946 align:middle line:84%
The other 98 and a half
percent is called junk DNA.

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:23.815 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact if you took
a skin cell and you stretched

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:27.452 align:middle line:84%
out the genes of a skin cell
it would be six feet tall.

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:30.589 align:middle line:84%
If you took out all the genetic
material out of your entire body

00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and you stretched it
out from end to end,

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.826 align:middle line:84%
it would go to the sun
and back 150 times.

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.561 align:middle line:84%
If you put all the
genetic material

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:38.263 align:middle line:84%
out of the 7 billion
people on the planet

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:41.466 align:middle line:84%
and you scrunched it together
it would fit on a grain of rice.

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:45.637 align:middle line:84%
Now genes are a parts
list of potentials.

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.906 align:middle line:84%
They're libraries
of possibilities.

00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:49.975 align:middle line:84%
Out of the one and a
half percent of the genes

00:31:49.975 --> 00:31:53.145 align:middle line:84%
that you express
your 98% chimpanzee.

00:31:53.145 --> 00:31:57.582 align:middle line:84%
You're only a few hundred genes
away from a chimp, 70% rat.

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.985 align:middle line:84%
Some more than others
but roughly 70%.

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:90%
People don't understand

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.524 align:middle line:84%
that genes are not the
answer to who they are.

00:32:05.524 --> 00:32:09.094 align:middle line:84%
You have 100,000
proteins in your body.

00:32:09.094 --> 00:32:11.963 align:middle line:84%
You have 40,000 regulatory
proteins

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:15.433 align:middle line:84%
that make those proteins so then
we should have 140,000 genes

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.536 align:middle line:90%
that make 140,000 proteins.

00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:19.204 align:middle line:90%
The answer is we don't.

00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:22.107 align:middle line:84%
We have 25,000 genes
that make that many.

00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:25.277 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking about
variations, combination,

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:28.747 align:middle line:84%
sequences and patterns and when
you look at this more closely,

00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:33.285 align:middle line:84%
one gene can have 35,000
different variations.

00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:34.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:32:34.386 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
So now we're talking

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.455 align:middle line:84%
about this whole phenomenon
that's very non-linear.

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:40.125 align:middle line:84%
So there are networks and
components and communities

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:43.094 align:middle line:84%
of connections about how genes
begin to express themselves.

00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:47.599 align:middle line:84%
So when you confront or
address adversity or difficulty

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:51.169 align:middle line:84%
in your life, if you're
addressing that adversity

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:53.839 align:middle line:84%
and doing the same thing that
creates the same experience,

00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:56.141 align:middle line:84%
the same experience
produces the same emotion

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:59.144 align:middle line:84%
and the same emotion signals
the same gene in the same way.

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you're angry at your
ex-husband, if you're judgmental

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.484 align:middle line:84%
of your coworker, if
you're inpatient in traffic,

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:09.821 align:middle line:84%
every single day then it's
the same information coming

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:90%
from the environment chemically.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.559 align:middle line:84%
Now as the organisms
and evolution

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:18.263 align:middle line:84%
if there's an organism that's
embracing cold conditions

00:33:18.263 --> 00:33:22.701 align:middle line:84%
or heat or altitude or
current or predator and pray.

00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:24.202 align:middle line:90%
As the organism is exposed

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:26.037 align:middle line:84%
to those environmental
conditions they have

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.906 align:middle line:84%
to change the behaviors
in order to survive.

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:29.107 align:middle line:90%
They have to adapt.

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:30.575 align:middle line:84%
So if they change
their behaviors

00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:31.943 align:middle line:90%
and they have a new experience,

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:84%
a new experience is producing
a new chemical expression.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.448 align:middle line:90%
So now as the organism begins

00:33:36.448 --> 00:33:40.452 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the environmental
conditions, over a series

00:33:40.452 --> 00:33:42.654 align:middle line:84%
of exposures to the same
environmental conditions

00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:43.989 align:middle line:90%
by changing their behaviors,

00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:46.157 align:middle line:84%
the new experiences produce
new chemical feedback

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:47.759 align:middle line:84%
from the environment
that signals the gene

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:50.962 align:middle line:84%
and if it's cold the
organism grows thicker fur.

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:51.763 align:middle line:90%
Fur is a protein.

00:33:51.763 --> 00:33:53.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:54.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: If it's
altitude hemoglobin bonds

00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:55.333 align:middle line:90%
to oxygen more.

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:56.134 align:middle line:90%
That's a protein.

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:33:57.469 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: If it's
a current a bigger tail fin.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.739 align:middle line:84%
If it's predator and
pray, longer legs.

00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:03.808 align:middle line:84%
So the bodies begin to adapt to
the environmental conditions.

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:05.810 align:middle line:90%
So then if you're living

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.114 align:middle line:84%
by the same emotions every
single day you're keeping the

00:34:09.114 --> 00:34:12.117 align:middle line:84%
same genes turned on and
the other genes turned off

00:34:12.117 --> 00:34:14.185 align:middle line:84%
and you're headed to
you genetic destiny.

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:18.056 align:middle line:84%
Now throw in those limited
emotions of anger and survival

00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.725 align:middle line:84%
and depression and hatred
and judgment and unworthiness

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:23.128 align:middle line:84%
and guilt now you're
dysregulating the gene

00:34:23.128 --> 00:34:26.097 align:middle line:84%
and now you're more
matter and less energy.

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:29.734 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the body
is becoming more dense

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:33.271 align:middle line:84%
and if the denser the body
becomes the more we're subject

00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:36.608 align:middle line:84%
to the laws of thermal
dynamics, which is matter tends

00:34:36.608 --> 00:34:38.043 align:middle line:90%
to break down in time.

00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:38.443 align:middle line:90%
Disorder.

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:39.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Right?

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:40.911 align:middle line:84%
The second law of
thermodynamics.

00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:42.614 align:middle line:90%
Change your energy then.

00:34:42.614 --> 00:34:44.783 align:middle line:84%
And now if you can really
change the level of energy

00:34:44.783 --> 00:34:47.452 align:middle line:84%
that creates a level of
coherence and you begin

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:50.989 align:middle line:84%
to learn new knowledge you
begin to wire it in your brain,

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.925 align:middle line:84%
you demonstrate that knowledge
you create a new experience,

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:56.061 align:middle line:84%
a new experience
creates a new emotion

00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:58.663 align:middle line:84%
and now you're teaching your
body emotionally what your mind

00:34:58.663 --> 00:35:00.265 align:middle line:90%
has intellectually understood.

00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.267 align:middle line:84%
You're embodying
knowledge in that moment.

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:03.835 align:middle line:84%
You're signaling new
genes in new ways.

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:07.072 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're creating one of
the 35,000 potential effects

00:35:07.072 --> 00:35:08.106 align:middle line:90%
for [laughter] that one gene.

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:08.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Another variation.

00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:09.641 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just amazing.

00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:90%
It is miraculous.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Now think about this.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the latest research
shows that our genes

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.048 align:middle line:84%
and our receptors
in our cells are

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:19.017 align:middle line:84%
at least 100 times
more sensitive

00:35:19.017 --> 00:35:20.919 align:middle line:84%
to electromagnetism
to electricity --

00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:21.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:22.754 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --

00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:24.122 align:middle line:84%
to energy than they are
to chemistry and that

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:26.524 align:middle line:84%
when you get the hair on the
back of your neck standing up

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:29.461 align:middle line:84%
and you feel empowered, and
you feel enriched and you feel,

00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:90%
you know, enthusiastic,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:84%
boy oh boy the cells are getting
new information in that moment.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.435 align:middle line:84%
You've come out of your
resting state and you go

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:90%
from particle to wave.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.473 align:middle line:84%
And when your heart opens, the
field goes from a few inches

00:35:41.473 --> 00:35:43.975 align:middle line:84%
around your body to nine
meters around your body.

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:47.445 align:middle line:84%
Now you're saying there's
potentials in the quantum field

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:49.748 align:middle line:84%
that I want to tune into
but in order for you to do

00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
emulate the divine.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.786 align:middle line:84%
>> You have laid a lovely
foundation to now get

00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:56.721 align:middle line:84%
into the subject of
the placebo effect.

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:57.655 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:35:57.655 --> 00:35:58.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Are we talking

00:35:58.456 --> 00:35:59.457 align:middle line:90%
about the placebo effect?

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:01.459 align:middle line:84%
>> A very thorough,
lovely foundation.

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:03.294 align:middle line:90%
Yes we do need to go there.

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:04.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
All right, so --

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:07.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. And I want to have
some really good juicy examples

00:36:07.132 --> 00:36:10.468 align:middle line:84%
of the potentials, startling
examples of what can happen.

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:13.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: All right
so I love talking about this

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.706 align:middle line:90%
because it suggests possibility.

00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:19.411 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a great story
of a guy that in the mid 1900s,

00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:22.781 align:middle line:84%
early 1900s that
went to his doctor

00:36:22.781 --> 00:36:25.917 align:middle line:84%
and they did all the exams
on him and they told him

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:31.256 align:middle line:84%
that he had end stage 4th
stage esophageal cancer

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:34.192 align:middle line:84%
and that he had six
months to live

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:36.094 align:middle line:90%
and to get his affairs in order.

00:36:36.094 --> 00:36:38.797 align:middle line:84%
So the guy goes home,
announces to his family

00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that he's got end
stage esophageal

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.368 align:middle line:90%
and he's got six months to live.

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.470 align:middle line:84%
His family starts treating
him in certain ways,

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.039 align:middle line:90%
they're preparing him to die.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:50.308 align:middle line:90%
Of course in just a few days

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:53.244 align:middle line:84%
over six months he
dies of -- he dies.

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they do an autopsy
on his body and they find

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.483 align:middle line:90%
out he has no esophageal cancer.

00:36:58.483 --> 00:37:00.085 align:middle line:90%
So if you think about that --

00:37:00.085 --> 00:37:01.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:01.286 --> 00:37:03.121 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --
he died by thought alone.

00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:04.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:05.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: He
tuned in to that possibility

00:37:05.657 --> 00:37:08.993 align:middle line:84%
in the field, emotionally
embraced what it would be like,

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:11.896 align:middle line:84%
lived as if -- that's
a state of being --

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:15.266 align:middle line:84%
and his body was
drawn to that destiny.

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Okay? Now you take
another experiment

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.239 align:middle line:84%
where you take a
group of patients

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:23.741 align:middle line:84%
that have Parkinson's
disease, okay,

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:27.412 align:middle line:84%
and Parkinson's disease is
a deficiency in dopamine

00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:29.347 align:middle line:84%
and the brain can't
make dopamine.

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.715 align:middle line:84%
And when there's
not enough dopamine

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:33.585 align:middle line:84%
in the brain there's
involuntary tremors.

00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:36.254 align:middle line:84%
In other words there's
a tremor or pill rolling

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:39.757 align:middle line:84%
or what's called steppage gait
or festination gait, the body --

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:42.227 align:middle line:84%
the upper motor neurons
cause the body to go

00:37:42.227 --> 00:37:43.761 align:middle line:90%
into spastic paralysis.

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:45.763 align:middle line:84%
Right? So they did
this experiment

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:48.399 align:middle line:84%
where they took people
and they said okay listen,

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:52.036 align:middle line:84%
we got this really great
hot new drug and they pull

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:54.739 align:middle line:84%
out this big needle and
it's a saline injection.

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It's salt and they say to them
look okay, now we're going

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.246 align:middle line:84%
to give you this injection and
more than 50% of the people

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:90%
that got the injection,

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.216 align:middle line:84%
all of their involuntary
tremors went away.

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:07.118 align:middle line:90%
In other words disappeared.

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:10.288 align:middle line:84%
So now they were no longer
having any imbalances physically

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:11.623 align:middle line:90%
in their body.

00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:13.391 align:middle line:84%
So the doctors that did
the experiment said well,

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:14.559 align:middle line:90%
that's just the placebo effect.

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they said well
what is the placebo?

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:22.033 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was they took
a radioactive dye that competes

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:24.903 align:middle line:84%
with receptor sites in
the brain for dopamine.

00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:27.071 align:middle line:84%
So if the person is
making their own dopamine

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and they inject the
radioactive die that goes

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.909 align:middle line:90%
into those receptor sites,

00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:34.078 align:middle line:84%
when they photograph the brain
there should be no radioactive

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:35.713 align:middle line:84%
dye in the brain because
dopamine is in there.

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:37.715 align:middle line:84%
If they're not making
their own dopamine

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:39.684 align:middle line:84%
and they shoot the
radioactive dye in there,

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:42.253 align:middle line:84%
you can see all the brain light
up because it's competing --

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:45.557 align:middle line:84%
it's filling the receptor
sites for dopamine.

00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:48.593 align:middle line:84%
So when they did
the test they found

00:38:48.593 --> 00:38:52.363 align:middle line:84%
out that those people were
making their own dopamine.

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:55.967 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they moved
into a new state of being.

00:38:55.967 --> 00:38:59.270 align:middle line:84%
They got the injection, they
thought that they were well.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.105 align:middle line:84%
As they began to think
that they were well began

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:02.240 align:middle line:90%
to act like they were well.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.942 align:middle line:84%
When they were acting
like they were well,

00:39:03.942 --> 00:39:06.744 align:middle line:84%
they began to embrace what
it would feel like to be well

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:08.446 align:middle line:84%
and how you think and
feel is a state of being.

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.048 align:middle line:90%
That's a belief.

00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:12.550 align:middle line:84%
In a matter of moments
they were being well.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.854 align:middle line:84%
Now the moment you're being
something, the intelligence

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:19.591 align:middle line:84%
that gives you light that's both
within you and all around you,

00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:22.594 align:middle line:84%
personal and universal
endorses who you're being.

00:39:22.594 --> 00:39:26.264 align:middle line:84%
So the intelligence
says oh, he's being

00:39:26.264 --> 00:39:29.867 align:middle line:84%
or she's being healthy
so now I have

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:33.605 align:middle line:84%
to make the internal chemistry
to reflect the state of being.

00:39:33.605 --> 00:39:35.907 align:middle line:84%
So they started making
their own dopamine.

00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:37.542 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the caveat.

00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:43.047 align:middle line:84%
The caveat is that the
results only lasted

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.782 align:middle line:84%
for a little time,
like a day or so.

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:45.917 align:middle line:90%
Maybe two days.

00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:47.585 align:middle line:84%
And some people say,
well why would that be?

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:51.189 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment the person
returned back into their same --

00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:52.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:53.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- present
life, they saw their wife,

00:39:53.925 --> 00:39:56.394 align:middle line:84%
they saw their husband, they saw
the caregiver, they saw the bed,

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:58.263 align:middle line:84%
they played chess with
the guys who complained

00:39:58.263 --> 00:39:59.130 align:middle line:90%
about their conditions.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.431 align:middle line:90%
The moment

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:03.368 align:middle line:84%
they got back into their
environment the environment was

00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:06.604 align:middle line:84%
so strong that by
association just like --

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:07.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --
Pavlov ringing the bell

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.609 align:middle line:84%
and salivating the body
physiologically returned back

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:12.744 align:middle line:90%
to the old state of being.

00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:14.279 align:middle line:90%
But here's the question.

00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:17.448 align:middle line:84%
If meditation is about
going from thinking to being

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
it's really about.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.818 align:middle line:84%
You can't get up as the
same person who sat down.

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:23.254 align:middle line:84%
You have to get up
as somebody else.

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:26.658 align:middle line:84%
If that's what meditation
is about then could you move

00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:29.961 align:middle line:84%
into a state of being and
instead of putting your belief

00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:84%
into sugar pill or
a saline injection

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.333 align:middle line:84%
because all they did was
accept the potential,

00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:84%
could you then put your
attention into the unknown

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.439 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility of
quantum field and move

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.474 align:middle line:90%
into a state of being everyday?

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:47.345 align:middle line:84%
And if it only lasts for a day
because that environment is

00:40:47.345 --> 00:40:50.982 align:middle line:84%
that powerful, wouldn't it
be a good idea then to get

00:40:50.982 --> 00:40:53.251 align:middle line:84%
up every morning in a
different state of being

00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:57.622 align:middle line:84%
and create an elevated level
of energy to open your heart

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:01.659 align:middle line:84%
and experience goodwill and
gratitude before the event

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:05.797 align:middle line:84%
to be inspired and enthusiastic
and marry it with possibility

00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:08.999 align:middle line:84%
and get up from that state
of being and then maintain

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.969 align:middle line:84%
that modified state of
mind your entire day

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:14.205 align:middle line:84%
so that the experience
of your meditation turns

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:15.740 align:middle line:90%
into a good mood.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.774 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:17.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Turns into a good --

00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:18.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Answer's yes --

00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:19.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
-- good temperament.

00:41:19.377 --> 00:41:19.777 align:middle line:84%
>> -- that would
be a good thing.

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:21.145 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:21.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: And then
into a good personality trait.

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So then the
question is, can you teach it?

00:41:25.717 --> 00:41:26.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Right. Can you teach it?

00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:28.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Do
you need the sugar pill?

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:29.921 align:middle line:90%
Can you teach it?

00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:31.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. So yeah, and
let's talk about that

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:34.726 align:middle line:84%
because what happens -- I mean
we've all heard of the famous,

00:41:34.726 --> 00:41:38.262 align:middle line:84%
in the past, the faith healers
the evangelists going around

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:40.231 align:middle line:84%
and there would be these
spontaneous healings,

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:84%
many of which were
permanent with the people

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.905 align:middle line:84%
because they had faith in that
particular charismatic leader,

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:52.143 align:middle line:84%
God, whatever their form of
faith was they had faith in that

00:41:52.143 --> 00:41:55.847 align:middle line:84%
above anything else including
above the field of medicine

00:41:55.847 --> 00:42:00.651 align:middle line:84%
so the faith was so deep that
the remission was allowed

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:03.588 align:middle line:84%
to happen by faith alone,
but if you go beyond that --

00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:04.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: What
is the definition of faith?

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:06.824 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the definition of
faith because we are taught

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:08.993 align:middle line:84%
to believe in everything
other than ourselves.

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:11.496 align:middle line:84%
Must believe in the medical
profession, pharmaceutical.

00:42:11.496 --> 00:42:13.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: The current
witchdoctor is wearing a lab

00:42:13.231 --> 00:42:13.931 align:middle line:90%
coat and stethoscope.

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:17.535 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. That's the witchdoctor
which we've been trained

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:19.937 align:middle line:84%
to believe in so we have to
have the faith to overcome

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:21.906 align:middle line:84%
and believe our own
system is stronger, right?

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.441 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So my
definition of faith is believing

00:42:23.441 --> 00:42:26.077 align:middle line:84%
in thought more than
anything else.

00:42:26.077 --> 00:42:26.544 align:middle line:90%
And when you --

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:27.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:28.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
We all do this.

00:42:28.446 --> 00:42:28.913 align:middle line:84%
You get in trouble
in your life --

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:30.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- you get
into a crisis, you've got --

00:42:31.249 --> 00:42:32.617 align:middle line:84%
something goes wrong
in your life,

00:42:32.617 --> 00:42:35.453 align:middle line:84%
everybody does the same thing,
they retreat from their life.

00:42:35.453 --> 00:42:37.255 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to see anybody,
they don't want to go anywhere,

00:42:37.255 --> 00:42:38.456 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to
talk to anybody.

00:42:38.456 --> 00:42:40.558 align:middle line:84%
They want to eliminate
their environment.

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.427 align:middle line:84%
They want to go into --
eliminate their body,

00:42:42.427 --> 00:42:45.463 align:middle line:84%
they want to focus on a
possibility in a quantum field.

00:42:45.463 --> 00:42:48.232 align:middle line:84%
They want to begin to become
aware of who they no longer want

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.467 align:middle line:84%
to be and who they
do want to be.

00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:50.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:50.835 --> 00:42:53.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: And that
process when you are injured

00:42:53.638 --> 00:42:56.808 align:middle line:84%
or damaged or you're altered
in some way that dark night

00:42:56.808 --> 00:42:59.911 align:middle line:84%
of the soul is because you're
no longer feeling like yourself

00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:01.179 align:middle line:84%
because you're no
longer yourself and now

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that you're no longer
yourself you can see yourself

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.248 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.817 align:middle line:84%
>> But it takes trauma
oftentimes to bring that state.

00:43:05.817 --> 00:43:07.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: That's the
old model, current condition.

00:43:07.652 --> 00:43:11.656 align:middle line:84%
So then when we get to
that point where we're all

00:43:11.656 --> 00:43:14.192 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden now becoming
conscious of who we are again

00:43:14.192 --> 00:43:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and we're eliminating
the environment.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.029 align:middle line:84%
We're selecting the
potential in the quantum field

00:43:18.029 --> 00:43:20.431 align:middle line:84%
and we're saying this
is what I'm intending on

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.467 align:middle line:84%
and we obsess about
that intention.

00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:25.069 align:middle line:84%
We keep thinking --
we're wired to do this.

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:26.137 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're wired to do.

00:43:26.137 --> 00:43:27.271 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
Now you may say, well,

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:30.975 align:middle line:90%
you know, what is that prayer?

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:33.578 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what you call
it, but when you believe

00:43:33.578 --> 00:43:36.781 align:middle line:84%
in your internal paradigm,
your internal vision

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:40.251 align:middle line:84%
and you're making it more
real than your external world

00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:43.221 align:middle line:84%
and you are emotionally
embracing it, not just hoping,

00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:46.491 align:middle line:84%
not just wanting but you have to
emotionally embrace the outcome.

00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:47.458 align:middle line:90%
That's the element.

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:48.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:49.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
You have to bring

00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:50.328 align:middle line:84%
up the feeling before
it's made to manifest.

00:43:50.328 --> 00:43:51.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:52.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
You can't say

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.264 align:middle line:84%
when my new lover comes
I'm going to be happy --

00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:53.898 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the missing part.

00:43:53.898 --> 00:43:54.665 align:middle line:90%
Words don't do it.

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Right.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.934 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't say
you know, when my --

00:43:56.934 --> 00:43:59.637 align:middle line:84%
you know when I'm healed
I'll finally give thanks

00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:02.006 align:middle line:84%
or when my wealth shows up
then I'll be inspired --

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:04.475 align:middle line:84%
that's the Newtonian model of
reality of cause and effect

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:06.644 align:middle line:84%
and the quantum model
of reality says you have

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:08.446 align:middle line:84%
to teach your body
emotionally what it feels

00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:09.780 align:middle line:90%
like ahead of the actual event.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:12.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: You have to
literally change the circuitry

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:14.752 align:middle line:84%
in your brain to look like
the experience has happened

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.954 align:middle line:84%
and you have to emotionally
condition your body

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:19.023 align:middle line:84%
into giving it a
taste of the future

00:44:19.023 --> 00:44:20.525 align:middle line:84%
so that your body's
physically changed.

00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:25.196 align:middle line:84%
Now if your brain and body
are physically changed to look

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:28.132 align:middle line:84%
like the experience
has happened,

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:84%
relax because the experience has
already happened and it's going

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:35.473 align:middle line:84%
to find you and it's
going to come in a way

00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:37.108 align:middle line:90%
that you least expect.

00:44:37.108 --> 00:44:40.278 align:middle line:84%
Now why does it have to come
in a way that you least expect?

00:44:40.278 --> 00:44:42.813 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can expect
it, it's nothing new.

00:44:42.813 --> 00:44:44.282 align:middle line:90%
It's got to rock your world.

00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:45.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:46.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: It's
got to catch you off guard.

00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:49.253 align:middle line:84%
It has to leave no doubt
that what you did inside

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:52.123 align:middle line:84%
of you produced some
result outside of you

00:44:52.123 --> 00:44:54.959 align:middle line:84%
and when you can correlate
the changes you've made inside

00:44:54.959 --> 00:44:57.562 align:middle line:84%
of you with the effects
that you produced outside

00:44:57.562 --> 00:44:59.630 align:middle line:84%
of you you'll pay
attention to what you did

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and you'll do it again and
that's called causing an effect.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.938 align:middle line:84%
And that level of empowerment is
what every human being is after.

00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:08.306 align:middle line:90%
It's not the car.

00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:11.642 align:middle line:84%
It's not the SUV, it's not the
lover, it's not the vacation,

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:13.744 align:middle line:84%
it's the fact that you
created it from your mind

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:16.247 align:middle line:84%
and when you get a
taste of that and all

00:45:16.247 --> 00:45:19.517 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden the material
things become incidental

00:45:19.517 --> 00:45:21.953 align:middle line:84%
because now you're going to
want to experience the mystical.

00:45:21.953 --> 00:45:23.888 align:middle line:84%
You're going to want to
understand and unravel --

00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:25.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:26.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- the
mystery of who you really are.

00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:29.393 align:middle line:84%
That's the excitement then
because you're no longer seduced

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:32.430 align:middle line:84%
by the shampoos and
the cars and the beers

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.098 align:middle line:84%
and whatever else people
think they need to have.

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And every human
being is capable,

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.368 align:middle line:90%
innately capable of doing this.

00:45:37.368 --> 00:45:39.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: I always
say nobody's so special --

00:45:39.604 --> 00:45:41.038 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:41.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- to be
excluded from the quantum law.

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:43.975 align:middle line:90%
Now think about antiquity.

00:45:43.975 --> 00:45:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Gender, race, color,
social status --

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:45:50.448 --> 00:45:51.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --
intellectual ability,

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:56.454 align:middle line:84%
religion has all
disseminated and divided people

00:45:56.454 --> 00:45:59.457 align:middle line:84%
in their ignorance they
think they have to go

00:45:59.457 --> 00:46:00.891 align:middle line:90%
through someone to get there.

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:01.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:03.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
We come preloaded

00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:05.429 align:middle line:90%
with all the biological

00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:07.465 align:middle line:84%
and neurological
machinery to do this.

00:46:07.465 --> 00:46:08.833 align:middle line:90%
We are divine creators.

00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:10.234 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:13.404 align:middle line:84%
And if you're waking up
everyday and getting out of bed

00:46:13.404 --> 00:46:15.573 align:middle line:84%
and doing the same thing
and going to the same place

00:46:15.573 --> 00:46:18.342 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the same people
at the exact same time

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:20.344 align:middle line:84%
and then allowing
the same people

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:23.014 align:middle line:84%
to push the same emotional
buttons then it's your

00:46:23.014 --> 00:46:24.248 align:middle line:90%
external environment.

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:25.916 align:middle line:84%
Your environment's controlling
how you think and feel.

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:27.351 align:middle line:84%
You're victim to
your environment.

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:29.720 align:middle line:84%
The point the model says change
how you think and feel and see

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.589 align:middle line:84%
if you can put into
effect in your environment.

00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:36.093 align:middle line:84%
Now when you get to this point,
I don't care if you're the CEO

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of a major company or
prison inmate or the janitor

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.799 align:middle line:84%
in the school or
the schoolteacher,

00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:44.435 align:middle line:84%
everybody secretly
believes in their greatness.

00:46:44.435 --> 00:46:47.772 align:middle line:84%
They do. They secretly believe
that they can do a better job

00:46:47.772 --> 00:46:51.876 align:middle line:84%
in life and when we get to
that point of consciousness,

00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:53.611 align:middle line:90%
becoming conscious, right?

00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:58.049 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what paradigm you
accept, but the bottom line is,

00:46:58.049 --> 00:47:03.120 align:middle line:84%
is that there is some aspect
of us at cause in our life.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:08.125 align:middle line:84%
That's the new model of reality
and so when you truly are

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.561 align:middle line:84%
in a state of creation,
guess what?

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:13.030 align:middle line:84%
You're not your face,
you're not your body,

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.399 align:middle line:84%
you're not your identity,
you're not your breasts,

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:18.569 align:middle line:84%
you're not a mother, you're not
a wife, you're not your car,

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:21.906 align:middle line:84%
you're not your house,
you're not living

00:47:21.906 --> 00:47:24.408 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime in linear time.

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:27.611 align:middle line:84%
In order to get to the
field of possibility,

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.413 align:middle line:84%
you have to become
pure consciousness,

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:31.582 align:middle line:84%
you have to become
nobody, no one,

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:33.617 align:middle line:90%
no thing, no where and no time.

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:37.588 align:middle line:84%
And when we dissociate from this
present reality, we just walk

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.457 align:middle line:84%
through to the door
to the quantum field.

00:47:39.457 --> 00:47:41.292 align:middle line:90%
You can't enter as a somebody.

00:47:41.292 --> 00:47:42.593 align:middle line:90%
You have to enter as a nobody.

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:45.629 align:middle line:84%
And that means then by
our very nature you have

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:47.064 align:middle line:90%
to become pure consciousness

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:51.068 align:middle line:84%
and when you are then you have
dominion to change your body.

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:54.371 align:middle line:84%
Now you have the ability to
create something in your life

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:57.942 align:middle line:84%
in your environment and you
transcend or create another time

00:47:57.942 --> 00:48:00.044 align:middle line:90%
so it's kind of a paradox.

00:48:00.044 --> 00:48:00.544 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it funny --

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:01.612 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:02.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
-- that in order for us

00:48:02.947 --> 00:48:03.614 align:middle line:84%
to create a new life, we have
to forget about our life.

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:04.081 align:middle line:90%
>> [laughter] Yeah.

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:05.449 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: We have to
forget about all of who we are.

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:07.952 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk about
the nuts and bolts of it.

00:48:07.952 --> 00:48:12.556 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at being
able to access the no thing

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:14.425 align:middle line:90%
and no one aspect of self.

00:48:14.425 --> 00:48:17.828 align:middle line:84%
The non-linear, beyond
space and time template

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:20.664 align:middle line:84%
that has the ability to create
any outcome we want, really.

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about that
within the context of healing

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.369 align:middle line:90%
and beyond the placebo effect

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:28.239 align:middle line:84%
because no placebo effect
should become a worn out term.

00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Um-hmm.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, we do need
to move beyond it.

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:31.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Sure.

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.544 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just the effect
not the placebo effect.

00:48:33.544 --> 00:48:35.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Well
how much time do we have?

00:48:35.546 --> 00:48:38.215 align:middle line:90%
>> We have about ten minutes.

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:39.583 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Well this
is interesting because when we -

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.852 align:middle line:90%
look, after "What the Bleep",

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:45.689 align:middle line:84%
you know the most common thing
we heard was how do you do it?

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:49.927 align:middle line:84%
You know? So we started teaching
these workshops around the world

00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:52.129 align:middle line:84%
and we were teaching
people how to do it

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:55.099 align:middle line:84%
and for two years we really
didn't produce much results.

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:57.268 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a lot of
results and after two years all

00:48:57.268 --> 00:48:58.936 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden the flood
gates opened.

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.404 align:middle line:90%
We started getting emails.

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:03.107 align:middle line:84%
And of course the very first
line of every email that we got

00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:06.544 align:middle line:84%
and it's still the same to
this day is you're not going

00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:07.711 align:middle line:90%
to believe this.

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:09.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
line of every email.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.116 align:middle line:84%
Hey I gave up my anger and
my acid reflux went away.

00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:13.250 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I got this job.

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.586 align:middle line:84%
I'm making $40,000 more
than I was last year,

00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:17.855 align:middle line:84%
I'm traveling along the west
coast, I got all expenses --

00:49:17.855 --> 00:49:19.690 align:middle line:84%
you know all of these
-- I won the lottery.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.759 align:middle line:84%
You know, all of a sudden we
started getting this flood gate

00:49:21.759 --> 00:49:24.595 align:middle line:84%
of all these possibilities where
people were manifesting reality.

00:49:24.595 --> 00:49:26.564 align:middle line:84%
So we knew then that we
were getting feedback

00:49:26.564 --> 00:49:27.731 align:middle line:84%
that we were doing
something right.

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:30.167 align:middle line:84%
So we started teaching
more advanced workshops

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and then this crazy
thing happened.

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.172 align:middle line:84%
We started having people
getting healed right during our

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:37.775 align:middle line:84%
workshops, MS, Lupus,
Celiac disease,

00:49:37.775 --> 00:49:39.543 align:middle line:84%
high blood pressure
chronic pain --

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:41.078 align:middle line:84%
>> How could you
quantify that at the time?

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:42.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Well
they would stand up and say,

00:49:42.246 --> 00:49:44.048 align:middle line:84%
oh my God you know
something shifted in me --

00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:45.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:46.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
I'm eating hamburgers.

00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:47.885 align:middle line:84%
I was living on lettuce for the
last seven years of my life.

00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:50.788 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I've had chronic bladder
pain for the last 15 years.

00:49:50.788 --> 00:49:53.858 align:middle line:84%
I'm so I can't even take
antibiotics any longer

00:49:53.858 --> 00:49:55.559 align:middle line:90%
because I'm immune to them now.

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.094 align:middle line:90%
I have no bladder pain.

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:57.795 align:middle line:90%
I feel great.

00:49:57.795 --> 00:49:59.463 align:middle line:90%
You know, or you know --

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:00.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:50:00.865 --> 00:50:01.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- hey,
there's some shift, you know,

00:50:01.866 --> 00:50:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and then they send
us the lab results

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:03.901 align:middle line:90%
and of course we correlate it.

00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:05.102 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:06.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: It
was happening in realtime.

00:50:06.437 --> 00:50:08.472 align:middle line:84%
They were signaling new genes
in new ways in the event.

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:09.974 align:middle line:84%
Their body was literal
living in a [inaudible]

00:50:09.974 --> 00:50:11.108 align:middle line:90%
>> So people are saying

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:12.610 align:middle line:84%
to themselves what were
they teaching them?

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Well it
was amazing because we now knew

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:17.781 align:middle line:84%
that the placebo was working
but the only thing was

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:21.418 align:middle line:84%
that there was no sugar pill or
bread pill or saline injection.

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:22.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:24.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- they
were believing in themselves.

00:50:24.088 --> 00:50:26.223 align:middle line:84%
Okay? So what we said then
was look, if it's happening

00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:27.625 align:middle line:84%
in realtime we've
got to measure this.

00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:30.227 align:middle line:84%
Like we talked about last
time we brought in a team

00:50:30.227 --> 00:50:31.962 align:middle line:84%
of neuroscientists,
Jeffrey [phonetic] Fanin,

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:34.231 align:middle line:84%
we brought [inaudible]
Constantine, [phonetic] Karodcov

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:37.334 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted measurements
and I wanted to know.

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:40.271 align:middle line:84%
If we could see what
was going on --

00:50:40.271 --> 00:50:42.740 align:middle line:84%
look it's one thing to
say a person's better

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.742 align:middle line:84%
from Parkinson's
disease but let's see

00:50:44.742 --> 00:50:46.310 align:middle line:84%
if in fact their brain
is acting differently.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.012 align:middle line:84%
>> And last time we had
talked you had conducted the

00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:50.314 align:middle line:84%
experiments but you were
waiting for the data to come in.

00:50:50.314 --> 00:50:51.348 align:middle line:90%
I think it was just due.

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:52.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: All right.

00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Well let's cut through
some slides.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.851 align:middle line:90%
Let's cut through some slides.

00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:55.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. Let's do it.

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:56.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Okay.

00:50:56.487 --> 00:50:57.821 align:middle line:90%
So what we did first

00:50:57.821 --> 00:51:00.824 align:middle line:84%
and foremost is we measured
the ambient energy in the room.

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:02.626 align:middle line:84%
We had a little over
200 participants

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:03.827 align:middle line:90%
in this advanced workshop.

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:07.131 align:middle line:84%
It was a four day
workshop and we said okay,

00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:08.999 align:middle line:84%
let's measure the
electromagnetic field,

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:10.334 align:middle line:84%
let's measure the
space of the room,

00:51:10.334 --> 00:51:11.335 align:middle line:84%
and let's measure the
energy in the room.

00:51:11.335 --> 00:51:12.536 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's Constantine job.

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:13.871 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:15.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So we
measured the energy in the room

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:19.443 align:middle line:84%
and it was roughly 2800-joules
or so or 3800-joules.

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:23.080 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the 4 day workshop
it was over 5200-joules.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.281 align:middle line:90%
Now that is very --

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:25.549 align:middle line:90%
>> It started out as what?

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:27.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
38 and went up to 52.

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:28.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:51:28.786 --> 00:51:31.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So we had
a very, very substantial amount

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:34.825 align:middle line:84%
of energy, available
energy that's in that room.

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:37.895 align:middle line:84%
It was palpable by the
fourth day but we measured

00:51:37.895 --> 00:51:41.131 align:middle line:84%
and now we know there's more
energy less matter in the room.

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:42.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:43.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
We know that.

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:45.402 align:middle line:84%
So we talked to Constantine
about this and he said I have

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:47.972 align:middle line:84%
to present these results at my
conference because this is one

00:51:47.972 --> 00:51:50.841 align:middle line:84%
of the most dramatic
changes that we've ever seen

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:53.143 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to measuring
energy in the rooms.

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:55.312 align:middle line:84%
So we took people
through the process

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:58.182 align:middle line:84%
of examining their
past the first day

00:51:58.182 --> 00:52:02.486 align:middle line:84%
and when we studied them
examining their past their brain

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:05.956 align:middle line:84%
actually got worse because
most people when we look at --

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure. Because they're
swimming in that soup.

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:08.959 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:09.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: And the
energy in the room went down.

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Went down.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.328 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:11.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Because
they were recalling energy back

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:12.262 align:middle line:90%
to [inaudible]

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:13.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:14.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So when
I looked at the brain scans

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:16.066 align:middle line:84%
of people in the middle
of their meditation,

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.434 align:middle line:84%
they were using their brain
to try to change their brain.

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.236 align:middle line:84%
They were using the program
to try to change the program.

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:21.105 align:middle line:84%
They were using the ego
to try to change the ego

00:52:21.105 --> 00:52:23.907 align:middle line:84%
and the brain worked harder and
the brain wave patterns went up,

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:26.377 align:middle line:84%
and they got worse but then
when we started shifting

00:52:26.377 --> 00:52:27.878 align:middle line:90%
to the present moment and all

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.246 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden they were
calling energy back,

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:31.315 align:middle line:90%
the energy room started to rise.

00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:32.916 align:middle line:90%
By the third day we had --

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:36.053 align:middle line:84%
I watched during meditations
I watched the trip chart just

00:52:36.053 --> 00:52:38.455 align:middle line:84%
raise and this is
the result of it so.

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:39.757 align:middle line:90%
People were exuding energy.

00:52:39.757 --> 00:52:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Their body's energy went
from very small to very large

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.294 align:middle line:90%
and it was cluttering the room

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and was creating a
new morphogenic field.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:47.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:47.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
So there was a field

00:52:47.965 --> 00:52:48.966 align:middle line:90%
that was created there.

00:52:48.966 --> 00:52:50.734 align:middle line:84%
So we now know that
that happened.

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:54.805 align:middle line:90%
Now this is what a change

00:52:54.805 --> 00:52:56.573 align:middle line:84%
in coherence looks
like in the brain.

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:59.343 align:middle line:84%
If you look on the left
side, this person has a lot

00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:00.911 align:middle line:84%
of chatter going
on in their brain.

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Their brain is working
way too hard.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.648 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking
about everything.

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:06.617 align:middle line:84%
They're analyzing their
life within the emotions

00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:07.651 align:middle line:90%
that they're memorized.

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:09.653 align:middle line:84%
Their brain is in a
high arousal state.

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:13.257 align:middle line:84%
After one meditation, we
see a normal healthy brain.

00:53:13.257 --> 00:53:14.091 align:middle line:90%
As a matter of fact --

00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:15.259 align:middle line:90%
>> One looks agitated.

00:53:15.259 --> 00:53:16.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
One is very agitated.

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:17.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:53:17.728 --> 00:53:19.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So you
got two parts of the brain,

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:21.231 align:middle line:84%
two halves of the
brain communicating.

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.466 align:middle line:90%
That is a level of wholeness

00:53:22.466 --> 00:53:25.135 align:middle line:84%
where the person is
literally viewing their life

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.203 align:middle line:90%
from a different mind.

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Um-hmm.

00:53:27.438 --> 00:53:28.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Now
Constantine's work allows us

00:53:28.605 --> 00:53:31.241 align:middle line:84%
to measure the field
around the body

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:32.943 align:middle line:84%
but then the different
energy centers.

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.211 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to call
them chakras --

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:35.479 --> 00:53:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- but
I call them energy centers

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.748 align:middle line:84%
because they're literally
hormone centers

00:53:37.748 --> 00:53:40.117 align:middle line:84%
that carry nerve plexuses
or minds with them.

00:53:40.117 --> 00:53:41.819 align:middle line:90%
They're levels of consciousness.

00:53:41.819 --> 00:53:45.956 align:middle line:84%
So you can measure the person's
level of chakra balance based

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:50.294 align:middle line:84%
on their size of expression,
healthiness, robustness

00:53:50.294 --> 00:53:53.297 align:middle line:84%
and then the way we measure
whether they're working properly

00:53:53.297 --> 00:53:55.399 align:middle line:84%
is whether they're aligned
or we move them off.

00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:57.434 align:middle line:84%
So the weaker or more
imbalance they are,

00:53:57.434 --> 00:54:00.337 align:middle line:84%
the more removed they are
-- the more they move off.

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:02.639 align:middle line:84%
So we do a meditation at
the beginning of everyday

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:05.809 align:middle line:84%
to bless every one of these
centers with new information.

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:08.812 align:middle line:84%
At the end of one
meditation, you have to get

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.280 align:middle line:84%
into your autonomic
nervous system --

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:10.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that.

00:54:10.681 --> 00:54:12.082 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: -- to look
beyond your analytical mind.

00:54:13.117 --> 00:54:14.618 align:middle line:84%
You have to enter into
the subconscious system

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:15.919 align:middle line:90%
to make the change.

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.088 align:middle line:84%
Here's a person who's
energy is way off.

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:21.592 align:middle line:84%
After one meditation their
energy is more aligned

00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:24.294 align:middle line:84%
and you can see some
of those energy centers

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:25.362 align:middle line:90%
actually enlarged.

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:26.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:27.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Take
a look at this person.

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.532 align:middle line:90%
They're doing pretty good.

00:54:28.532 --> 00:54:30.968 align:middle line:84%
But after the meditation
they're doing really well.

00:54:30.968 --> 00:54:32.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. This is
amazing technology.

00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:35.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: This is
45 minutes of one meditation.

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Now look at the size of those
energy centers compared pre

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:40.377 align:middle line:90%
and post.

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:40.944 align:middle line:90%
You can see.

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that.

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:43.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
They're just more robust,

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.449 align:middle line:84%
they're more filled,
they're more heightened

00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:47.651 align:middle line:84%
and this person's going
to have a good day.

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:48.118 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:49.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So now is
a great way for us to measure.

00:54:51.822 --> 00:54:54.591 align:middle line:84%
Like in other words you
can't change the systems

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:55.993 align:middle line:90%
with your conscious mind.

00:54:55.993 --> 00:54:58.629 align:middle line:84%
As consciousness falls
out of the neocortex,

00:54:58.629 --> 00:55:01.965 align:middle line:84%
so you move deeper into the
autonomic nervous system,

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:05.569 align:middle line:84%
you know that fight or flight,
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:08.305 align:middle line:84%
that autonomic, automatic
nervous system that causes you

00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:10.908 align:middle line:84%
to salivate when you
see the chocolate cake.

00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Well if you're changing the
program now, you're changing it

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.879 align:middle line:84%
in the Autonomic nervous system,
you won't salivate any longer

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:17.214 align:middle line:90%
because you changed it there.

00:55:17.214 --> 00:55:19.082 align:middle line:90%
This is bliss in the brain.

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:22.419 align:middle line:84%
You can see right around the
third level, the third row

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:26.690 align:middle line:84%
down there, second one
over from the left,

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.525 align:middle line:84%
you see a brain that's
bright red.

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:32.229 align:middle line:84%
And that is energy making
its way to the brain.

00:55:32.229 --> 00:55:33.730 align:middle line:90%
This is being in the moment.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:37.234 align:middle line:84%
You can see a person very hypo
coherent in the first slide

00:55:37.234 --> 00:55:39.803 align:middle line:84%
and then in the second slide
their brain is way more

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.738 align:middle line:90%
organized and more balanced.

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, this woman had an
amazing, amazing experience.

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:49.446 align:middle line:84%
We were watching her brain
patterns during this event

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:52.749 align:middle line:84%
and she was pretty much started
her event in a certain level,

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:84%
her meditation went -- we were
watching it during the event,

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.057 align:middle line:84%
during the meditation and
I want you to see what full

00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:02.125 align:middle line:84%
out ecstasy looks
like in the brain.

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:02.926 align:middle line:90%
See how red that is?

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:03.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:03.894 --> 00:56:04.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
That is energy.

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:05.329 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:06.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
That's Kundalini.

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.298 align:middle line:84%
This woman was sobbing
she was in so much joy

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:09.566 align:middle line:90%
and she wasn't doing it.

00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:11.001 align:middle line:90%
It was happening to her.

00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:13.370 align:middle line:84%
It was energy, all
of that energy is

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:16.273 align:middle line:84%
as the body is the mind is
moving back to the brain.

00:56:16.273 --> 00:56:18.775 align:middle line:84%
This person was in the
state of absolute bliss.

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:20.410 align:middle line:90%
State of absolute ecstasy.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.379 align:middle line:84%
This is a person with a
traumatic brain injury.

00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:24.681 align:middle line:84%
All that blue means
is it's hypo coherent.

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:25.882 align:middle line:90%
He's struggling.

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:28.085 align:middle line:84%
The light bulbs as ten
watts instead of 15-watts.

00:56:28.085 --> 00:56:29.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:29.086 --> 00:56:29.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
After four days

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.021 align:middle line:90%
of meditation, normal brain.

00:56:31.021 --> 00:56:32.389 align:middle line:90%
Normal brain.

00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:35.125 align:middle line:84%
He's wheelchair bound at the
end of this event, he stood up.

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:38.629 align:middle line:84%
Traumatic brain injury same
guy, look at how blue it is

00:56:38.629 --> 00:56:41.231 align:middle line:90%
in all those different segments.

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:42.766 align:middle line:90%
In other words he's not --

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.935 align:middle line:84%
his brain is not
getting enough energy.

00:56:44.935 --> 00:56:47.437 align:middle line:84%
This is a normal
brain after four days.

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm seeing here
then if we were talking

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.276 align:middle line:90%
about earlier what is faith?

00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:54.478 align:middle line:84%
And accessing that
faith in self.

00:56:54.478 --> 00:56:57.281 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught to not
have faith in ourselves

00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:58.815 align:middle line:90%
and in our own potentials,

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:03.287 align:middle line:84%
but what you're showing us is
actually I think a good hook

00:57:03.287 --> 00:57:05.322 align:middle line:84%
for developing faith
in what we're capable

00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:07.724 align:middle line:84%
of because the science is
now supporting the faith.

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:08.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Sure.

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:08.892 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:09.926 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:10.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
And look at this.

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:12.229 align:middle line:84%
Look at this person with
Parkinson's disease.

00:57:12.229 --> 00:57:14.598 align:middle line:84%
This is a person when you
have Parkinson's disease,

00:57:14.598 --> 00:57:16.700 align:middle line:84%
the brain is working
way too hard.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:17.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:18.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
It's hyper coherent.

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:19.670 align:middle line:90%
A person has very, very --

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:21.938 align:middle line:84%
are lot of difficulty
thinking clearly.

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:23.874 align:middle line:90%
The brain is way out of balance.

00:57:23.874 --> 00:57:27.911 align:middle line:84%
After four days of meditation,
this is a normal brain.

00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:29.746 align:middle line:90%
Her tremors went away.

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:32.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Now interestingly, you showed
us the woman who's brain was

00:57:32.883 --> 00:57:34.518 align:middle line:90%
blissed out, bright red.

00:57:34.518 --> 00:57:36.920 align:middle line:84%
You show us the really
stressed out brain, bright red.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.721 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference in --

00:57:37.721 --> 00:57:38.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Okay.

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:39.923 align:middle line:84%
Different -- without going
into too much detail.

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:41.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it's a lot of energy.

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: No, no.

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:45.762 align:middle line:84%
In this particular mechanism,
this particular graph,

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:48.398 align:middle line:84%
the red in this situation
is measuring what's

00:57:48.398 --> 00:57:49.433 align:middle line:90%
called coherence.

00:57:49.433 --> 00:57:50.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:57:50.534 --> 00:57:51.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza:
So the redder it is

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:53.870 align:middle line:84%
in this slide means the
more hyper coherent.

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.605 align:middle line:90%
The more static is going on.

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:56.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Active.

00:57:56.073 --> 00:57:57.207 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:58.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: So
the other brain scan,

00:57:58.275 --> 00:58:00.110 align:middle line:84%
the other quantitative
measurement

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:03.313 align:middle line:84%
that we use is standard
deviations of temperature.

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:05.449 align:middle line:90%
So here's the other measurement.

00:58:05.449 --> 00:58:07.751 align:middle line:84%
So look how blue
the brain is here.

00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:10.053 align:middle line:84%
Which means there's not
a lot of activity going.

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:11.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:11.388 --> 00:58:12.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: That is
a normal brain right there.

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:12.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:13.824 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Well --

00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:15.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: No tremors.

00:58:15.025 --> 00:58:17.861 align:middle line:84%
This person without any
drugs without any surgery

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:19.696 align:middle line:90%
without anything in her belief

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:21.431 align:middle line:84%
in herself changed
her state of being.

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:23.233 align:middle line:84%
>> We only have about
two minutes left.

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.936 align:middle line:84%
So for you and I think
it might be redundant

00:58:25.936 --> 00:58:29.673 align:middle line:84%
to even ask this question, but
what is the most hopeful element

00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:32.509 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual technology
right now when we look

00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:35.779 align:middle line:84%
at the incredible trouble
people are in in mass

00:58:35.779 --> 00:58:37.514 align:middle line:90%
on a chronic disease level?

00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:38.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Yeah.

00:58:38.582 --> 00:58:39.683 align:middle line:84%
Someone's got to start
telling the truth,

00:58:39.683 --> 00:58:42.386 align:middle line:84%
that the number one
reason for people living

00:58:42.386 --> 00:58:46.289 align:middle line:84%
in physical imbalance is because
of the hormones of stress,

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:48.692 align:middle line:84%
75 to 90% of every
person that walks

00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:51.261 align:middle line:84%
into a health care facility
is walking in because

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:53.930 align:middle line:84%
of the stress related
disorder and the longer we live

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:56.299 align:middle line:84%
by stress the more
disease we'll become.

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:58.435 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care what
drug, what surgery you do,

00:58:58.435 --> 00:59:01.738 align:middle line:84%
until you take care of the cause
of that problem, then you know,

00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:04.708 align:middle line:84%
when Jesus healed his people
he said, "Sin no more."

00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:06.109 align:middle line:84%
What he meant was
change your attitude,

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:07.477 align:middle line:90%
I've got a busy day today.

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:09.279 align:middle line:84%
I've got a crucifixion
coming up,

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.314 align:middle line:84%
I've got a mother who's
worried about me, I have 12 guys

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:13.316 align:middle line:84%
who have no idea what
I'm talking about.

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:14.851 align:middle line:84%
If you don't change your
attitude I'm going to have

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:16.153 align:middle line:90%
to come back and do this again.

00:59:16.153 --> 00:59:18.922 align:middle line:84%
So I think people have to
realize that we're a cause

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:21.892 align:middle line:84%
of all of this and start
taking our power back instead

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:24.594 align:middle line:84%
of believing that everybody
has the answers, start finding

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:26.329 align:middle line:84%
out for yourself
the truth behind it

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:27.697 align:middle line:84%
and start making your
own personal changes.

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So it really has to
be a committed practice.

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.236 align:middle line:84%
Take however much time
we can each day to go

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.671 align:middle line:90%
and create this new reality.

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:35.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Just even
if you just spent a little bit

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:37.707 align:middle line:84%
of time doing that you
would see the effects.

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:39.276 align:middle line:90%
Be the scientist In your life --

00:59:39.276 --> 00:59:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:40.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: --

00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:41.878 align:middle line:90%
and never wait for science

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:42.412 align:middle line:84%
to give you permission
to do the uncommon.

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:43.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:45.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza: Do the
uncommon and do it consistently

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:46.616 align:middle line:84%
and then have science come
and measure you and say wow,

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.752 align:middle line:90%
we need to change our laws.

00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:53.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. As always, not just a
pleasure but very elucidating

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:56.593 align:middle line:84%
for all of us and we're going
to have another conversation.

00:59:56.593 --> 00:59:59.729 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to continue our
conversation by going deeper

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:02.899 align:middle line:84%
into the esoteric and speaking
about our non-linear selves

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:05.936 align:middle line:84%
which we have talked about just
a bit and the pineal gland.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:07.537 align:middle line:84%
You want want to miss
this conversation.

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:08.572 align:middle line:84%
