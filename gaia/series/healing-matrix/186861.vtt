00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE MORTER: According
to quantum physics,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.800 align:middle line:84%
we know that multiple
possibilities

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:90%
can exist simultaneously.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:10%
What could that mean
for us in the present

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:10%
when faced with illness
that could either

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:10%
result in tragedy or recovery?

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
our consciousness

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:84%
can time travel into
the future and see

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and to experience the
best possible outcome?

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Joining us today is
Dr. Julia Mossbridge.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
She's a visiting scholar
at Northwestern University,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and she's here to discuss
how practical time travel may

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:90%
be the key to radical healing.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Mossbridge.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Tell us, how did
you first become

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
interested in of all
things time travel?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIA MOSSBRIDGE: Well,
it's a very personal story.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I would lie in bed
for hours after I

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:90%
had been put to bed as a child.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The reason I was
thinking about it

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:84%
was because of a forgotten
period of abuse right

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:90%
before I went to bed.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And I would lie in bed and
there was this woman who would

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:10%
in my mind's eye I
would imagine was

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:10%
sending me loving energy from
a chair right next to the bed.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:10%
And when I grew up,
and was in my 40s,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:10%
and started playing around
with mental time travel,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:10%
I realized that woman
was me in my 40s,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:10%
because I would habitually go
back and send that young girl

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:10%
who was being abused--

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:10%
I would send her love.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.180 align:middle line:10%
And so that's
really why I started

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:10%
getting interested in it
because that experience of being

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.495 align:middle line:10%
loved as a child when difficult
things were going on saved me.

00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: There's so much
to dig into with this.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I know our viewers are
fascinated about the ideas.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us what happened
that allowed you to realize

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that that was you from a future
state here now speaking to you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:90%
as a child?

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: I guess the story
is, I have a scientific mind.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.423 align:middle line:84%
And so when I would have
precognitive dreams as a child,

00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I would think, well,
maybe I misremembered it.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'd write it
down in a journal.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And I would check, no, I
really did dream about that.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Or no, I didn't.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.287 align:middle line:90%
I did make it up--

00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and just started looking
at that and getting

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.078 align:middle line:84%
more and more interested
in how the mind works,

00:02:45.078 --> 00:02:46.317 align:middle line:90%
how the brain works.

00:02:46.317 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went to
college and later graduate

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.042 align:middle line:84%
school in neuroscience and
then later in psycho-acoustics,

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
the psychology of
sound perception,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I got really interested
in time and timing,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
because I think of this
root experience of time

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
being out of order.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And then in my 40s,
when I was doing work,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
as one does in one's 40s,
one tends to go back and say,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:90%
what happened in my childhood?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
What are those problems that
I'm sort of unconscious of?

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I was noticing
that in therapy,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I always talked about
this sort of presence.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And I described her
once to a therapist,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that I
was describing myself

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
in my present moment
and the exercise

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:90%
of going back and sending love.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was a journey
both intellectual,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:84%
because that's my nature,
but also emotional,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:90%
because that's also my nature.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.515 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can we go back
just for a moment

00:03:37.515 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
to your childhood,
the 40-year-old self,

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:90%
the unconditional love?

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you just speak about, again,
how did she know what she knew

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of tap into
that again for everyone?

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:90%
So let's see, which she?

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:90%
The childhood self or both?

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Kind of both, OK.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: All of the above.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: The
childhood self perhaps

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
knew what she knew and could
survive that difficult period

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
because of getting information
from her future self, who

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
was sitting in
that rocking chair

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%
every night giving her love.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And the future self knew to
go back and have the conscious

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.992 align:middle line:84%
meditation of sitting
in that rocking chair,

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
giving the seven-,
and eight-, and nine-,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and 10-year-old love
because it happened.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's this loop.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to
really prove causality

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:90%
in any particular direction.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So this loop idea is
pretty consistent with what

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:90%
we know about reality.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So as this
presence was there

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
for the younger
version of the self,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
the presence of unconditional
love is really there.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like when we go back
into our own childhood

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.315 align:middle line:84%
from this moment now
and say, bless you.

00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
You were doing the
best that you could.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.175 align:middle line:90%
This was exactly perfect.

00:04:58.175 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
else you needed

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.180 align:middle line:84%
to be doing any differently--
and know and accept that.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And as we tell that childhood
version of ourselves that,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
it allows the energy, the
whole recipe, to shift.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And then this
experience rolls out,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and we are now a healed version
of that child that perhaps

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
wasn't ever able to heal
until we went back and gave it

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
permission to accept
themselves just as they were.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Now us in the present
moment is walking along

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:84%
with a healed version of our
inner child, so to speak,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps was never allowed
to be healed until we gave it

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:90%
permission.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Is this in accordance--

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Or did heal
because we gave it permission.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of this
difference between changing

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and influencing.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So I healed because of my
future self being there.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there wasn't ever a
time when I wasn't healed.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So we know that reality
is a quantum world.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a quantum realm.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And we've been trying to study
it in a linear fashion, which

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
is why it makes sense
in the biggest picture

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
that we could have
access to something

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
in the future,
something in the past.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.743 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do today is
just break this down and make it

00:06:11.743 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:84%
super user-friendly
for people because I

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
know that our viewers have
been in similar situations.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I know that lots of times
people have had experiences

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that they had a precognition, or
this hunch, or this intuition.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we'd love to do is
break it down and make it not

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
be science fiction but to allow
it to be supported by science,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
because we live in a culture
that wants the science.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.705 align:middle line:84%
So how can we make the
distinction between science

00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:90%
and science fiction?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.775 align:middle line:84%
And how can people
start to feel solid

00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
in some of these experiences
that are happening for them?

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: One
thing that I'm very

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
passionate about is
helping people get it

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:90%
that their experiences are real.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need anyone to
prove to me that that was me

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
in the chair
because there wasn't

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
a person in that chair
in the physical world.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
It was an experience
I was having.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.257 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I
had that experience.

00:06:59.257 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And later I know I
have the experience

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:84%
that that's me in the
chair, and that's allowed.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So we've gotten into
a worldview that

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.248 align:middle line:84%
says that if it's not
the couch, it's not real.

00:07:10.248 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure about the
reality of our own experience,

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:84%
but we're sure about the couch,
which is exactly the opposite.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:84%
We totally infer that
the couch exists,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
but we do know that
we have experience.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's,
first, really important

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
to get it that your
experiences matter

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.183 align:middle line:84%
and they're real, as
real as the couch,

00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
probably more real
than the couch.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I think that
is so valuable.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Can you say it again?

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Sure.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So the number-one thing
we know-- and this

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
is even true for the most
conservative scientist

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
if they think about
it carefully--

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:84%
the number one
thing that you know

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:90%
is that you have experience.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Actually, let me
back up from that.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Experience is happening.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:84%
You might be unclear
whether there's a you,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.843 align:middle line:90%
but experience is happening.

00:07:53.843 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And people
are noticing it.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:90%
They feel it.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:84%
No one can take
it away from them.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.562 align:middle line:90%
This is my personal experience.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:90%
I know I know I know.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that is
so, so very valid and becoming

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.317 align:middle line:84%
a valid conversation even
in scientific realms.

00:08:08.317 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Right.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:90%
So there's that is really true.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And if we can hold onto
that without saying,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:84%
therefore, the couch
doesn't exist--

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
so it's hard for people
to hold on to both.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it is really
the case that our experience is

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
real, and there's some kind
of third-person agreement

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:90%
that the couch exists.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Agreed-upon reality here.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
We both agree we're
sitting on a couch.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.588 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah,
right, exactly.

00:08:27.588 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you can grasp
the both of those

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and say they're
both true, then I

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
think that you're in
total action for being

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.375 align:middle line:84%
able to do science, because
science is all about trying

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to explain our
experience of what

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
happens with this
third-party agreement

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:90%
of the physical reality.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And to generate
our reality and our life

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
experience, which is ultimately,
on the healing matrix, what

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.670 align:middle line:84%
we want to do is
uncover every single way

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
that we can get
to radical healing

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that people can recognize
that they have the capacity

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
to do this in ways
that perhaps we haven't

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:90%
been taught in the past.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for
us to know this.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you've done research

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
in physics, and psychology,
and biology, physiology,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
leading down this
path to scientificate

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
this possibility that we
initially were speaking

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:90%
about-- time travel.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So can we speak a little
bit about time travel

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
in terms of these
things that you've

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:84%
studied to make it super
clear for our viewers?

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah, so
time travel is, in my view,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
anything that's
mental or physical

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:84%
or both that is going
in a direction that's

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
opposing this sort of
linear what we call

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.680 align:middle line:90%
the forward movement of time.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you're able to go
back mentally or physically

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.850 align:middle line:84%
or both or forward mentally
or physically or both

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.433 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to obtain
evidence that you have done so,

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
experiential evidence

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.658 align:middle line:84%
or physical evidence or both,
that would be time travel.

00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: For example,
how would someone

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:84%
know that they
had time traveled?

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: So mental time
travel is equivalent in my view

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:90%
to both memory--

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:84%
literally everyone
has memory every day.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.297 align:middle line:84%
That's mental time
travel to the past--

00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and precognition,
which is mental time

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:90%
travel to the future.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, precognition sounds so
much freakier than memory

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
because we're not used
to it, and yet it's

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:90%
practically universal.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I say it's
practically universal

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.180 align:middle line:84%
is because of a
statistical analysis

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I did and a series of
physiological studies

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:24.580 align:middle line:84%
showing that people's
physiology-- so their heartbeat

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:90%
changes and sweats, respiration.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:90%
You can even look at EEG.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I've looked at EEG
before-- brainwaves.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
There's folks who have looked at
fMRIs, so neuro-imaging stuff.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.212 align:middle line:84%
All of these measures have
shown that when you randomize--

00:10:41.212 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:84%
put someone in front
of a computer screen

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.473 align:middle line:84%
and you randomize
a series of images,

00:10:44.473 --> 00:10:46.640 align:middle line:84%
some of which are really
emotional and some of which

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
are neutral, that before
the emotional images,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
physiology is
behaving differently

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:90%
than before the neutral images.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's fairly robust.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.702 align:middle line:84%
There are several folks who
have disagreed with that result

00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and have talked about
why, and then we've

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
come out in the
literature and talked

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.478 align:middle line:84%
about why their disagreements
don't make sense.

00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So there's a robust academic
conversation about it.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But to my knowledge, it
hasn't been knocked down

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:90%
in terms of methodology.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm more and more
convinced the more

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I see it in myself and
others that it's real.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And the question then
becomes, what's going on,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:90%
and what can we do with it?

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.818 align:middle line:84%
And I have been
studying what's going on

00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
in the world of physics,
but I'm fascinated with,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:90%
what can we do with it?

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, that's
right where I work too,

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:90%
so I'm thrilled about this.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So in all the experiments
that you've been doing,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:90%
let's get to that.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And what are the outcomes?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you're
finding in bottom line?

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Bottom
line, time doesn't

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:90%
work the way we think it does.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So our experience of time in
the everyday waking daily state

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
tends to be this
linear-- this thing

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:84%
that we've been taught about
the linear movement forward.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:90%
But even that isn't true.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Even your waking
daily experience

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
where you think that
everything's moving forward,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.090 align:middle line:90%
you're skipping around.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking about, what
am I going to do tomorrow?

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Or you're having deja vu.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Or you're having precognition.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And it just sort of
blends into the day.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing it all the time,
and that's the bottom line.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet there's
this taboo about it

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.370 align:middle line:84%
because people are told
it's not scientific

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:84%
or they're crazy if
they think they're

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:84%
having these dreams, or
visions, or intuitions.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And so it's under acknowledged.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what are
the data points

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:90%
that you're working with?

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.133 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
you're looking at?

00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: So it
depends on the experiment.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm working with
humans, it'll be--

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about this
liver healing study.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:90%
This is a good example.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this study, I'm working
with a liver pathologist who

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
has groups of people who
have liver cirrhosis, which

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:90%
is a scarring of the liver.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:03.843 align:middle line:84%
And he already has slides
of their liver tissue.

00:13:03.843 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
They've already been diagnosed
with liver cirrhosis,

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
but the slides have
not been scored

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:84%
according to the
progression of the disease.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're sitting there,
but they're not scored.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.762 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the person's doing
their treatment, et cetera.

00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
The reason they
haven't been scored

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.793 align:middle line:84%
is there's a new
technique for scoring that

00:13:22.793 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been applied to them.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that the
doctors have been

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:90%
neglectful in not scoring them.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.162 align:middle line:84%
It's that they haven't
applied this new technique

00:13:31.162 --> 00:13:32.648 align:middle line:90%
because kind of no one has.

00:13:32.648 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of the
perfect situation

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:90%
for this kind of time travel.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So what we're wanting to
do in that experiment--

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:90%
we're setting up to do this--

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
is to have groups
of individuals.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.187 align:middle line:84%
One group does a
meditation that literally

00:13:46.187 --> 00:13:48.770 align:middle line:84%
asks them to imagine going back
in time before their liver was

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
hurt and talking to their
liver before the cells start

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:90%
to get scarred.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.163 align:middle line:84%
And the other is just a
relaxation meditation,

00:13:56.163 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and we want them to do this
for 30 days, those two groups.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:90%
They all have liver cirrhosis.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.507 align:middle line:84%
So one question is, how does it
affect their future prognosis?

00:14:03.507 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
How do they feel
after the meditation?

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Which is sort of a
mainstream question.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Do these two
different meditations

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:84%
actually change the future
of these people's disease?

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.668 align:middle line:84%
But another question
is, how do the slides

00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
look when they're done with
that month, the slides that

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:84%
were already taken from them
but haven't been scored?

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's the retro causal,
the backwards time travel piece

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:90%
that is super interesting.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the
slides are changing?

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.813 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: So let's
talk about the word change.

00:14:30.813 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
idea in the field

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
that the past can't change
but it could be influenced.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.037 align:middle line:84%
So change suggests I'm
holding up five fingers.

00:14:43.037 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And then a week from now, I do
some kind of time travel thing,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.495 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm really
holding up three fingers.

00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a change.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But influence would be
I held up three fingers

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
because I was being
influenced from the future.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to know it.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, fabulous.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: And so
it's not that they've

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.975 align:middle line:84%
changed it that
they've been influenced

00:15:01.975 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:90%
by these future meditations.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they
hadn't been scored yet

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:90%
allows that influence to happen.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.560 align:middle line:90%
If you develop a technology--

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling it temporceuticals--
time-ceuticals--

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
a technology where in
the future you reach back

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and you influence the thing
that hasn't been measured,

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.548 align:middle line:90%
potentially that could work.

00:15:26.548 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say,
this is a radical idea.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
No one should jump up and
down and say, well, we

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:90%
should all do this.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be proven.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And there is one study,
only one study out there,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that specifically tries
to do this with prayer.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And they did find
in effect a prayer

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that actually
retro-casually seems

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:84%
to have influenced
health outcomes

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.587 align:middle line:90%
in the past in a positive way.

00:15:48.587 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So these are people who
already left the hospital,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.378 align:middle line:84%
but it's influencing
their hospital stays

00:15:52.378 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
in ways that hadn't
been measured before.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So then does it serve
us to go into our future selves

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and look back upon us today
and constantly be creating,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:84%
generating the ideal
self, the healed one?

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It serves us in both directions.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
What I train people to
do with this stuff--

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:84%
now the way I train
precognition--

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:84%
the conscious precognition
or controlled precognition

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.490 align:middle line:84%
is something I love to train
people because it shifts you

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:84%
as a person, because here, I
am holding my hands like this

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:90%
for a reason.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Here's your future self.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Here's your past self.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
In order to do
good precognition,

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
you want to talk
to your future self

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey, what's going on?

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.796 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just tell me
what the information is.

00:16:33.796 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fill me in ahead of time.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.435 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Just fill me in.

00:16:37.435 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And the future self has to
have a good relationship

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:90%
with the past self to do that.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.793 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And what would it say?

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: It would
say you're doing great.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And here's some information.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:84%
But the information it
gives might not be like--

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
this one might be like, well,
thanks for not telling me

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:84%
exactly what-- and
there's like, but you

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:90%
didn't need to know that.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you the
information you need to know.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So you'd start to develop
this powerful connection.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.902 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it's beads on
a string of all yourselves.

00:17:04.902 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:84%
This relates to a
dream I once had

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:84%
where all my selves
from two to 80 years old

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.447 align:middle line:84%
came together inside
of me through my heart.

00:17:12.447 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I understand.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like,
all right, that's it.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:90%
It's all in there.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.167 align:middle line:84%
It's all encapsulated,
and it unfolds over time.

00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's all part of who we are.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:90%
It's very strengthening.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you're living in
accordance with that there's

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
a guidance that's
happening in my life,

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's my future
self or my higher self.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Someone might-- in a
spiritual conversation,

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
they might describe it as
this higher overseeing,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
this overarching
presence that is going

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:90%
to guide this life experience.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And maybe our
free-will choice is

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to choose our
experience about what's

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.920 align:middle line:84%
going on but that
what's going on

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.962 align:middle line:84%
is always going to be in
the highest good for us.

00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:46.503 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Right,
and I'm not even

00:17:46.503 --> 00:17:47.877 align:middle line:90%
sure we choose our experience.

00:17:47.877 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it's pretty
relaxing to assume

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
we don't have any
free will, but I know

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of in the minority.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: People definitely want
to have some free-will choice.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice a difference
between men and women, older,

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:90%
younger?

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.498 align:middle line:84%
Is this accessible
equally to all?

00:18:03.498 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah, I
notice a gender difference.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.258 align:middle line:84%
I'm super fascinated by the
gender difference stuff.

00:18:08.258 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So there's the conscious
gender difference,

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
unconscious gender difference.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So the gender difference
that I'm talking about

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:84%
is largely between younger
men and younger women.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
After around 45, which
is the average onset

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
of the menopause
symptoms, men and women

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
become more similar,
which is why

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a hormonal
component with all this.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:84%
But younger men and women tend
to go in opposite directions

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
on almost every precognition
task or time travel

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:90%
task I give them.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.202 align:middle line:90%
And those are often unconscious.

00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
sometimes they don't even

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:90%
know it's a precognition task.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm scoring it according
to the future event,

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know that.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Conscious precognition is
also super interesting.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's something called
controlled precognition.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
What I realized is that men
really need to have this,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:90%
no, you were wrong on that.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you were right on that.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.393 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying all men
but just on average--

00:19:02.393 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more structure
around, no, you're

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:90%
right and wrong.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
On average, women, it's
just constant encouragement.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it might be
softening the black and white

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and allowing people to be
more open to this possibility

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.457 align:middle line:84%
of being a little more free
than we thought we were.

00:19:19.457 --> 00:19:21.332 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Well,
there's this relationship

00:19:21.332 --> 00:19:23.630 align:middle line:84%
between the analytical mind
and the intuitive mind.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And the intuitive
mind is the one

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:84%
that has this capacity to get
information from the future

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and potentially to
influence the past.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the analytical
mind, however,

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is great at keeping the
intuitive mind on task.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:90%
So you need both.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And so just having a
relationship between them where

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
they each do the jobs
that they're good at

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.360 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to do
the job of the other one

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:90%
feels powerful to me.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the idea that
consciousness is really

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
non-local, that we
are awareness itself.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we would have access
to the future and to the past,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and we have this kind of access.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just
curious about how

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
you're tying the past
self and the future self

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
together by allowing them to
communicate with each other,

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
allowing them all to be
part of a state of being.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And so is that relationship
directly related to time

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
travel as you're studying it
with your experimentation?

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Cool.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I think not only
is it related, it's

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
related in two ways that
are really important.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:84%
It's related in one way on
the application side, which

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
is if you're going to--
let's say we invent

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
actual physical time travel
that also includes mental time

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So the whole shebang, like
the science-fiction version

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
where you take yourself,
your body and your memories

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and your personality,
somewhere else in time.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's say we invent that.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:90%
So assume it's not impossible.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:54.850 align:middle line:84%
In a world in which we
live today, in this world,

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:84%
doing that is going to
cause all sorts of problems

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:84%
because it's an egoic world
that's driven by a lot of fear,

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and scarcity, et cetera.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see the
problems that would emerge.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And so if you also have people
understanding more and more

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:84%
around the world that there's
this unconditional love

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and connection with
one's self over time

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that is the most powerful
thing, more powerful than hate

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:90%
or anything else--

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.712 align:middle line:84%
if you have both of
those understandings,

00:21:27.712 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:84%
then this time-travel
piece will be

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
used for something that will
be beneficial to humanity,

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:84%
not just the person
who's using it.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And so that's an
application side.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
a technical side,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:84%
which is in terms of discovering
physical time travel along

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
with mental time travel and
really operationalizing that

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.630 align:middle line:90%
in a process that really works.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I think you're actually going
to need some insights from

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
side that says, yes,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is actually
this non-local primary thing--

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:90%
force, field, whatever it is--

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
mathematically,

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.793 align:middle line:84%
scientifically,
technically true about

00:22:05.793 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
how that works
that we don't quite

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.933 align:middle line:84%
know yet that that's going to
give us information about how

00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:90%
to do the time travel.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think in both the
application and the technology,

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I think you need
that connection.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And how fascinating
that unconditional love

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:90%
is the melding ingredient.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is
required for the most

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
effective and efficient
use of time travel.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because it
is also the most important

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
ingredient when someone
is truly attempting

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.993 align:middle line:84%
to access higher levels of their
own consciousness, this quality

00:22:38.993 --> 00:22:39.910 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibrational frequency
that is bridging the worlds, so

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:90%
to speak.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.518 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: It's
something you tap into, yes.

00:22:46.518 --> 00:22:49.127 align:middle line:84%
So my scientist's mind,
whenever someone says frequency,

00:22:49.127 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:84%
always says, well,
it could be phased,

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.418 align:middle line:84%
or it could be the
bandwidth, or it could

00:22:52.418 --> 00:22:54.610 align:middle line:90%
be not a wave or something.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But what we know is, it's
something we tap into.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a field.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's some kind of
energetic frequency, whatever.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not coming from us.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:90%
It's something we can--

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:84%
well, not only us-- it's
something we can tap into.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And tapping into or
accessing unconditional love

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:90%
is necessary for everything.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.032 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, time travel for
sure, it seems to me.

00:23:16.032 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But there's also this similarity
between unconditional love

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:84%
where it's a bridging
in space between people,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a
bridging in time.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:84%
If you unconditionally
love yourself and others,

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to just be
limited to this one moment

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.732 align:middle line:84%
It would be at all
times and all places.

00:23:32.732 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're always
available and open to what

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:35.627 align:middle line:90%
an outcome could be.

00:23:35.627 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Right.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And so unconditional love
is almost another name

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:90%
for time travel.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, interesting--
very interesting.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So can we really apply these
concepts of time travel

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to heal ourselves in
real-life situations?

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Barb Scholz was an engineer
living a normal life

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.580 align:middle line:84%
until out of the blue
she lost her eyesight.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
She was faced with the
dreadful possibility

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.558 align:middle line:90%
that she would never see again.

00:23:59.558 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at her story.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARB SCHOLZ: Hello,
my name is Barb Scholz.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:10%
And I am here to
tell you about how

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:13.970 align:middle line:10%
I used time shifting to heal
a condition of blindness that

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:10%
came to me when I
was in my mid 40s.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed
with optic neuritis.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I one day could not see
out of my right eye,

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
and I went straight to the ER.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I was
told by the ER doc

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
is that this is the leading
indicator for MS or potentially

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:90%
a brain tumor.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:84%
The doctor ordered a test to
find out what was going on--

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.370 align:middle line:84%
MRIs, blood work, all
the standard stuff.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:10%
But they wanted to put me on
a very intense drug protocol

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:10%
to see if they could bring
down the inflammation.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:10%
I knew those drugs
had side effects.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:10%
And I bargained with the
doctor to give me some time

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:10%
to see if some of the
things that I knew how to do

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:10%
could bring down
the inflammation.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:10%
And I asked, how much
time could I have?

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:10%
He said, you could
have two weeks.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:10%
And I said, all right.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:10%
So I went home, and I realized
all the alternative methods

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:10%
that I have learned
were sight based.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:10%
I could not do any of
them, and I was horrified.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:10%
I was in deep fear.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:10%
And then I remembered something
a meditation teacher said to me

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:10%
that made no sense to
me but suddenly might

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:10%
have application.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:10%
He said, the future creates the
present against the backdrop

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:10%
of the past--

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.260 align:middle line:10%
always felt very weird.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:10%
But I started to
realize that maybe I

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:10%
could turn to a
future where none

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:10%
of the things that the doctors
were talking about were there,

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.740 align:middle line:10%
a future where I could see,
a future where I felt great,

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.040 align:middle line:10%
a future where I was happy.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:10%
And so I started going into
meditation many, many times

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.540 align:middle line:10%
a day.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:10%
Basically every time I felt
fear, I would go lie down,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:10%
and I would meditate.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:10%
So what happened is I
connected with this future

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.310 align:middle line:10%
where I knew I could
see, and I knew I was OK.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:10%
And that future started to
give me a sense of how it felt.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:10%
It would abate the fears.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:10%
It would help ease the
horror of what was going on.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, during the time of
not being able to see,

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:10%
it was fairly complete.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:10%
I had a little bit
of peripheral vision,

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:10%
but I couldn't see my hands.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't see if I tried
to cross the street.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.100 align:middle line:10%
One time I saw a truck
out of one side of my eye.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:10%
And foof, it disappeared, and
it came out the other side.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:10%
So it was like I was
very dysfunctional.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And in this whole
process, the future

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:84%
kept giving me this
sense of stability,

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:84%
this sense of something else was
out there for me besides this.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.940 align:middle line:10%
And at two weeks I
returned to the doctor.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:10%
And even though the second eye
that was starting to go blind

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:10%
was getting worse, the other
eye was getting slightly better.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:10%
And so I asked for
another two weeks.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:10%
And we had another two weeks of
working with this meditation.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:10%
And I kept working
with a future self.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:10%
And the future started
feeding me, and nourishing me,

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:10%
and giving me insights,
and helping me.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:10%
And when I went
back in two weeks,

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.130 align:middle line:10%
the first eye that
had gone blind

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:10%
was starting to see better,
and I could make out

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.160 align:middle line:10%
things on the eye test.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.680 align:middle line:10%
And he said, OK, you can
have another two weeks.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:10%
So when I went back
after another two

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.850 align:middle line:10%
weeks of working with my
future self as my only tool,

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:10%
I realized that both my eyes
were seeing well enough that I

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.030 align:middle line:10%
could get by.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.990 align:middle line:10%
And at the end of seven
weeks, I returned to work.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But I kept working
with my future self,

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and what happened is that,
knowing the emotional feelings,

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I did not have to go
into meditation anymore.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
If those feelings came over
me in my day-to-day life,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I would start to know, OK, I'm
about to make a choice that

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:90%
takes me closer to this future.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.720 align:middle line:90%
I need to pay attention.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
It was really a
mind-opening thing

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to realize if I connected with
that future, where I was well,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:84%
where I could see,
I was able to get

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:31.190 align:middle line:84%
her perspective of what
to do instead of trying

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:90%
to guess how to get there.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to make
myself feel happy.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I could go and be with
her, and feel the release,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and feel her joy,
and feel her peace.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when we're caught
in a very hard place, if we

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.360 align:middle line:84%
go to a future where we
flourish, to a future

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:84%
where we actually
fulfill our destiny,

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:84%
where we live our
life purpose, and just

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:84%
feel the feelings
that that future has,

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:08.640 align:middle line:84%
we have the capacity to
shift how the here and now is

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:84%
because we're connected
with something

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:90%
greater than this moment.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So manifesting a
different outcome

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.610 align:middle line:84%
is very hard to pull
out of your bootstraps,

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but it's much
easier to reach out

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to a future that
has gone through it

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.060 align:middle line:90%
and listen to her counsel.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
think is important to realize

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.430 align:middle line:84%
is there is nothing
special about me.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I had a different approach.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But anybody can
work with the future

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.850 align:middle line:84%
to inform the present on
how to navigate forward.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Instead of trying to always
dream it up from here

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and feel uncertain, the
future is a powerful ally,

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and we all have multiple,
multiple futures

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.840 align:middle line:90%
we can imagine.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:84%
If we connect to that
future, it starts

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:03.670 align:middle line:84%
to feed to us the information
of what that experience is like.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
we can create how

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
to navigate today
knowing that we're

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.590 align:middle line:90%
headed toward that future.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to make sure that
you know you can do this too.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.065 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:30:20.065 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a very emotional--

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:84%
it's very moving just to hear
her walk someone through this.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.570 align:middle line:84%
How is someone going
to know that they're

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
doing what she's describing
if they were to try

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.050 align:middle line:90%
to do this for themselves?

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to know
this isn't just my imagination,

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:84%
as people are going
to dupe themselves

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:84%
by thinking something like
that, that this future self is

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:90%
a real possibility for me too?

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.245 align:middle line:90%
What do you recommend?

00:30:48.245 --> 00:30:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: I
recommend looking

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.480 align:middle line:90%
at whether it's working.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:90%
So she had a perfect situation.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So Barb asked her doctor,
give me two weeks.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And she had a way to measure
whether it was working.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, OK,
you get another two weeks

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and you get another two weeks
based on that it was working.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So you just look at the outcome
you kind of be a scientist.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:84%
You say, I think I'm connecting
with this future self.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.610 align:middle line:90%
Of course I can't know.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm fooling myself.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's just do it.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to see
what the outcome is.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: For me when
I'm in that state,

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.140 align:middle line:90%
it feels less pressure-some.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It feels like there's
something opening, or something

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.138 align:middle line:90%
warm, or something greater.

00:31:30.138 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And Barb said this,
something greater

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:84%
than myself in this moment,
in this single moment,

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's this more expanded
version of possibility.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And so inside my body
it feels that way.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that
in your experiments

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that people are reporting
these things in mass

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:48.075 align:middle line:84%
that it has that kind
of description for them?

00:31:48.075 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: I want to
be careful about that

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.120 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just starting
those kind of experiments.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't feel
like I can say that,

00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:01.150 align:middle line:84%
but I can't say anecdotally one
of the outcomes is right away.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the outcomes is
in the present moment.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:90%
So how does it feel right now?

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
You know that that's
saying, from the fruit you

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:90%
can know the tree?

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So the fruit-- if you
sit down to meditate,

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.210 align:middle line:84%
or you sit down to have
one of these visualizations

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and develop a relationship
with your future self

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't feel good,
you're doing something wrong.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: It really feels
good when you're connecting--

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.290 align:middle line:84%
the one way in which
it can not feel good

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:84%
is if you're connecting
with a fantasy future self.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've won the lottery,
and I found my true love,

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:90%
and it's a week from now.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:90%
And you know, this sort of--

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't feel good when you
connect with that, because it

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:84%
feels so like everything has to
be different for me to be OK,

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:84%
rather than I'm loving who I
am now and as who I am now,

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.620 align:middle line:84%
feeling like I am
OK as I am now.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm connecting with
this future self

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that also is a wiser,
older version of myself.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a different feeling.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, so how
does Barb's story

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:07.020 align:middle line:84%
draw a relationship
between determining

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.830 align:middle line:84%
how consciousness is determining
our physical reality?

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.480 align:middle line:90%
What is causal there?

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:90%
How does her story reflect that?

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah, so
to me, her story says,

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.980 align:middle line:84%
when someone has the desire to
connect with their future self,

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and get that
information, and pull--

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:84%
she talks about being
fed by her future self.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a perfect metaphor.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I also talk about
being pulled by the future.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.870 align:middle line:90%
There is a connection.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.917 align:middle line:84%
And it's causal in
both directions.

00:33:35.917 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:90%
You're being pulled.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:39.620 align:middle line:90%
You're being fed.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.033 align:middle line:90%
It gets stronger and stronger.

00:33:41.033 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And so much, as
she mentioned, she

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:84%
didn't have to meditate
anymore, so much less effortful.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:84%
To me, that is exactly
the consciousness

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.220 align:middle line:84%
that we all share and tap into
that's being then translated

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:90%
into physical body.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.412 align:middle line:84%
But I kind of think
we're so biased

00:34:01.412 --> 00:34:03.120 align:middle line:84%
to think the physical
body has to produce

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.223 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness that we--

00:34:05.223 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're not, but
I think many people are.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And that it's hard for
people to really feel sure.

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.922 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to feel
sure of any of this.

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is
plenty of evidence

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.150 align:middle line:84%
that your conscious
state influences

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.639 align:middle line:90%
your physical health.

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:84%
But you don't need to
be sure about that.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:84%
Like, this is a technique
anyone can try from in your bed.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.409 align:middle line:84%
You know, you wake
up in the morning.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:32.867 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
have to be sick.

00:34:32.867 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:84%
You can just want to see
how it feels to do this.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Or you could be sick.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But you wake up in
the morning and you

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.482 align:middle line:84%
imagine your evening self
going to bed sending you love.

00:34:42.482 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So you can introduce yourself
to your future self that way.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.088 align:middle line:84%
Just sending you love,
that's all it's doing.

00:34:47.088 --> 00:34:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it wants
to send a message.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.463 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe it doesn't.

00:34:49.463 --> 00:34:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But you just sit there and
receive the unconditional love

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.100 align:middle line:90%
from your evening self.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The next evening?

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: No, that evening.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's morning.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:90%
You wake up.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're like-- I mean, let's
just start with one day, right?

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So let's say that
we wake up Monday morning.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying to have a
conversation before we even

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:10.440 align:middle line:84%
get out of bed or connection
with our Monday-evening self.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah, start out
that way, a short time delay.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.995 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It doesn't have
to be words exchanged.

00:35:14.995 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:84%
It can just be a
connection, that you exist.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Right,
just feeling loved.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: That I honor you.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.850 align:middle line:90%
I acknowledge that you exist.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah, just
get to know that evening

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:90%
self as if it exists right now.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just your evening self.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And then Monday night,
just take a moment

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.940 align:middle line:84%
to send love and any
sort of information

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.795 align:middle line:84%
you might want to send back
to your Monday morning self.

00:35:35.795 --> 00:35:36.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.220 align:middle line:90%
This is not serious.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.190 align:middle line:90%
This can be fun, right?

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.198 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: You can develop
a playful relationship,

00:35:42.198 --> 00:35:44.917 align:middle line:84%
which is 1,000 times better than
a boring, serious relationship.

00:35:44.917 --> 00:35:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So then the
Monday evening self

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.650 align:middle line:84%
is getting into bed and says,
see, Monday morning self, I

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.325 align:middle line:90%
told you it was going to be OK.

00:35:51.325 --> 00:35:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Or-- right, we knew--

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah, or
wow, that was a hard day,

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.860 align:middle line:84%
but you did a good job
navigating that tough stuff.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.325 align:middle line:90%
Or wow, this was amazing.

00:35:57.325 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can't believe that things
are turning out this way.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, I just want
you to know I love you.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to do fine.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: In your
time-travel therapies,

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.585 align:middle line:84%
are you teaching
people this access?

00:36:08.585 --> 00:36:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what are
these therapies

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.160 align:middle line:90%
that you're describing.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Sort
of inventing them

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.530 align:middle line:84%
as we speak-- so as usual,
for me, I invent stuff

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.563 align:middle line:84%
and then go try
to figure it out.

00:36:18.563 --> 00:36:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, put it to test.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.522 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: It seems
like it should work.

00:36:21.522 --> 00:36:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's figure it out.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So one of the projects
I'm intending to work

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.230 align:middle line:84%
on in the next couple of
years-- and I'm in the running

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
for a grant to cover
it, so we shall see--

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.090 align:middle line:84%
is doing, creating time-travel
therapies that are scalable,

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.070 align:middle line:84%
so essentially,
people personalizing

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.130 align:middle line:90%
their own time-travel narrative.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:43.230 align:middle line:90%
We know in psychology--

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.137 align:middle line:84%
and this will be agreed upon
by even the most mainstream

00:36:47.137 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
psychologists-- we
know that something

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.360 align:middle line:84%
called future
orientation is important.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Future orientation is
the extent to which

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:84%
you have a positive relationship
with your image of yourself

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So even wearing sunscreen
or protecting yourself

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, you're
creating a relationship

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.580 align:middle line:84%
with your future self, because
you're saying, in the future,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:90%
I will live.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.040 align:middle line:90%
And I will matter.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So this future orientation
impacts your education.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.135 align:middle line:90%
And it impacts your career.

00:37:12.135 --> 00:37:14.400 align:middle line:84%
It impacts your health,
your well-being.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.930 align:middle line:90%
So it's a huge--

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.130 align:middle line:90%
has a huge impact on life.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And we have this major
future orientation deficit

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:84%
in this country
between the people

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.840 align:middle line:84%
who have high socioeconomic
status and the people

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.090 align:middle line:90%
of low socioeconomic status.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So the people who have
low socioeconomic status

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.070 align:middle line:84%
or who are living in
incarceration, in poverty,

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:84%
dealing with abuse, or
neglect, or trauma, addiction,

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:84%
even if they have high
status, if they're

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.620 align:middle line:84%
dealing with any
of those things,

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.610 align:middle line:84%
their future orientation is
generally, on average, lower.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And but what we
also know is, if you

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:47.590 align:middle line:84%
improve someone's
future orientation,

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:90%
their life improves.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.980 align:middle line:90%
So it can be changed.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do is
scale time-travel therapies,

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.460 align:middle line:84%
that essentially allow people to
mentally travel into the future

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
at different durations, a
day, then a couple days, then

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:84%
a week, then a couple weeks,
then a month, then a couple

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.490 align:middle line:84%
of months, to slowly extend and
strengthen that relationship

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.610 align:middle line:84%
with the future self among
the people who need it most.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.290 align:middle line:90%
So I'm super excited about that.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Tell us a little bit more
about these temporceuticals.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.175 align:middle line:90%
Just.

00:38:15.175 --> 00:38:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Break it down for us.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah,
temporceuticals-- well,

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting with the staff
of the Institute of Noetic

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Sciences, the
science team there.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:90%
And we were brainstorming.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And I forget who came
up with the idea of,

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:90%
the name temporceuticals.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But it means like
pharmaceuticals,

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.190 align:middle line:84%
except you're not using
drugs to cause change.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.770 align:middle line:90%
You're using time.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And especially for
conditions where

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.120 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a
lot of time upfront,

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.570 align:middle line:84%
like traumatic brain injury,
or stroke, or these things

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that are sudden, it
seems to me that those

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.740 align:middle line:84%
are ripe for creating
temporceuticals.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:84%
If we could get it to work that,
OK, fine, you had a stroke.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.850 align:middle line:90%
You're in the hospital.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Things are happening.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But you have hours after that
to go back in time and influence

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:84%
things, if we could actually
pull that off, those conditions

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:middle line:90%
could be much less devastating.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And the other piece of that that
I think is sort of fascinating

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.587 align:middle line:84%
is that, if you
measure everything,

00:39:09.587 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
someone comes into the hospital,
they've had a traumatic brain

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.150 align:middle line:84%
injury, and you
measure everything

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:18.440 align:middle line:84%
like you're supposed
to, by this logic,

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.210 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be to
change those measurements.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So the question
becomes, is there

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.955 align:middle line:84%
a way to not maybe
measure everything?

00:39:24.955 --> 00:39:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Measure the things
you absolutely

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.522 align:middle line:84%
need to measure, but maybe
leave some wiggle room?

00:39:29.522 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so these are the
kind of things I'm studying.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, could you leave a little
wiggle room in the measurements

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:90%
so that things can change?

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's just--

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Barb Scholz, in that video,
was talking about this,

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.670 align:middle line:90%
about that time of I didn't--

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.085 align:middle line:84%
I wanted them to
not find something,

00:39:46.085 --> 00:39:47.960 align:middle line:84%
because then there is
something to work with.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not knowing.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, I've done
this myself with injuries.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:90%
I broke my arm.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
to go and da-da-da,

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.430 align:middle line:84%
so I started doing similar
therapies internally, and just

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.110 align:middle line:84%
working with knowing
that this was

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.060 align:middle line:84%
happening, that this
healing was happening.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I took an x-ray
weeks later to make sure

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that the bone callus was
there and everything was fine,

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.210 align:middle line:84%
but in that moment,
I just knew--

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and not that we're
making suggestions

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.890 align:middle line:84%
that you don't go and receive
traditional care, et cetera.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Do what you have to do.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But in the same
moment, know that we

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:24.740 align:middle line:84%
are powerful beyond what we
have traditionally been trained.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.393 align:middle line:84%
And science is now
validating for us

00:40:27.393 --> 00:40:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that there are other ways of
approaching these things that

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
allow us to land in a
much more empowered state

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and in a much more continual
self-healing state, et cetera.

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at the next 10 years.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.060 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:84%
In this temporceuticals
world, what are we

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:90%
going to be disseminating?

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.250 align:middle line:90%
What's going to be known?

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.470 align:middle line:84%
What are people going
to have access to?

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Well, I
think the big shift--

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:57.837 align:middle line:84%
let's assume
temporceuticals happen,

00:40:57.837 --> 00:40:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and they work, and
people are starting

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:03.140 align:middle line:84%
to get it about connecting
with themselves in the future.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.405 align:middle line:84%
When I think about that,
it gets me really excited.

00:41:05.405 --> 00:41:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I really think about it

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.220 align:middle line:84%
is, it necessarily brings
in this strengthening

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.320 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So any sort of
cultural tradition

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:18.890 align:middle line:84%
that's around, that the
individual is weak and needs

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:21.800 align:middle line:84%
to go out to the store and buy
lots of things to feel better,

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.127 align:middle line:84%
is going to dissipate,
because if you kind of get it

00:41:26.127 --> 00:41:27.710 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
to have everything

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.260 align:middle line:84%
all right at this particular
moment, at some point

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.677 align:middle line:84%
you might have some things,
at some point you have others,

00:41:32.677 --> 00:41:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's still you, the
desire to go out and buy

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of things
kind of goes away.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's a huge shift I
think people would see.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.788 align:middle line:84%
The other piece is the
increase in the scaling

00:41:42.788 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional
love, the experience

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.060 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love, because
once you start connecting over

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.890 align:middle line:84%
time like this, the
only way to connect

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:84%
with your future self
or your past self

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.610 align:middle line:84%
is through this
unconditional love.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.777 align:middle line:84%
If you are connecting
critically, you won't connect.

00:41:54.777 --> 00:41:57.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to connect
critically, you don't connect.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that scaling of
unconditional love is--

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that will
shift our world.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And I really, I'm creating
a nonprofit actually focused

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.870 align:middle line:84%
on both time travel
and unconditional love

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.950 align:middle line:84%
called TILT, The Institute
for Love and Time.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a new organization
that I'm birthing right now.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
focused on this idea,

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that that's the shift
that we can create.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.385 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we know this
possibility is existing.

00:42:23.385 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
encourage ourselves

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.490 align:middle line:84%
to be good in the void,
good in the not knowing.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.265 align:middle line:84%
And yet we also are in a
culture that says, you're sick.

00:42:32.265 --> 00:42:33.140 align:middle line:90%
You go to the doctor.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.348 align:middle line:90%
They're going to measure you.

00:42:34.348 --> 00:42:37.148 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take
all kinds of measurements

00:42:37.148 --> 00:42:39.440 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of data to give
you some kind of feedback

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.880 align:middle line:90%
as to your current status.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, my
question is, do you

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.640 align:middle line:84%
think that we're actually kind
of interfering when we yank

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.410 align:middle line:84%
somebody out of
that void, and we

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:84%
plop them into all these
measurements and all

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.540 align:middle line:84%
this diagnosis, and taking
this family history,

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and doing all these
things that are getting us

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.188 align:middle line:90%
into that analytical state?

00:42:59.188 --> 00:43:00.230 align:middle line:90%
What's the balance there?

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:04.670 align:middle line:84%
How do we know that we're taking
a responsible balanced approach

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.390 align:middle line:84%
to accessing our
own power to heal,

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and being responsible with our
newly found interest in being

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:19.610 align:middle line:84%
a self-healer, and living
in a safe manner there?

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: You know, I see
that doctors, our MDs and DOs,

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:28.380 align:middle line:90%
they're our partners in healing.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Naturopaths, they're
all partners in healing.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
going to see a doctor

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:84%
you trust and they do these
measurements, let them do them,

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.360 align:middle line:84%
because what we can
have faith in is

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that medical science hasn't
thought of everything yet.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So like in the
liver-healing study

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.720 align:middle line:84%
where the kind of
staining for those slides

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been well used
because it's new,

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.930 align:middle line:84%
some kind of measure that hasn't
yet been invented at the time

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:84%
that you got measured
can be the one

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.990 align:middle line:90%
that changes retro-causally.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.938 align:middle line:84%
So I think, don't
worry about it,

00:44:03.938 --> 00:44:05.480 align:middle line:84%
just that medical
science isn't going

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.450 align:middle line:84%
to be as exhaustive
as you think it is.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Or these tests are going to
take a long time to come back.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, the 10-day waiting
period, during that 10 days,

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:16.130 align:middle line:90%
now you have this time.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So there is that part of myself
says, oh no, in 50 years,

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:21.760 align:middle line:84%
are we going to say
we were hurting people

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.640 align:middle line:84%
by making these measurements
and not using time travel

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.560 align:middle line:90%
therapies to fix them first?

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe, but I doubt it.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.082 align:middle line:84%
I think probably
more likely, we're

00:44:31.082 --> 00:44:33.040 align:middle line:84%
going to realize that
there is always something

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.570 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been measured.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.340 align:middle line:84%
At the last minute
you could say,

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, your
spine was severed,

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.267 align:middle line:90%
all these horrible things.

00:44:39.267 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:90%
This is the way the x-ray looks.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a disaster.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out
they didn't measure

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.270 align:middle line:84%
this one particular
portion of your spine.

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:49.690 align:middle line:84%
There is always something
that's incomplete and can

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:50.673 align:middle line:90%
be influenced.

00:44:50.673 --> 00:44:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Or they didn't measure
this other part of you

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that is actually the
healer within that's going

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.790 align:middle line:90%
to allow for this to unfold.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:58.750 align:middle line:90%
It's all unfolding--

00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Absolutely

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --in right time,
yeah, in perfect order.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So what about negative side
effects or other applications

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:90%
of this temporceuticals idea?

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm all in with this, but what
if someone that's watching

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.912 align:middle line:84%
is afraid of stepping out
of this present moment,

00:45:19.912 --> 00:45:22.120 align:middle line:84%
because I've never really
thought about this so much?

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our viewers are very
open, and very interested,

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and very bright people who are
taking charge of their lives

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:31.610 align:middle line:90%
in so many wonderful ways.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
want to address any concerns

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.155 align:middle line:84%
that they might have about
what about stepping out

00:45:38.155 --> 00:45:40.780 align:middle line:84%
of this present moment, going to
the future, going to the past?

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Is there any kind
of negative side

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.860 align:middle line:84%
effect of doing that
you've seen at all?

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: I want to say, no.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But as a scientist,
I have to say,

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.600 align:middle line:90%
there has got to be something.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.980 align:middle line:90%
The thing that I think of--

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems so
positive for most people

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.090 align:middle line:84%
when they're noticing
that they're having

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:57.370 align:middle line:90%
a positive experience doing it.

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.550 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's the key.

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that, for some
people, if they're not

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.430 align:middle line:84%
having a positive experience
doing it, that's a sign.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Like, don't do it.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.980 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe do do it, but
do it differently.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's a sign
that what you are doing

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.150 align:middle line:84%
isn't right for
you, but maybe there

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:90%
is a way to do it differently.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Usually those are
cases of where there

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.550 align:middle line:84%
is such a big
imagined difference

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.590 align:middle line:84%
between the present moment
and this future self.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're fantasizing
about this future self so much

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.610 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.037 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lack of self-love
and self-acknowledgment

00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.120 align:middle line:90%
that right now is OK, too.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It could make one feel
more compressed or depressed

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.110 align:middle line:84%
in this present moment if this
future self is so radically

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:40.210 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, I, when I'm
working with students

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:45.070 align:middle line:84%
in my coursework, et cetera,
I'm saying, you know,

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:46.960 align:middle line:90%
when in doubt, default to love.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Just love more.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:49.990 align:middle line:84%
If you start to
feel fear, you start

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.210 align:middle line:84%
to feel uncomfortable
about something,

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:55.000 align:middle line:84%
just drop into this
self-loving state,

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:84%
or just being present
with yourself,

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that it that it generates
the vibration, the energetic

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking for for this
to have a beneficial effect,

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.850 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.392 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah,
I've never seen--

00:47:05.392 --> 00:47:07.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I don't know about you.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:08.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a doctor.

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a negative
side effect of love.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.327 align:middle line:90%
I've just never seen that.

00:47:13.327 --> 00:47:15.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, the person
may die, but if they're

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.470 align:middle line:84%
experiencing love, that's
still a positive thing.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, it's a
pleasant transition

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.010 align:middle line:90%
in the influence of love.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Speaking of love, love banking--

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Talk to us.

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: One of
my favorite things.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I like to make up new
terminology, as you can tell.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, that's a good one.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.845 align:middle line:84%
They can check their love bank,
make a deposit in my love bank.

00:47:35.845 --> 00:47:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah, open
my checking account.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.800 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's super simple.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.100 align:middle line:84%
It's this idea that, in
those times in your life

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.990 align:middle line:84%
when you feel like you have
extra resources-- you know,

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.490 align:middle line:84%
some days you just wake
up and you're like, wow,

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.402 align:middle line:90%
it's a great day.

00:47:46.402 --> 00:47:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have
extra resources.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I have extra energy.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Things feel like
they're going well.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm enjoying whatever the
universe is offering me today--

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to take a moment and
say, like, great,

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.878 align:middle line:84%
now I'm going to do a
little love banking.

00:47:57.878 --> 00:47:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I started doing this in my 40s.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:02.850 align:middle line:84%
That's how I ended up at the
bedside of my childhood self,

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:03.970 align:middle line:90%
because I was like, great.

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.680 align:middle line:90%
I have a little extra energy.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go and
sit there and be with--

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.340 align:middle line:84%
so what you do is, you
imagine time like fabric,

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.350 align:middle line:90%
like a fabric of space time.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And you sort of put a flag
in the present moment.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.780 align:middle line:84%
This is my present moment
of awesome experience.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.260 align:middle line:90%
I feel great.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you sort of
put a flag in the past

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.390 align:middle line:84%
where you had a hard time
and you could use some love.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine a
love bank up here.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And you sort of say,
I'm going to put some--

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm making a deposit
into the love bank.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So any time, but maybe
especially this time

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.770 align:middle line:84%
where the flag is, anytime
can withdraw from that bank

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:43.780 align:middle line:90%
when it's needed.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't have to
worry about this part,

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:47.655 align:middle line:90%
because this will get done.

00:48:47.655 --> 00:48:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And just give yourself
that permission.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.050 align:middle line:90%
You just do this deposit.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And then later, the next day you
wake up and you're like, wait,

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:57.035 align:middle line:84%
everything is the same, but I
feel horrible, as we often do.

00:48:57.035 --> 00:48:57.835 align:middle line:90%
You wake up.

00:48:57.835 --> 00:49:00.530 align:middle line:90%
And now I don't like my day.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, oh, I'm
withdrawing from the love bank.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And you just keep doing that.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And it continues
not only to create

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.970 align:middle line:84%
a relationship between
your selves in time,

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:14.577 align:middle line:90%
but it also evens out your days.

00:49:14.577 --> 00:49:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Right, you have extra,
you put it up in the bank.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.910 align:middle line:84%
You have a deficit, you
draw down from the bank.

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.368 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah,
it's your love.

00:49:20.368 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Uploading, yes.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: And
you can trust it.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's just for
people who have been

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.772 align:middle line:90%
abused as children or whatever.

00:49:24.772 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a big deal to
have someone's love

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.070 align:middle line:90%
that you can trust.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you get to
the point where

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:34.320 align:middle line:84%
you can trust yourself to do
that, that's hugely healing.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Then you start to trust others.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:38.627 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So tell us about the
book that you're writing

00:49:38.627 --> 00:49:39.710 align:middle line:90%
about all of these topics.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Just share.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I know people are going to
be so fascinated and very

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.000 align:middle line:84%
interested to learn
more, read more.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Just speak to us
about your book.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: OK, great.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So the working title is
"Practical Time Travel

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.645 align:middle line:84%
for Everyday Mystics,"
which just came to me.

00:49:54.645 --> 00:49:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: For everyday--

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.978 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: For
everyday mystics.

00:49:56.978 --> 00:49:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mystics, fabulous, great.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Right, and
so I'm working on it now.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be both
stories like the kinds

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked about
here, about people doing

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.830 align:middle line:84%
this kind of practical time
travel to work with a problem,

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.630 align:middle line:84%
or help heal themselves in the
past, or influence the future,

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:13.870 align:middle line:90%
however that is.

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But it will also go into
the science more deeply.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.228 align:middle line:84%
And by the time the
book is written,

00:50:20.228 --> 00:50:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll have the
results of both the liver--

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.770 align:middle line:84%
or be well on the way to the
results of the liver study

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:27.380 align:middle line:84%
as well as this
study with groups

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.440 align:middle line:84%
of people in support groups
that are dealing with addiction,

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and trauma,
incarceration, poverty,

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.980 align:middle line:84%
and helping them do these
time-travel narratives.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So it'll be coming at
it from all angles.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.820 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
goal of the book

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.460 align:middle line:84%
is to introduce to the
United States and the rest

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.010 align:middle line:84%
of the world this idea
of time-travel therapies

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:51.170 align:middle line:84%
in a scientific, fun,
accessible context for people

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:54.140 align:middle line:84%
who are interested in other
ways of looking at things

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.730 align:middle line:90%
and other ways of healing.

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And this is on
every level of their life?

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Healing mentally,
healing emotionally,

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:02.090 align:middle line:84%
healing physically,
healing spiritual crises--

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:05.930 align:middle line:84%
all of it is addressable by
what you're speaking about.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: I think so.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Will the book have
practical applications?

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, break it down for
people, do some of this.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.870 align:middle line:90%
And try some of this.

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And here are some
therapies that have been--

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:14.307 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Yeah,
I want to have

00:51:14.307 --> 00:51:17.147 align:middle line:84%
an appendix that has all
that, just examples of,

00:51:17.147 --> 00:51:18.230 align:middle line:90%
just here is a meditation.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Try this.

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.680 align:middle line:10%
Personalize this for yourself,
just so people could do it.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.950 align:middle line:10%
But also, if it's in
the text of the book,

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:28.280 align:middle line:10%
it will get filed as
self-help rather than science.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.188 align:middle line:84%
It will reach a
different audience--

00:51:30.188 --> 00:51:32.470 align:middle line:90%
so appendix.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interesting.

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:35.062 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well wonderful,
as long as it's there.

00:51:35.062 --> 00:51:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I know our viewers are
going to be interested in,

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:38.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, show me what to do.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:40.580 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
break it down to.

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So how can people find out
more information from you?

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.890 align:middle line:90%
How can they find more now?

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.390 align:middle line:10%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: One
of the best places

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:10%
to find out what I'm doing
is to go to my organization,

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.790 align:middle line:10%
mossbridgeinstitute.com.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.830 align:middle line:10%
And I have multiple
organizations and projects

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:56.122 align:middle line:10%
that kind of feed off of there.

00:51:56.122 --> 00:51:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you sign up for the
newsletter, periodically,

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.945 align:middle line:84%
not very often,
maybe every couple

00:51:59.945 --> 00:52:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of months I send out a like,
this is what I'm doing,

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:04.970 align:middle line:84%
are you interested
kind of email.

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fabulous.

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for the work
that you're doing in the world.

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:11.120 align:middle line:84%
It's this kind of
thinking outside

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.970 align:middle line:84%
of the box that is
so necessary for us

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:17.840 align:middle line:84%
to evolve as we truly
are meant to be evolving,

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and to be the true
healers that we each are.

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Your work is fascinating.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thrilled.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for spending
some time with us today.

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: Thank you.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Hundreds of
years ago, humans

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.820 align:middle line:84%
understood radical
healing as miraculous,

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.890 align:middle line:84%
but now we are
beginning to understand

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:38.060 align:middle line:84%
that each phenomena is not
only scientifically possible,

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.710 align:middle line:84%
but also is a stepping
stone in a paradigm shift

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.740 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness in healing.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.670 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Mossbridge suggests that
in the not too distant future,

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.730 align:middle line:10%
practical time travel
may be an effective tool

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:53.300 align:middle line:10%
for our wellness,
mind, body, and spirit.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
watching "Healing Matrix."

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.462 align:middle line:90%
