>>SUE MORTER: Are you tired
of going to 30 doctors

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:10%
to try and figure
out what is causing

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:10%
yours or your loved ones
chronic illness only to hear,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:10%
they don't know what's wrong?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Or are you just wanting
to get to the root

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
of what your body is
all about and how it's

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:90%

Dr. Jill Carnahan
knows this firsthand,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
as she's beaten the odds with
not one death sentence but two.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Dr. Jill,
to "Healing Matrix."

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JILL CARNAHAN:
Thank you, Dr. Sue.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Let's dig right in.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened in your
third year of medical school.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.560 align:middle line:10%
So I always say, I
was born to overcome.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:10%
Because I was going
along living my life,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:10%
pursuing my dream of becoming
a functional medicine

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:10%
doctor in allopathic
medical school,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:10%
and during my third year, I
found a lump in my breast.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly-- I did not actually
think it was anything serious.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:10%
But as I talked to friends and
family, everyone, of course,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:10%
encouraged me to
get it checked out.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:10%
So I did.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:10%
And when you're in medical
school, your medical doctors,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:10%
the gyne oncologist
that help me,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.102 align:middle line:10%
they're not only colleagues,
but their friends and teachers.

00:01:38.102 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
personal experience,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:84%
because I knew them as
faculty, and this and that.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So I went ahead and had an
ultrasound and a mammogram.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I remember very clearly sitting
next to the radiologist right

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:90%
to my side.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:10%
You know, when you're
a student you're always

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.968 align:middle line:10%
looking for teaching
opportunities,

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:10%
so this was no different.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:10%
I said, can look at my films
with you, as I sat beside him.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, show me
what you're seeing.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell he
was a little nervous.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:10%
And I knew something was up when
his voice cracked and he said,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:10%
Jill, you know,
you're 25, but if this

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:10%
were a 55-year-old woman,
these classifications

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:10%
are highly indicative
of aggressive cancer.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And I paused, just
like we did here.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.353 align:middle line:90%
And I knew--

00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very intuitive person.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I knew at that moment that
something was not right.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.685 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You knew what was coming.

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:26.102 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And
yet, I don't think

00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I had the comprehension at that
point of what was in store.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:90%
So I had that.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, with
an abnormal mammogram,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:90%
you need a biopsy.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.248 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a biopsy,
again with a surgeon who

00:02:34.248 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:90%
is also a colleague and friend.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:10%
Three days after the surgery,
she called me at my home

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:10%
on my cell phone
and said, Jill, I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:10%
don't know how to tell you this,
but you have breast cancer.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very aggressive.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest grade
of cells possible, which

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:90%
means they're rapidly dividing.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:10%
They're about as
aggressive as they get.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And in young women,
breast cancer

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:90%
is a whole different ballgame.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I was in a group in
Chicago, after my diagnosis,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
of 12 women under 40.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:90%
I was one of the youngest.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And I am the only one of
those 12 still living.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So this was-- I didn't even
know what I was headed into,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:90%
but I knew that it was serious.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And I buckled down for
the battle of my life.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I have always
had a very strong faith.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And a very large
part of my healing

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
was prayer, was
people from my church

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and my family surrounding
me praying for me,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
taking care of me,
loving me through it.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:90%
And just even the sense of--

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I love the work
of Viktor Frankl,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
because he talks about how the
will is the indomitable part

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:90%
of the human spirit and how--

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I say I was
born to overcome,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.513 align:middle line:84%
God gave me a gift of
a very strong will.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And what that meant was there
was never a doubt in my mind

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:90%
that I could overcome it.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Even though I faced
the fear of surgery,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.913 align:middle line:84%
and losing all my hair through
radiation and chemotherapy,

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and all the things I
had to go through--

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
they were painful
and difficult--

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.067 align:middle line:84%
but my internal will was never
broken and never once wavered.

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of that
is due to my faith in God

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and the strength that he
gave me through that time.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:90%
So I got the diagnosis.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to
face the journey

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:90%
with treatment and decisions.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I definitely
want to speak

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
into this perspective
of your unwavering

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
will and your faith that played
a role in your healing process.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously been a big
part of your entire regime.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's just stop
and make sure that we clarify.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So you got this diagnosis.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And overnight, you went
from doctor to patient.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And you found yourself
going into traditional means

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of response to this
kind of diagnosis.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with us a little
bit about that experience?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.287 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting, because
my first thought was, oh,

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
this won't effect my life.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.787 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep
going to school,

00:04:49.787 --> 00:04:51.550 align:middle line:90%
and it will not stop me.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm also very stubborn,
which is part of that will.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And it has served
me well many times

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and gotten me into
trouble other times, but--

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Good news,
not so good news.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Exactly.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But the stubbornness
is part of that will.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.968 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, gosh darn
it, this is not going

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:90%
to keep me-- hold me back.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Very soon through treatment,
I realized there was no way.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.205 align:middle line:90%
It made me so sick.

00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I had to take
a medical leave of absence

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.415 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the decision,
one of the most profound things

00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
for your listeners to
understand-- because they all

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%
know someone, themselves
or family members

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
or friends who've gone
through cancer or treatments,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.335 align:middle line:84%
and we think it's
black and white.

00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
difficult things about it

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is, here I was in one of
the best medical schools

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:84%
in the country, had a
medical education behind me,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and I looked at the
options for treatment,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and I was so confused
and overwhelmed.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was with a
medical background.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So I have such compassion
for the patients who

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.943 align:middle line:90%
are faced with their diagnosis.

00:05:40.943 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to decide what to do.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And especially if they
have conventional options

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and integrative and holistic
and functional medicine options

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
in deciding how
to implement that.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I literally went through
stacks and stacks

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
of research trying to figure
out what was the best option.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And even then, there's no
black and white answers.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:84%
What I knew is that my cancer
was extremely aggressive,

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and that if I didn't
act fast and swiftly

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.002 align:middle line:90%
that it could take my life.

00:06:07.002 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So with that knowledge, I went
into conventional treatment.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I did basically the
full-fledged, three-drug

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:90%
chemotherapy for six rounds.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I was telling someone earlier,
I basically had the maximum

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
cardiotoxic-- which means the
amount that could just take

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
your heart to the edge
before it stops beating--

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.897 align:middle line:84%
of one of the drugs
and of the radiation.

00:06:24.897 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:90%
So they went right to the edge--

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Maxed you out.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: --the
calculated dose

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
of what I could tolerate before
my heart would stop beating.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And they gave me that dose.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was both the
chemotherapy and the radiation.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:90%
So I went into it knowing that.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:90%
And I also knew--

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I was always a fan of
more natural options.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I went into medical school
wanting to change the system

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and learn options
for natural healing.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So that was my heart
even before cancer.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But as I was faced
with this diagnosis,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I had to actually apply
it to my own life.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And I had to decide.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And I decided conventional,
but a lot of the healing

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
took place later with the
alternative and holistic types

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
of treatments.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interesting.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine being
in this moment where

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
you, like everyone else that
gets a diagnosis such as this,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
so many options
are thrown at you,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:90%
you have to make a decision.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Do I do this?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Or do I try do some
of these other things?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So in all of that, and in
your decision-making process,

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
what do you feel was the
most important component

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:90%
in your plan to heal?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.905 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What happened?

00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Every
step of my life, God

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
has given me
discernment and wisdom.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:90%
And I so often--

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm a natural planner.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of a type A. I have
a five-year, 10-year plans

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and goals.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But the more and
more God gives me

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:84%
things that are either
difficult or not expected,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
the more I step back and just
say, God, whatever you want,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I will do and I will
follow you and you will--

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And he always, always gives
me the answers and the people

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:90%
and the resources.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I have so many
stories of miracles.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:90%
This was one of the big ones.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember in the very
first week of my diagnosis,

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I was listening to the radio.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Some podcast came on.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And the person was
quoting from scripture.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And it said, the sickness
will not end in death,

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:84%
but it's for the glory
of God that his son

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:90%
might be glorified.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And it cut me to the heart.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:90%
I stopped breathing.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I wasn't
going to die.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:90%
I knew.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And I knew, this is before.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have a platform,
and I can teach,

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and I have lots of impact in
the world because of my story.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:84%
At that moment at
25, I had no idea

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:90%
what God had in store for me.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
But what I knew is I knew
that will he gave me was my--

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
my faith and my will was
my ability to overcome this

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and that he would
use it for a purpose.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And the universal
principle there

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:84%
is that suffering, if
we can take it as such,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:90%
has purpose and value.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.039 align:middle line:84%
And if we can take it and
use it to inspire and impact

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:84%
other lives, then it
has purpose and meaning.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
If we have suffering and
we don't take it and use it

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and harvest it for the good
of other people later on,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:90%
it has no meaning.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's horrible to go through.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:90%
And I lost all my hair.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I was the lowest weight I'd
been since 13 years old.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I was sick, I was malnourished.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:90%
It was not pleasant.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the most painful
experiences of my life.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But because I knew
from day seven

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
that I was not going
to die and that God

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:84%
was going to use it for
a purpose, which he has,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.232 align:middle line:84%
I was able to go
through all of that,

00:09:14.232 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:84%
knowing that there
was an end point

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.482 align:middle line:84%
and there was something
greater at the end.

00:09:17.482 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Did you feel that the
weight loss and coming down

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to that frail state was
because of the cancer

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.845 align:middle line:90%
or because of the treatment?

00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I love this
question, because so often

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:90%
people don't really understand.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:90%
The cancer was easy.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.347 align:middle line:90%
It was so easy to beat.

00:09:32.347 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I probably-- who
knows if I could have

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
beat it or not even without
all the extensive treatments.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But what I've covered
the last 17 years from

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:90%
is the treatment of the cancer.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:90%
It was toxic chemotherapeutic--

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
These are like agents that
are used in chemical warfare

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:90%
at times.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very toxic.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're toxic to all
rapidly dividing cells, which

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:90%
means your reproductive organs.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.825 align:middle line:90%
It means your gut lining.

00:09:54.825 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle line:90%
It means your brain.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It means your skin.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it devastates many-- it's
like a atomic bomb going off

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and creating--

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.885 align:middle line:84%
It might kill the cancer
cells, but it really

00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
creates a lot of
collateral damage.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's almost as if the
cancer doesn't kill you, the--

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Exactly.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --chemotherapy will.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.923 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Exactly.

00:10:09.923 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So something has
to land that we overcome

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:84%
this entire regime,
the entire combination

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of the original illness and
then this toxic approach

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:90%
to the treatment.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to ask
something about your faith

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and this relationship
with God that you

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
feel has had such a beautiful
role in your recovery.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Was there any
reconciliation for you

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
that you had to come
to that if God was here

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to help in the
healing process, was

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
God not available beforehand
that allowed my system

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.350 align:middle line:90%
to get sick in the first place?

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
What was that
reconciliation for you?

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.962 align:middle line:90%
What happened for you in that?

00:10:51.962 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Well, you know, I
know a lot of people struggle

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:90%
with that question.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have such compassion,
because it's so real.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that God
can allow suffering

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:90%
is hard to grapple with.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember, as a
very young girl,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I was in situations that
were not healthy and somewhat

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:90%
abusive.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
very young knowing

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that God was the one that
I could always rely on.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%
And for me, it was so powerful.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Probably like 3,
4, 5, 6 years old,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I had this sense of who God
was and that he was always

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:90%
going to be there for me.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I've
never wavered in that.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:90%
I've never doubted his goodness.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And so even in the midst
of tragedy and pain

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and suffering and a
terminal diagnosis,

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.760 align:middle line:90%
my question wasn't, why God?

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
It was, God, what do you
want to do with this?

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And how can you use
this in my life?

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So it was a searching
for meaning.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like
Frankl, again--

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Sure.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: --meaning.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It was searching
for meaning in it.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:90%
And once you find--

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.792 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Turn this into
something beneficial,

00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:49.477 align:middle line:84%
turn this into something that is
going to serve me and everyone.

00:11:49.477 --> 00:11:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Others, right.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea,
because again now it's

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.802 align:middle line:84%
easy to look back
and say, of course.

00:11:53.802 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But God was preparing
me for what he had

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:90%
in store, which is made my--

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:84%
the health practitioner
and the ability

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:84%
to inspire other
practitioners and patients.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.227 align:middle line:84%
But the stories are
a core part of it.

00:12:05.227 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:90%
So I had to go through it.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Here with "Healing Matrix,"
what we're looking for is,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.410 align:middle line:84%
how do we get sick, and
how can we prevent it,

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and how do we live not
in a way of prevention

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.320 align:middle line:90%
but in robust vitality?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:84%
How do we just come forward
living in our fullness,

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
so that illness isn't even
really in the picture?

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I noticed something
when you were describing,

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and in some of the materials
that I was reading beforehand

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to get to know you a little bit,
that you described your life as

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
very organized, and you had a
plan, and you were very strong

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:90%
will.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:41.475 align:middle line:84%
And I'm curious if you feel that
that taking life by the reins

00:12:41.475 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and driving and making things
happen the way that they're

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle line:84%
supposed to, if you feel that
that played any role in maybe

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.930 align:middle line:84%
exhausting your system or
having you feel disconnected

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:84%
to this support of the
divine, of the universe,

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
or of God, however
we reference that.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Was there an
isolated separateness

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
that you felt at that
time before the diagnosis

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
that you no longer feel because
you opened and surrendered

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:90%
in some way?

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.422 align:middle line:90%
Was there any kind of--

00:13:07.422 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to
that relationship?

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.047 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: I would love to.

00:13:10.047 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm a recovering
perfectionist and a little bit

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:90%
of a control freak.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I understand.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.773 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And of course, that
got me through medical school,

00:13:16.773 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
because was so driven and
very driven with grades

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:90%
and academics and all that.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But what I found is--
the one word that

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
came to mind as you're
speaking is surrender.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Over and over again, surrender.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I've just come to
this point of I know,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it over and
over again that God's plan

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:90%
is better than my plan.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And as I surrender,
miracles happen.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've just seen it over
and over and over again.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
God brings the people, the
love, the beauty, the things

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:90%
that I have always wanted.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.883 align:middle line:84%
But it's not me grappling
and making it happen.

00:13:45.883 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
It's me letting
go and saying, OK,

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
God, your time and your will,
how do you see this in my life?

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And he brings literally miracles
every day the more I surrender.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I'm going to show up.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: But I'm open to all--

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Exactly

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --the facilitation
and assistance.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: But I'm going to show up.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not going to believe
that it's up to me only.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's--

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And think about
the weight we carried.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:90%
I carry that weight.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I carried this
weight on my shoulder

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
that it was all
my responsibility,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and that if I failed, the
world would fall apart.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
that's ridiculous.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But now I've really realized
it's my responsibility

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to show up every day, do my
best, make no assumptions,

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.210 align:middle line:84%
all of the four agreements
really is what I live by.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But all of those things come
from a place of surrender

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that
whatever happens,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
even if I'm stuck in traffic,
I'm late to an appointment,

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:90%
God has a purpose.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.737 align:middle line:84%
He might be protecting me for
something I didn't even see.

00:14:33.737 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So there is something called
the iron law of cancer.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
familiar with that.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But some German research that
years ago in the '80s there was

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.480 align:middle line:84%
research that has then been
re-researched since stating

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:84%
that in the cases of 40,000
patients studied that a couple

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:90%
of years--

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
1 and 1/2 to 2 and 1/2 years
prior to their diagnosis--

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that there was some
unrelenting, emotional impact,

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%
something deeply stressful
for an individual that

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:90%
impacted their whole system.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And then 1 year and 1/2
to 2 and 1/2 years later,

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:84%
these diagnoses start
surfacing in their lives.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And just-- it's
considered quackery

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:90%
by some cancer surgeons.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the alternative
health care arena

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
has been working
with this for decades

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
now and finding that there
is true transformation that

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:84%
can occur when we
connect the dots inside.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just wondering if
you have any comment on it.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything
like this in your life?

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Was it the stress
of medical school?

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything that you
felt was [GRUNTS] really

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:90%
got you to the bone?

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Well, yes.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because
medical school was brutal.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.393 align:middle line:84%
But it was before the
work hour regulations,

00:15:44.393 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and we would do 36-hour shifts
in a heartbeat with no sleep.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And just physically,
mentally, emotionally, it

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:90%
was very taxing.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.328 align:middle line:90%
I had gotten married at 21.

00:15:52.328 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I got married, I
inherited three stepchildren.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had a wonderful ex-husband
and wonderful children,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.290 align:middle line:84%
but that was lot
to take on at 21.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:10%
So if you can
imagine, a lot of that

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:10%
was just inheriting
three children,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:10%
helping to raise them, doing
medical school full time.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It was a lot.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.573 align:middle line:84%
And the breast cancer,
I have learned since,

00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot of women with breast
cancer, there's this nurturing.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.316 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:16:12.316 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Right?

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.177 align:middle line:90%
And I was the nurturer.

00:16:14.177 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And I gave and gave and gave and
didn't have great boundaries.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think in a sense, like
what I've learned since then,

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
is the balance of giving
and receiving, and often

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:84%
even letting someone, allowing
them to give to you is a gift

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.797 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm always about
giving, giving, giving

00:16:28.797 --> 00:16:30.828 align:middle line:84%
and not receiving, I'm
taking away their joy.

00:16:30.828 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And gets out of balance.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: It gets
out of balance.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: For you.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.497 align:middle line:84%
And anytime we're
out of balance--

00:16:34.497 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I work with energy
medicine and bioenergetics

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and that everything is
vibrational frequency.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.942 align:middle line:90%
And if we're not--

00:16:39.942 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
if we're over-giving in
nurturing and we're not

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
receiving, then the aspects
of us that are our nurturing

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:84%
tissues, our vibrational
components that represent

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.260 align:middle line:84%
our own nurturing self become
compromised, which is--

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes, which is
breast, of course, health.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --the ovaries, the
womb, the breasts, et cetera,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:84%
are our nurturing
components physically.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit about
how you repaired your body.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
You get to this point, you
came through all of this.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point, you took ahold

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and you started doing
something differently.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with
us what that was?

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: I can.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.847 align:middle line:84%
When I did the chemotherapy,
and even the radiation,

00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
I sought out very
specific environments.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.770 align:middle line:84%
One, with the chemotherapy
was a center where they also

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
had naturopathic,
they had nutrition,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
they had pastoral care,
ministry, and prayer.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So I had the conventional
drug, but I also

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.827 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of other things around
me even during the treatment.

00:17:29.827 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:10%
But like you said, I came out
of there and I was malnourished,

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.205 align:middle line:10%
I was bald, which
I love to share.

00:17:34.205 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:90%
There's another word.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Bald is so not fun to
say, but "glaborious,"

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:38.908 align:middle line:90%
which is hairless.

00:17:38.908 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
It's so much nicer to
say I'm "glaborious."

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: "Glaborious."

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: "Glaborious."

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.283 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Beautiful in
your "glaborious."

00:17:43.283 --> 00:17:46.145 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Which is hairless,
but still it sounds better.

00:17:46.145 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:90%
So I would always say that.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
But I came out of
there very, very thin,

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:84%
lost a lot of muscle
mass, very sick.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And my gut was
profoundly affected,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
as most people are with
chemotherapy, because there's

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
lots of rapidly dividing cells.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So I dug into, what does it
take to actually heal the cells?

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I did a lot of nutritional
therapies, naturopathy.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:90%
I did acupuncture.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I did massage, lots of
different things in the realm.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel like it
took in maybe 10 or 12 years

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:90%
to heal from the toxic drugs.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.165 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Hm, I understand.

00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
patients for 30 years.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I see.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:90%
So you complete your treatment.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:90%
And you get back into school.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And you're beginning again.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.075 align:middle line:84%
And six months later,
something happens.

00:18:31.075 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.898 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Will you
share that with us?

00:18:32.898 --> 00:18:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: I sure will.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:90%
So I remember being rotation.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:90%
I was in ER rotation.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So the shifts are all night
long and different hours.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And I had just
gotten off my leave.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.415 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, I'm
going to go back and finish.

00:18:42.415 --> 00:18:44.060 align:middle line:90%
I had a little over a year left.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And I remember working
these shifts with 102 fever.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I was sick, I was so sick.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:90%
And I was not-- no one knew.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.523 align:middle line:84%
I was stoic there
and just kind of--

00:18:52.523 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and I knew something
wasn't quite right,

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
but I assumed it was
all the chemotherapy

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and what I had
just been through.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:90%
But I continued to deteriorate.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I had more weight loss,
abdominal pain, diarrhea,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:90%
bleeding.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.903 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I had
to get it checked out.

00:19:04.903 --> 00:19:07.292 align:middle line:84%
And I was given a diagnosis
of Crohn's disease, which

00:19:07.292 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
is, again, another
life-threatening, autoimmune

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:90%
illness.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
what in the world?

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:90%
What now?

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.323 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt in my mind
now it was all connected.

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk a little later
about autoimmunity and all

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:90%
those different connections.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
But the chemotherapy
was a trigger

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle line:84%
that took me into active
Crohn's disease right

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.995 align:middle line:90%
after the chemotherapy.

00:19:24.995 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So for our
viewers, can you just

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
explain what Crohn's disease is
and what your experience of it

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:90%
even after the diagnosis was?

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So our
bowel nourishes us.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
We're interfacing with our
environment through the bowel.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.195 align:middle line:84%
That's really the
only way we interface

00:19:39.195 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
with our mucosal layer
through the environment.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, that
attack of chemotherapy

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%
had a profound effect on that.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Crohn's disease
is basically when

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.350 align:middle line:84%
some trigger, like chemotherapy
or abnormal microbiome,

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
starts to cause your
body to attack self.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And in the case of--

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So this could be any
autoimmune disease.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.235 align:middle line:84%
It could be
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:19:57.235 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:84%
which attacks joints,
MS, which attacks

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:90%
brain and nervous system.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.700 align:middle line:84%
In my case, Crohn's, the
body attacks the gut lining.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So it creates these sores
and ulcers basically all

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.718 align:middle line:90%
along the GI tract.

00:20:07.718 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So typically, people will
have weight loss, pain,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:90%
malnutrition, lots of bleeding.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:90%
And it can be fatal.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think about
the nourishment and lack

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
of nourishment, if
that's not happening,

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.650 align:middle line:90%
you can die from this disease.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So your
gastroenterologist

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
is obviously working
with you in this moment,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and trying to come up with
solutions, and telling you

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
what is important
and what isn't now

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:90%
in this new moment of your life.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:90%
What did they say?

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
What did they do for
you in that moment?

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I still remember the
room-- and again,

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
it's a colleague that taught
our lectures in medical school--

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
sitting next to
him, and he tells me

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.088 align:middle line:90%
I have Crohn's disease.

00:20:40.088 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Jill, this
is a lifelong illness.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:43.873 align:middle line:90%
It's incurable.

00:20:43.873 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have it
the rest of your life.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Our options right
now are steroids.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:90%
We can do that now.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:84%
We also have
immune-modulating drugs

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.988 align:middle line:90%
if the steroids don't work.

00:20:51.988 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:84%
You're probably
going to have surgery

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.363 align:middle line:84%
throughout your life
for different resection

00:20:55.363 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:90%
parts of the bowel.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Because as they get
damaged, sometimes you just

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:90%
have to cut them out.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind
of looked at him.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.462 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very intuitive.

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And even though I didn't know
all the answers as third year

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:84%
medical school student, I still
knew, gosh, this doesn't seem--

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:90%
I think I can overcome this too.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.452 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, it doesn't
sound like a very good plan.

00:21:12.452 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: But it
didn't sound good, right?

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't like the idea of
lifelong drugs and surgery--

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You bet.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.542 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: --and
immune-modulating agents.

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But I remember thinking,
maybe food could do it.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Food's really good.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:90%
And I knew--

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.342 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to do nutrition.

00:21:23.342 --> 00:21:25.457 align:middle line:84%
And I ask him, I
said, what about diet?

00:21:25.457 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Does diet have
anything to do with it?

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me point-blank,
leaned over, and said, Jill,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
diet has nothing
to do with this.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
moment I fired him.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wait.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Diet has nothing to do--

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Nothing
to do with this.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what you're putting
in your body has nothing to do--

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, has
nothing to do with this.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.388 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --with your
body's ability to heal

00:21:42.388 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
or how this irritation,
inflammation is being set up

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and continuing.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Really.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what--

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I felt like--

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And you knew.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: --I
didn't know anything.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:84%
But my intuitive self
was like, you are--

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to prove you wrong.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:84%
That was the stubborn
Jill coming up and saying,

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to prove you wrong.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.206 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This is where the good
news part of stubborn Jill.

00:21:58.206 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I was
like, I am not--

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show this
guy that there is a way.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had no clue
what I was doing.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:90%
But I dove into the literature.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:84%
By God's grace, I came across
Elaine Gottschall's Specific

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Carbohydrate Diet, which
had been shown to reverse

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:90%
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny,
part of my story is

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:90%
I had become vegetarian at 14.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I was from a farming family
in the Midwest, steak

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:90%
and potatoes.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And some reason, I-- now I
know, because when you're born

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and you have poor digestion
due to stress levels,

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
you often don't produce
enough stomach acid,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:90%
you're low in zinc.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.938 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
factors contribute

00:22:29.938 --> 00:22:31.127 align:middle line:90%
to lack of taste for meat.

00:22:31.127 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there was other
physiological things that

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:90%
led me to being vegetarian.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I was vegetarian
from 14 to 25.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And part of my story
is that diet for me

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:84%
almost killed me, because I
gravitated towards a heavier

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:90%
carb diet.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And unbeknownst to me, I
also had celiac disease.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So gluten was a very
toxic trigger for me.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was eating
lots of gluten, lots

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
of like soy-based vegetable
products that were not healthy.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:90%
So all of that kind of led up.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And then when I found the
Specific Carbohydrate Diet,

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:90%
I made that change.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:90%
The profound thing was this.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks, two weeks into
the Specific Carbohydrate

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Diet, my symptoms were gone.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Two weeks?

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Two weeks.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You change your diet,
even though it had nothing

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.720 align:middle line:90%
to do with your condition.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:90%
And two weeks later--

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Symptoms gone.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What symptoms were gone?

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.407 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So the bleeding,
the pain, the diarrhea.

00:23:15.407 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't cured.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
It took me several
years to really heal.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:90%
But the symptoms--

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: But we knew you
were on to something.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I know, I'm like, diet does
have something to do with it.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Turns out.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.617 align:middle line:90%
So that was my first awakening.

00:23:25.617 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I had gone into
medical school wanting

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to do nutrition and wellness
and holistic medicine.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But that was my own
personal experience

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.716 align:middle line:90%
with the profound power of food.

00:23:36.716 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So where are you now
with this Crohn's condition?

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.672 align:middle line:84%
How does that register
in your consciousness?

00:23:41.672 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:90%
What role is it in your life?

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Are you completely recovered?

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.085 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:23:45.085 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So they
consider it incurable.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.963 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny, if I ever post--

00:23:47.963 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I've written articles and
Twitter and things like that--

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.210 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I'll
say about my cure,

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:84%
here's how I cured my Crohn's
disease, people get so angry.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe they
want to be the victim,

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.220 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
believe it's cured.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I have zero symptoms, zero
evidence of the disease.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not in remission.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:90%
It is completely gone.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.153 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So they say it's
incurable, but you say--

00:24:08.153 --> 00:24:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: It's gone.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --I'm cured.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And I have
no doubt in my mind.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I'm OK.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK for me to be OK?

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.023 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Exactly.

00:24:13.023 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I understand that
when we get a diagnosis,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:90%
it seems like a relief.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we attach
to that diagnosis.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And the longer we hold
onto the diagnosis,

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:84%
the longer we have to
present in accordance

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.975 align:middle line:84%
with what the prognosis is that
goes along with that diagnosis.

00:24:26.975 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Absolutely.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so what
you did was break

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:90%
through that whole paradigm.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And you said, you know, I don't
know if it's curable or not,

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to do this,
because it sounds smarter,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.420 align:middle line:90%
feels better to me.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:90%
You do it.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, your
symptoms are gone.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:90%
You're still asymptomatic.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you let go of
having this disease,

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:84%
because you knew
there was something

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:90%
else you could count on.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Absolutely.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Sounds like it's
a combination of trusting

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:84%
your own gut and trusting
your faith in a higher

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
vibrational frequency,
whether it's

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
universal intelligence, the
god source energy, however,

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.715 align:middle line:90%
anyone would believe.

00:25:05.715 --> 00:25:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're combining
those things

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and living a robust life.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:10.755 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:25:10.755 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Thank you.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's a beautiful thing.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: It really is.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor, really, to
be in conversation with you

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:84%
about this very
deep life experience

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that so many of our
viewers go through as well.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And so as you put
it all together,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and you've found a way of
working with your own life

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:84%
experience, you found
a way of helping others

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:90%
in a similar fashion.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.862 align:middle line:84%
And you're referencing it
as functional medicine.

00:25:39.862 --> 00:25:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Could you just tell
us a little bit

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.030 align:middle line:84%
about what functional
medicine is, so

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that we can get a reference
for where we're headed next

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:90%
in our conversation?

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Sure.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So functional medicine is
really root-cause medicine.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
We're taught in medical school
to use drugs and surgery

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:90%
for treatment of illness.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And that works very well
when you have a heart attack

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:90%
or a car accident or trauma.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.388 align:middle line:84%
If it were me in an
automobile accident,

00:26:01.388 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the first place I want to
go is a conventional ER

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:90%
for treatment, right?

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
However, when we deal with
a more chronic illness,

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:84%
like obesity, diabetes,
heart disease, et cetera,

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
autoimmunity in
particular, we don't

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.197 align:middle line:84%
have great drugs or
surgery to treat those.

00:26:15.197 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So the toolbox that we're
given in conventional medicine

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:90%
is very small.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And my goal has always been
to get a bigger toolbox,

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.968 align:middle line:84%
so that I have more resources
to heal the patients.

00:26:23.968 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
right in the same--

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Absolutely necessary.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.438 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: --line with that.

00:26:27.438 --> 00:26:29.212 align:middle line:84%
So functional medicine
just gave me--

00:26:29.212 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:84%
it's funny, because
I knew I wanted

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.340 align:middle line:84%
to do functional medicine before
I knew what it was called.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It was basically being a
great medical detective

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and finding out what was
the trigger and the causes

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.682 align:middle line:84%
and going backwards and
trying to reverse that.

00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So functional medicine really
gets to the root cause.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And I call myself a
medical detective.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.165 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of how it works.

00:26:46.165 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So different
needs in crisis care

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
than in chronic illness,
different needs.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.200 align:middle line:90%
And so you operate differently.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.410 align:middle line:84%
You function differently in
your office with your patients

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
than if someone was
coming in, rushing in

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:90%
after an automobile accident.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And so in that, what
kind of approach is it?

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Who are your patients?

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
What is happening in
your clinical setting?

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.753 align:middle line:84%
And before I address that,
I want to just mention,

00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:19.152 align:middle line:90%
we talked-- alluded to story.

00:27:19.152 --> 00:27:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I was with the medical system
as integrative director

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:90%
in Illinois.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I moved out here in
2010 to start my own clinic.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that had to happen,

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I had to basically
be an entrepreneur

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and be my own marketer.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.450 align:middle line:10%
And I really remember the time
when I was comfortable enough

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:10%
to put my story online, to
actually put it out there

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:10%
for the public.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually quite an introvert.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.452 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a very private person.

00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:90%
You maybe wouldn't know that.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.467 align:middle line:84%
But part of my growth
has been because--

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I understand.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: --there's no
power in this suffering

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:84%
or this experience
unless it's shared,

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.060 align:middle line:84%
unless I go out there
and be completely

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:84%
authentic with my patients,
with my fans, with the audience.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was a really big
step when I put it out there.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And then as I started
teach physicians,

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I would tell little
bits and little bits.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.342 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, every time
I would look at the audience

00:28:03.342 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and see, and I would see
tears running down their face.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:90%
And I would see the impact.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And to me, there is no
greater purpose in my life

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.475 align:middle line:84%
than to impact and inspire
other people through my story.

00:28:13.475 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I would
see that, it would

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:90%
encourage me to share more.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be I'd share
this "tied up in a bow"

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:84%
picture of breast
cancer I overcame

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and Crohn's, like
we talked about.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And now, I get even
more real about today.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.387 align:middle line:84%
What am I dealing with
and how am I overcoming

00:28:25.387 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:90%
this thing today or this--

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and it could be
emotional, physical.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But the more real and
authentic I can step up there

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:90%
and be, the more impact.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is at the core
the success of everything

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I've done, is being OK
with being so vulnerable

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.950 align:middle line:90%
in a public setting.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Everything.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.408 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I have to tell you,
I travel around the world,

00:28:42.408 --> 00:28:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and I teach other
doctors, and I teach

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.710 align:middle line:84%
the layperson about
these alternative,

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.390 align:middle line:84%
natural health care
means, and I have

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that I come
across so many people that

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.450 align:middle line:84%
are sharing this exact
story that they are shy,

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:90%
they're introverted.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.025 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there's
something that they're

00:28:58.025 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
connecting with in this deep
internalization of themselves

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that is actually what
I find is needed now.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:84%
It's what's creating the
doctor that is effective.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And it is what is creating
the self-healer that

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is effective in our audiences,
in our patient base,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.250 align:middle line:90%
in our clientele.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:84%
What is happening is
people are intimately

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:84%
connecting with
the soulful self,

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:84%
their deep spiritual
being, their essence.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And it is the healer
that is rising up.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:90%
And you've discovered this.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're operating your
clinic, your approach,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:90%
from this exact perspective.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It is a most
beautiful contribution

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
to what I think is required
for humanity to rise up

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:43.110 align:middle line:84%
into being self-empowered,
self-illuminating,

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:90%
and self-healing.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.035 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And we can only
teach what we practice.

00:29:46.035 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:90%
So it starts with us.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:10%
And I'm getting goosebumps
all over my body as you speak,

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.780 align:middle line:10%
because what I was taught
in medical school was,

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.580 align:middle line:10%
use the science.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm an analytical mind.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.650 align:middle line:10%
I love the science.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:10%
I was an engineer background.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:90%
So I love science.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.040 align:middle line:10%
But what I realized, as I
got into my intuitive self,

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.920 align:middle line:10%
the power of taking complex
situations and large amounts

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:10%
of data and analyzing it with
your brain and analytical mind

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:10%
versus your heart and intuition,
the heart and intuition

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:10%
can process thousands, if not
millions of times more data

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:10%
in an instant.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do now is I
have this sense of knowing

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:84%
of where I'm going and what
the problems with my patients

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.455 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I prove
it with science.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So I still love and
use the science.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have a foundation
of great science.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But I start with the
heart and intuitive sense.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's a whole different way.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's way more accurate.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:32.655 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.490 align:middle line:84%
We were trained to
pick things apart.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:middle line:84%
To diagnose, we have
to pick it apart.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.480 align:middle line:84%
To heal, we have
to put it together.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
you're finding.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:90%
This is what you're discovering.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.500 align:middle line:84%
This is what is
happening within you.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And it is a beautiful,
beautiful thing.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So when people come
to you, are you

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:90%
the first doctor they come to?

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Do they just like, [SNAP] oh,
I'm sick, I'm not feeling well,

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to jump right into
my functional medicine doctor

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.117 align:middle line:90%
and come to Dr. Jill?

00:30:59.117 --> 00:31:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Is this the person that you see?

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.396 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: No.

00:31:01.396 --> 00:31:01.892 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:01.892 --> 00:31:03.225 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I was curious about that.

00:31:03.225 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: I joke.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Other doctors have
said this, but I always

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:84%
joke about being the
resort doctor, which

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.083 align:middle line:90%
is the doctor of last resort.

00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Not that you're
working on a resort location.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: No.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: But that you're
the last resort.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They come to you when
nothing else has worked.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So I see people who have been
Cleveland Clinic and Stanford

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.155 align:middle line:84%
University, and they've
been Mayo Clinic, any

00:31:22.155 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:90%
of the major medical centers.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.995 align:middle line:84%
And the problem there
is they've gotten

00:31:24.995 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:84%
an incredible
conventional workup.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.720 align:middle line:84%
But again, the toolbox that the
conventional system is limited.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.747 align:middle line:84%
So they've come up
against that toolbox

00:31:32.747 --> 00:31:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember in medical
school, I was the crazy one,

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.663 align:middle line:84%
because I had this
integrative medical club.

00:31:36.663 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was always getting
massage and acupuncture

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and lecturers to come in and
teach us more new things.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thought
I was a little wacky.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of my colleagues
through medical school,

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.420 align:middle line:84%
whether it's their
son or their husband

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:84%
or their daughter or their
aunt, they have an illness,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:84%
they'll call me and
say, you know, Jill, I

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.538 align:middle line:84%
thought you were a little off,
but now do you have any help

00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:58.080 align:middle line:84%
or do any answers
for me, because I'm

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.840 align:middle line:84%
realizing my education
didn't prepare me for this.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I see it all over the
place, that they're actually

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:84%
realizing the power
now of the more

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.856 align:middle line:84%
functional, integrative,
holistic approach.

00:32:07.856 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So these patients
are going to doctors.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:84%
They're inquiring
about their odds,

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:90%
their chances, their options.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason,
they either try those things

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and it hasn't worked, or they're
afraid to try those things.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they end up coming
to you as a last resort.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it because they just
didn't get the answers that

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.157 align:middle line:90%
were feeling appropriate?

00:32:33.157 --> 00:32:34.490 align:middle line:90%
What is it that they say to you?

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Why do they come to you?

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:84%
What do they say that that
has landed them finally

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:90%
in front of you?

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.117 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious about this,
because I would really

00:32:42.117 --> 00:32:45.003 align:middle line:84%
love for people to
just come straight

00:32:45.003 --> 00:32:47.170 align:middle line:84%
to these kinds of approaches,
where someone is going

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.760 align:middle line:90%
to take ahold of your case--

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and not have it be a case,
but take ahold of your life

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.620 align:middle line:84%
circumstances and
investigate what

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.505 align:middle line:84%
is working for you in this
multidimensional being,

00:32:57.505 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful
creature that you are,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.710 align:middle line:84%
what is not connecting
that's allowing you

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:02.960 align:middle line:90%
to be sick in the first place.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get
people to recognize

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:84%
that they can come straight
to this line of thinking

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and this approach and
perhaps cut to the chase

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.140 align:middle line:90%
a little sooner?

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Well,
there's a select few that

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.060 align:middle line:84%
are more the people
have resources

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and they really are interested
in optimizing performance.

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And I do that as well.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's one area I love.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the small percentage
that are aware enough to say,

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to improve
my performance.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.988 align:middle line:84%
I want improve my gut,
I want improve my brain,

00:33:28.988 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:90%
I want improved my physicality.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to be optimally
performing in every area--

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:84%
spiritually,
mentally, physically.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:90%
How can you help me?

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:90%
And I can absolutely help them.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones we
would love to see more of.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, is this in
a proactive kind of way?

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Or they have an
illness, and they're--

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: No, some--
there's a small percentage.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They're not so sick.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.860 align:middle line:84%
They're just like, hey, I
just want to up-level my--

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.068 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes, performance.

00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --life, my
performance in life.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:49.205 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Exactly.

00:33:49.205 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: My experience.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: So there are a few.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
The rest, which is the
majority, are very, very sick

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
a lot of places.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
You ask about what is the thing
that I give that's different.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I think the inspiration
and hope piece.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.795 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been beaten
down by doctor after doctor

00:34:02.795 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:90%
after doctor.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.740 align:middle line:90%
They've been told they're crazy.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:84%
They've been told, see
a psychiatrist, which

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.257 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, the most
awful thing anyone

00:34:08.257 --> 00:34:10.429 align:middle line:84%
could be told when they're
actually physically ill.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And they come, and they
know, or they read my story,

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:90%
and they have a sense of hope.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: As if to infer that a
psychiatrist approach might not

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:84%
be addressing the fact that
they are tuned into something,

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:20.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.469 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Nothing wrong with
going to a psychiatrist--

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Absolutely.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --if the
psychiatrist is interested

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:90%
in a holistic approach as well.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.418 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Absolutely.

00:34:26.418 --> 00:34:28.742 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: But not to infer,
look, this is all in your head

00:34:28.742 --> 00:34:29.659 align:middle line:90%
and you just need to--

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: That's
what I'm saying.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --you need
to clear that up.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.989 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I completely
see a role for psychiatry.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Just the fact of if there's a
physical illness that someone's

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:84%
denying and telling
them, this doesn't exist,

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:90%
it's all-- you're crazy.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:90%
That's what's not OK with me.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:84%
And you see those patients
who come and they've just--

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I see tears every
day in my office.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:84%
I have people fly
from all over the US

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:51.650 align:middle line:84%
to come see me, because they
sense that there's a hope.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:90%
And there's a sense--

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.889 align:middle line:90%
the truth is I really care.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Every person that comes
in I care about them.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.110 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.388 align:middle line:90%
And that's that nurturer part.

00:35:01.388 --> 00:35:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But now, I have
become healthy enough

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.850 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have a boundary,
so that I don't take it home.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: But while I'm
there with them, and I--

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I understand.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.173 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: --put
everything into that case,

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:90%
and they sense that.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the unspoken thing.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that I
will give them everything

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.840 align:middle line:90%
I have to help them heal.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, absolutely.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly what
is required for healing.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Is to be met.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:22.663 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Just meet me.

00:35:22.663 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Let me know I'm OK.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Let me know I can do this.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And now, let's get busy
with some functional things

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that I can begin to
shift this energetically,

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:84%
to turn the tides in my favor,
instead of allowing my mind

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to lock into this belief there's
nothing you can do, this is

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:84%
never going to
heal, you're going

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:84%
to have multiple surgeries
and be on multiple medications

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.750 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not a very
positive outlook.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.700 align:middle line:90%
So you're shifting that.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:84%
When you dig in,
what are you looking

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:84%
for in a patient's history,
in their medical history?

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.813 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, just let's go there.

00:35:53.813 --> 00:35:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I might have another
question for you after that.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Sure.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So I see a lot of-- you ask
about types of conditions.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of
autoimmunity, obesity,

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:84%
chronic metabolic
types of stuff.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.570 align:middle line:84%
What I do typically is I want to
ask about where were you born.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Were you born vaginally
versus C-section,

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because those things actually
affect the microbiome.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:84%
What were your
parents' illnesses

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and how-- so generationally,
you can see patterns.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'll start-- it might
be an 85-year-old man,

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.740 align:middle line:84%
but I will start with his birth
and was he breast or bottle fed

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and was he vaginal
versus C-section.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And then his family and
his family dynamics,

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:middle line:84%
there's so often a family
dynamic, an alcoholic parent,

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
those things will
affect the health.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You bet.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And so I'm
asking about those things.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And what I start with as I
sit down and they sit there,

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:35.900 align:middle line:90%
I let them relax a minute.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I get them a glass of tea.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, tell me your story.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what I start with,
because everybody has a story.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.722 align:middle line:90%
And most of time, they sigh.

00:36:44.722 --> 00:36:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Some people cry when I say
that, because no one's ever just

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:90%
paused.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't speak.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.675 align:middle line:84%
And I let them tell
me their story.

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I'll ask
questions to clarify.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm there to listen
and to hear them.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.861 align:middle line:84%
And they often, in a physician's
office, have never been heard.

00:36:59.861 --> 00:37:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Once witnessed,
we are changed forever.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.120 align:middle line:84%
If someone holds the space
for us, we start to unfold,

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:90%
we start to blossom.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a beautiful
thing when we actually care,

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:13.148 align:middle line:90%
when it's not just a system--

00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:84%
we have to get him in and get
him out and that kind of thing.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Those days are numbered.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.780 align:middle line:84%
People are not
tolerating that anymore.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.320 align:middle line:90%
And we shouldn't, right.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.385 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Absolutely.

00:37:21.385 --> 00:37:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you
mentioned something

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.360 align:middle line:84%
about asking about
family history

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and the genetic inheritance
in that capacity.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.270 align:middle line:84%
What do you think about
epigenetics and the idea

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:84%
that our beliefs are
contributing to our tendency

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.380 align:middle line:84%
to out-picture in a disease
condition and our ability

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:90%
to shift this.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And this is why--

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.310 align:middle line:84%
This was the other question
I was going to come to.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we are asked, does
your mother have this,

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:84%
did your father have this,
is it locking into the belief

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that if it was in my up-line,
I'm more prone to have this,

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm likely to have this.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that
there is something

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
we can do to start shifting
how we approach the belief

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:84%
system in people that
could be contributing

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to the ultimate
out-picturing of disease?

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes, 100%.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.372 align:middle line:90%
So you mentioned epigenetics.

00:38:12.372 --> 00:38:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is
really the ability--

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So we do all these
gene tests now.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in a black and
white report with this gene you

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:19.788 align:middle line:84%
have, and this gene
you don't have,

00:38:19.788 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and this gene may
cause this disease.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is our
food intake, number one;

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:29.430 align:middle line:84%
our environmental toxic exposure
is number two; our beliefs,

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.850 align:middle line:84%
our ability to be optimistic
or depressed or happy or sad

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:84%
or our mental emotional
states, our connection with God

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:39.330 align:middle line:84%
or higher power, every
single thing and more

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:84%
will influence the
ability of those genes

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
to either express
or not express.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So you may have a gene black
and white on a piece of paper.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.633 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
I believed that I

00:38:48.633 --> 00:38:50.550 align:middle line:84%
was going to be cured
from Crohn's and cancer,

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that belief actually
was part of my healing.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You bet.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.730 align:middle line:90%
I totally get that

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So of those things,
environmental toxins,

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.557 align:middle line:84%
this trilogy that you
were just referencing,

00:39:03.557 --> 00:39:04.640 align:middle line:90%
is there a priority there?

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Is there one that has a
greater influence than others?

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:84%
You speak so highly about
the role of belief and faith

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.360 align:middle line:90%
and the allowance of that.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Does that pri-- outweigh our
external environmental toxins

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:90%
or our nutritional intake?

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Or is there any kind
of prioritization

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.497 align:middle line:90%
in your perception there?

00:39:23.497 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Well,
so I have the belief

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:84%
that we can overcome
anything we believe.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So there is a huge power there.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that I got
cancer to begin with

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:84%
was probably due to the fact, in
part, that I grew up in a farm

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.360 align:middle line:84%
in central Illinois, where some
of the highest use of things

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.330 align:middle line:84%
like atrazine and organic
phosphates and glyphosate

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:90%
were present.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.350 align:middle line:84%
All of those things can
have endocrine and microbial

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:84%
disrupting effects, so that
someone as a young woman

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is more prone to have cells in
her breast that rapidly divide

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:90%
and become cancerous.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So from my perspective, my
poor detoxification genetics,

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:84%
in addition to toxic
exposure, probably as a child,

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.530 align:middle line:84%
maybe in utero, in my mother's
womb, led to these cells--

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.330 align:middle line:84%
probably at five
or six, because it

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:84%
takes a decade or two for those
cancer cells to become cancer.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So if I was 25, I probably
had my first insult

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.560 align:middle line:84%
at five or 10 years
old for the cells

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.870 align:middle line:84%
to start to become--
doing abnormal things.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.343 align:middle line:84%
So those environmental
toxins are huge.

00:40:15.343 --> 00:40:16.260 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned a triad.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to be just real
clear with our audience.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So autoimmune disease-- which is
Crohn's or rheumatoid arthritis

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.640 align:middle line:84%
or multiple sclerosis or
Hashimoto's thyroiditis,

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and many more, lupus--

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:90%
all of these have a commonality.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And as a functional
medicine doctor,

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.588 align:middle line:84%
the thing underlying
this is a triad.

00:40:30.588 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And the number one
thing is genetics.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:32.970 align:middle line:90%
So you can't--

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a gene that predisposes
me for Crohn's disease.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I have another that
predisposes me for cancer.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.570 align:middle line:90%
So that fits with my history.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.040 align:middle line:90%
So you can't change that gene.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:84%
You can change expression
through food and diet

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.560 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But the other two
things you can change

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and the other two things
in the triad are the gut.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So the gut immune
interface happens

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.010 align:middle line:90%
along our intestinal lining.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, if we
have abnormal microbiome,

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.390 align:middle line:84%
meaning the bugs that are
contained inside of our gut,

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.300 align:middle line:84%
they will actually
trigger immune responses

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.643 align:middle line:84%
and cause an abnormal
attack on self.

00:41:02.643 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing is
environmental triggers.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.018 align:middle line:84%
That could be
something like gluten

00:41:06.018 --> 00:41:08.220 align:middle line:84%
as a food source,
could be toxic mold.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It could be
environmental chemicals.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So this triad of genetics, gut,
and environmental exposures,

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:84%
that really underlies
all autoimmune disease.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.443 align:middle line:84%
So I could have an MS patient
or Hashimoto's patient

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:20.610 align:middle line:84%
walk in my office, I'm going
to go to the same route

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and look at those three things.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do you feel
that this diagnosis,

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.325 align:middle line:84%
and then the treatment
that you went through,

00:41:26.325 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and the intensity of all of that
created any kind of quickening

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:33.270 align:middle line:84%
inside of you that
awakened you to a higher

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.780 align:middle line:84%
level of your own empowerment,
that maybe you never would have

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.720 align:middle line:84%
awakened to had you not
been through these sets

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.040 align:middle line:90%
of circumstances?

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Did it serve in that way?

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Absolutely.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:90%
I think every experience--

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I went through divorce,
the breast cancer,

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.600 align:middle line:84%
the Crohn's disease,
mold exposure,

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.330 align:middle line:84%
which caused illness,
on and on and on.

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But every single step of
the way, God has shown me,

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I have more for you.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking you
through these things

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:84%
as training and experience
for the next level.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.470 align:middle line:90%
I continue to see that.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:02.962 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always in
awe, like, God,

00:42:02.962 --> 00:42:04.170 align:middle line:90%
what do you have next for me?

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Because it's going to be big.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I just see the
sense of it's not about me.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.925 align:middle line:84%
It's about how can I love
and serve other people.

00:42:09.925 --> 00:42:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But he continues to take me
through some really difficult

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm his guinea
pig, I always joke.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's Jill
going to do next?

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.793 align:middle line:84%
And he takes me through these
things that are difficult.

00:42:18.793 --> 00:42:21.940 align:middle line:84%
But every time, I get lessons
and I get more empowerment

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.580 align:middle line:84%
of not only my faith, because
I know that he has gotten me

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:90%
through anything.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:26.890 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
that you could tell

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:28.240 align:middle line:84%
me is coming my way that
I would be afraid of.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Like, I got this.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Nothing.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I got it.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Bring it.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Bring it on.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: But don't bring it.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't need it.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't need it to
convince myself.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.505 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: But I
don't have the fear.

00:42:36.505 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that
could come my way that I

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.995 align:middle line:90%
couldn't conquer with God.

00:42:39.995 --> 00:42:40.795 align:middle line:90%
So that's powerful.

00:42:40.795 --> 00:42:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So regarding this triad
that you're speaking about,

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.810 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing is empowering
the overarching consciousness

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.180 align:middle line:84%
of the individual
that has the ability

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:84%
to manage these things
in a different way.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They can be in charge.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:54.910 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to be
at the effect of even

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:58.150 align:middle line:84%
their inheritance
genetically or at the effect

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:00.370 align:middle line:84%
any longer of what
they grew up with.

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:03.100 align:middle line:84%
We have the power to turn
these genes on and off.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.680 align:middle line:84%
We have the power to generate
a different vibrational

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:84%
frequency, one of healing,
in our own systems.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.990 align:middle line:84%
My role of, more than
physician, is teacher.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:90%
I am a teacher.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if I give them
education and they understand,

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:15.460 align:middle line:84%
then they can take
it and roll with it.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:84%
My happiest moment
are when patients

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.415 align:middle line:84%
don't come back to see me
because they're doing so well.

00:43:18.415 --> 00:43:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And then
make room for more.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Unpacking the mystery,
unpacking the mystery.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So more and more, autoimmune
diseases are being diagnosed.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I know that when I opened
my clinic, my practice,

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:34.330 align:middle line:84%
over 30 years ago, this
was a rare statement that

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.770 align:middle line:84%
came across my
desk, that someone

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.770 align:middle line:84%
would come in or have a
diagnosis in this direction

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:90%
of autoimmunity.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel about that?

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you comment on what's
going on in our culture,

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:51.322 align:middle line:84%
that this diagnosis is running
rampant in our society.

00:43:51.322 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I really believe
the elephant in the room

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.357 align:middle line:90%
is the environmental toxic load.

00:43:55.357 --> 00:43:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So the amount of chemicals that
are approved for use in the US

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:84%
every year is astronomical,
in the hundreds of thousands.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And most of these have no
testing on humans, especially

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.337 align:middle line:90%
long term testing.

00:44:04.337 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're dumping
these toxic chemicals

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:84%
into the environment
at astronomical rates.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's exponentially
growing the exposures,

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.888 align:middle line:90%
because it's in our food supply.

00:44:11.888 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It's in our water supply.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.260 align:middle line:90%
It's in our air supply.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.340 align:middle line:84%
80% of environmental
toxic exposure

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.040 align:middle line:84%
is in the air, which
is crazy to me.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.415 align:middle line:84%
Because we think about food
and other things, but the air

00:44:20.415 --> 00:44:21.910 align:middle line:90%
we breathe could be killing us.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a paper recently on
inhalation Alzheimer's, which

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.510 align:middle line:84%
is 30% of the cases in this
study were due to inhaled mold

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.850 align:middle line:84%
or other toxic effects
that caused Alzheimer's.

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So this toxic load-- and
most of these chemicals

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.160 align:middle line:84%
have half lives in
the 50 or more years.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So they're accumulating
at rapid, rapid rates.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:40.660 align:middle line:90%
And so that load--

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.120 align:middle line:84%
our bodies are designed
to heal and overcome.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is this load
will weigh down the system

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and make it very difficult and
sluggish to be able to heal.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We've lost touch
with making smart decisions

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:90%
for our environment.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.900 align:middle line:84%
We've lost touch with
nature and the fact

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that we are at one
with our environment,

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.335 align:middle line:84%
to even allow the
inventions of such things

00:45:00.335 --> 00:45:02.470 align:middle line:84%
that create such
toxicity for ourselves.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.830 align:middle line:84%
We're inventing ourselves
right out of our own wholeness.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:08.290 align:middle line:90%
It's so amazingly ironic.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.930 align:middle line:84%
It's such a
non-nurturing principle.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of
nurturing and the fact

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:16.630 align:middle line:84%
that you ended up with
these nurturing type disease

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:21.400 align:middle line:84%
conditions, what can you say
about autoimmune and women

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.270 align:middle line:90%
in the diagnosis?

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Are more women being diagnosed
with autoimmune conditions,

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.360 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, than men?

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.990 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I love talking
about this, because not

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.530 align:middle line:90%
many physicians are even aware.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Number one, testosterone
has a huge impact

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:37.310 align:middle line:84%
on calming some of the
autoimmune reactivity.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, men have more
testosterone than women.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.245 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons we see it

00:45:41.245 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:84%
at much larger
proportions in women.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.540 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we see, you
mentioned the metaphorical,

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.210 align:middle line:84%
like the nurturing
with breast cancer,

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:52.113 align:middle line:84%
with autoimmune disease, the
core issue is attack of self.

00:45:52.113 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And I have found in my
own journey and journey

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.480 align:middle line:84%
of patients, there's usually
unexpressed sadness, grief,

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:90%
or anger.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You bet.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: And I've gone
through my own journey of this.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And even recently,
I really opened up

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:07.020 align:middle line:84%
to actually expressing
and feeling some grief

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.180 align:middle line:90%
that I completely--

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.910 align:middle line:84%
My story was I have been very
driven, very productive, very

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.240 align:middle line:90%
successful.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And part of that
came at the cost

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.920 align:middle line:84%
of numbing myself to pain
and suffering and anger.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I would've told you--

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Outrun it.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Outperform it.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.295 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN:
Outperform it, right?

00:46:21.295 --> 00:46:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And so very recently,
I have actually

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:middle line:84%
allowed myself to feel
some of these old things.

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.670 align:middle line:90%
And it was painful.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But as I came out, I was a much
softer, more balanced version

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:30.600 align:middle line:90%
of myself.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know that part of that is
healing the autoimmune disease.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Because that self-directed
anger is really at the core.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You bet.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Our culture has created so
much of this-- externalization

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.440 align:middle line:84%
of power, what do people think,
how do I look, how is my body,

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.790 align:middle line:90%
do I fit in, am I enough.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.210 align:middle line:84%
This constant comparison on
every level of our lives.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And it translates energetically
into, I'm not enough.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:53.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't compare.

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't measure up.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And that translates to
the body has no choice

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.310 align:middle line:84%
but to respond to
what we're constantly

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.750 align:middle line:90%
creating as our environment.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it starts trying to
attack what we don't love.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.510 align:middle line:90%
So we're onto this.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to be fully
embracing of ourselves

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.840 align:middle line:84%
as an individual, as an
individual expression

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:84%
of this god source energy, as
you're speaking about today,

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.840 align:middle line:90%
and allow it to be enough.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.970 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, it's
exhausting to us.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to fatigue
regarding all of this

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and what you see in your
functional medicine practice?

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So fatigue is
really a cellular process that

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.190 align:middle line:90%
happens with the mitochondria.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And so many things--
toxic chemicals, mold,

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.860 align:middle line:84%
endocrine disruption, or
endocrine dysfunction,

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.890 align:middle line:84%
adrenals, thyroid, female
and male hormones--

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:44.430 align:middle line:84%
all of these things can--
and viruses and infections.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.650 align:middle line:84%
At the core of my functional
medicine practice,

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:middle line:84%
most of the time in
complex illnesses

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.160 align:middle line:84%
there's one of two
things happening,

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.600 align:middle line:90%
and both cause fatigue--

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.737 align:middle line:84%
infectious load, like
we talked about, or--

00:47:54.737 --> 00:47:56.820 align:middle line:84%
sorry, infection load,
which we didn't talk about;

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.560 align:middle line:84%
or toxic load, which
we did talk about.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.150 align:middle line:84%
The toxins and
infections tend to be

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.310 align:middle line:84%
at the core of a lot
of these fatigue cases,

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:05.460 align:middle line:84%
even when there's disruption
of the HPA axis or adrenals

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.550 align:middle line:84%
or thyroid or any of the organs
that produce energy for us.

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what makes
our adrenals just

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.150 align:middle line:90%
grind all the time?

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:13.060 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Stress.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.380 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So stress
gets a bad name.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.270 align:middle line:84%
There's eustress, and
we all need some stress

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:19.650 align:middle line:90%
to perform optimally.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So I know I won't
be at my best if I

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.692 align:middle line:84%
don't have a deadline, and an
idea of what's going to happen,

00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a stage
with a big audience.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Those things are
actually stressful,

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.190 align:middle line:84%
but they're good stress, because
they help me perform optimally.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:30.065 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Creative edge.

00:48:30.065 --> 00:48:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Correct, correct.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But when we put ourself
under-- especially

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.752 align:middle line:84%
like I was telling
you years ago when

00:48:34.752 --> 00:48:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I would suppress grief or
sadness and just go, go, go,

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:38.910 align:middle line:90%
had to be super productive.

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And often-- again, I'll
just speak for myself--

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.960 align:middle line:90%
we tie performance with love.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So I learned very early,
if I got straight As

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and I did good in school, my
parents would be really happy

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.557 align:middle line:90%
and show me love.

00:48:49.557 --> 00:48:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Earn my connection.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Earn my connection.

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So I am, again, a
recovering perfectionist

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.190 align:middle line:84%
in that sense of I felt
for many, many years

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that I was loved due to
what I did for people

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.630 align:middle line:90%
or how I performed.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And coming away from that-- it's
an addiction like any other--

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.855 align:middle line:84%
coming away from that
addiction to performance

00:49:05.855 --> 00:49:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and actually
allowing myself just

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to be still, where there's
no productive endpoint,

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.840 align:middle line:84%
be still hiking in the
mountains in Boulder

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying nature,
that actually

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.740 align:middle line:84%
nourishes my soul more than
getting another deadline

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.540 align:middle line:90%
finished.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.665 align:middle line:84%
Like, coming to that point
and realize that there's

00:49:20.665 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:90%
value with stillness--

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, absolutely.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: --is important.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.422 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And to be
still on the inside.

00:49:25.422 --> 00:49:27.800 align:middle line:84%
I run down airport
concourses every week

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.540 align:middle line:84%
because I'm always traveling
and teaching and holding

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.380 align:middle line:90%
workshops myself.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And so life is pushing me to
get out there and do this thing.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But I insist on being still
on the inside when I'm

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.400 align:middle line:90%
in full stride on the outside.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And it translates as allowing
my adrenals to get a signal,

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:46.360 align:middle line:90%
all is well.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.190 align:middle line:84%
We might be full
stride, but all is well.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: All is well.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to be
deliberate about that,

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:53.590 align:middle line:84%
or the world will push
us, push us, push us.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:56.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we are not deliberately
standing our ground

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and knowing who we are,
what our purpose is,

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:00.843 align:middle line:84%
and coming at it with that
sense of peace and stillness,

00:50:00.843 --> 00:50:02.010 align:middle line:90%
the world will push us over.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And allowing ourselves
to feel it on the inside.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I find this is one
of the missing links,

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.950 align:middle line:84%
is that we live in
our heads, and we

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:11.100 align:middle line:84%
don't allow ourselves to
feel this deep connection

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:90%
that we are divinely guided.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:17.950 align:middle line:84%
We are here as the expression
of that universal consciousness.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:18.840 align:middle line:90%
We are cosmic beings.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.130 align:middle line:90%
We are made of everything.

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Nothing missing, nothing
broken, nothing wrong.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.460 align:middle line:10%
So as we begin to
live in this way,

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.500 align:middle line:10%
we start to overcome
things like fatigue

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.410 align:middle line:10%
and this disorientation
that so often is

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:33.390 align:middle line:10%
referenced as brain fog.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to the
relationship between fatigue,

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.810 align:middle line:84%
brain fog, these
senses of disconnection

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that people are feeling
and lack of vital force?

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So again, I
see the physicality of it

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is that toxic load, infections
bring all these things,

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:47.880 align:middle line:90%
weighing them down.

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.505 align:middle line:84%
But even, like you
said, if they're not

00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:53.000 align:middle line:84%
connected with source or self
or a purpose in life-- purpose

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.910 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most commonly
missed things that people don't

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.730 align:middle line:84%
have, that are floundering
with health or with life

00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:59.930 align:middle line:90%
or with decisions.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they find that source
of purpose and centeredness,

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.730 align:middle line:84%
that will end up
driving everything,

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.570 align:middle line:90%
even the will to overcome.

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:07.800 align:middle line:90%
I think the brain fog comes--

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.097 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the brain is
an organ like any other.

00:51:10.097 --> 00:51:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you're getting affected
by the cells with fatigue,

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.100 align:middle line:90%
your brain is affected.

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:17.353 align:middle line:84%
Especially with toxins like
mold or other toxic exposures,

00:51:17.353 --> 00:51:18.770 align:middle line:84%
the brain tends
to be very largely

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:90%
affected by those things.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But the source, the answer
to it is still the same.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It's getting grounded,
getting healing,

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.030 align:middle line:84%
choosing to detoxify
your environment,

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and being still, like you
mentioned in the airport.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this relationship
between fatigue and toxicity,

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.660 align:middle line:90%
very strongly interwoven.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You've had your
own experience with this.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you just say a
little bit about that

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.680 align:middle line:90%
to land it for everybody?

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.888 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Sure, you got it.

00:51:42.888 --> 00:51:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So I was going along great,
Crohn's and cancer in my past.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:48.830 align:middle line:84%
I started to practice in
Boulder and moved offices once.

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And in 2013, there was a
massive flood in Boulder.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And unbeknownst to me, my office
building had been flooded.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And right below my office was
a large amount of Stachybotrys,

00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:58.850 align:middle line:90%
which is a very toxic--

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:02.550 align:middle line:84%
The toxin from the trichothecene
is used in chemical warfare.

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:06.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a known neurotoxin,
immunotoxin, just awful.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.548 align:middle line:84%
And I started becoming fatigued,
brain fog, skin rashes,

00:52:09.548 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:84%
couldn't walk upstairs without
getting short of breath.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.975 align:middle line:90%
My lungs were affected.

00:52:12.975 --> 00:52:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So I knew there was
something going on there.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.267 align:middle line:84%
And that began my journey
really to learn about toxic mold

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and heal people
from that as well.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So was this a mystery
in your world at this point?

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And how did you go
about leaning into the mystery

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and unpacking it?

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: The funny thing
was I was so in denial,

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:28.900 align:middle line:90%
because usually--

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have a compassion
for my patients,

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.455 align:middle line:84%
because when you
have a mold issue,

00:52:32.455 --> 00:52:33.830 align:middle line:84%
it's your home or
your workplace,

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.470 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of your safe
place is not safe.

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very deep
physiological trigger

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:41.180 align:middle line:84%
with patients who've had mold
exposure, including myself,

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.930 align:middle line:84%
which I feel like I've
overcome with this.

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It's PTSD, because you get
this attack of something

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.710 align:middle line:90%
you don't know.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:46.510 align:middle line:90%
It's foreign.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And it actually affects
physiology profoundly,

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.775 align:middle line:84%
causes very, very,
very intense illness.

00:52:51.775 --> 00:52:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And to come out
of that, you have

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:54.275 align:middle line:90%
to get out of the exposure.

00:52:54.275 --> 00:52:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have to leave home,
things, workplace behind,

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.375 align:middle line:84%
start over, and
then heal yourself.

00:52:59.375 --> 00:53:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And it's elusive.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You don't think
of that that's what's

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.980 align:middle line:90%
causing me to feel this way.

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.360 align:middle line:90%
You don't connect the dots.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So what were your symptoms
that were initiating for you?

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.470 align:middle line:90%
What unfolded there?

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, respiratory
tract is almost always

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.405 align:middle line:84%
affected, because
we're breathing

00:53:12.405 --> 00:53:15.270 align:middle line:84%
in those VOCs, volatile
organic solvents from mold.

00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:16.490 align:middle line:90%
So I had shortness of breath.

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:17.782 align:middle line:90%
I had a little bit of wheezing.

00:53:17.782 --> 00:53:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I've never had
asthma in my life.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But at 40 years old when I got
the exposure-- or actually 38,

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:25.610 align:middle line:84%
but it started causing wheezing
and issues with asthma.

00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Brain fog was a big one.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And then skin rashes,
mucous membranes

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.500 align:middle line:90%
are red and irritated.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.770 align:middle line:90%
The gut can be affected.

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can have pain,
heartburn, gas and bloating.

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Infections, because your immune
system is kind of crashed,

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.100 align:middle line:90%
so you get frequent infections.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Numbness, tingling,
neuropathies,

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:44.740 align:middle line:84%
almost every system
can be affected.

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So all of these
subtle irritants playing out

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.290 align:middle line:84%
for a long time is
exhausting the system.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.487 align:middle line:84%
Your own immunity
becomes depleted.

00:53:53.487 --> 00:53:54.320 align:middle line:90%
We're unaware of it.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.560 align:middle line:90%
It's subliminal as an irritant.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet ultimately,
it starts to surface

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:03.810 align:middle line:84%
as this confluence of symptoms
that are making you sick,

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:06.047 align:middle line:84%
making you
dysfunctional, et cetera.

00:54:06.047 --> 00:54:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: It's a
mystery of all mysteries.

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've experienced
that, I see it all the time.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always shocked at
how many people are affected.

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they might have
an autoimmune disease,

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.710 align:middle line:84%
mold can trigger
autoimmunity, they

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.050 align:middle line:84%
might have brain fog or
early onset dementia.

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.685 align:middle line:84%
They might have new onset
asthma or allergies.

00:54:20.685 --> 00:54:21.810 align:middle line:90%
So they come to the doctor.

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They might have gut issues,
like bacterial overgrowth

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:24.860 align:middle line:90%
in their bowel.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So they come to the doctor
with one of these organ system

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.360 align:middle line:84%
problems, and the
doctor often doesn't

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.030 align:middle line:84%
know that there's a bigger
issue, and it's the mold.

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you were going
through this yourself.

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.127 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this isn't
something you read about,

00:54:37.127 --> 00:54:40.310 align:middle line:84%
cases that you're gathering
information on in hopes

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.640 align:middle line:90%
to share it with someone else.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.440 align:middle line:90%
You've been there.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yes.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You get it.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So at some point, you
discovered, oh my gosh,

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:49.310 align:middle line:84%
it's my very safe space that's
actually making me sick.

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And then what did you do
to detoxify your body?

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.420 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So it was 2014,
the day after Christmas,

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I found the report from the
mold from the bulk sample.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.535 align:middle line:84%
I saw Stachybotrys, and
it matched the urine test

00:55:01.535 --> 00:55:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that I had done on my
body showing the toxin.

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:04.210 align:middle line:90%
So it matched.

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:06.140 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, this is an issue.

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.880 align:middle line:84%
From that day, that
was 2014, I never

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.070 align:middle line:90%
stepped foot back in my office.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I had 20 years of
medical school books--

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:15.140 align:middle line:84%
you know how that goes-- my
library, and I love books.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I always joke, before
I was a physician,

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I always thought I was
going to be a librarian.

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:19.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.624 align:middle line:90%
I got plenty.

00:55:20.624 --> 00:55:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Thank
goodness, I wouldn't have

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.985 align:middle line:90%
gotten much impact in that.

00:55:22.985 --> 00:55:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe, but got
a different plan.

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:27.668 align:middle line:84%
But I love my books,
is my point here.

00:55:27.668 --> 00:55:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, I understand.

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Precious.

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So I
got rid of them all.

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:33.933 align:middle line:84%
And everything in the office,
I left and walked away.

00:55:33.933 --> 00:55:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And I started in like
a temporary office

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.690 align:middle line:84%
space for a few months, and then
eventually got my own office,

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:39.980 align:middle line:90%
a new office that was clean.

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:40.940 align:middle line:90%
But it was quite an ordeal.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:43.220 align:middle line:84%
For two months, I worked from
home doing phone consults,

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:43.970 align:middle line:90%
because that's all I had.

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:45.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have an office.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And I was pretty sick.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.920 align:middle line:90%
I just got by.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But it was a
devastating experience,

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.965 align:middle line:90%
because I lost everything.

00:55:51.965 --> 00:55:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Not just your
books, but all of your--

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, everything
in my office was gone.

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Tough.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Yeah, it was--

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We have to make a
decision, though, right?

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: You do,
and that's what--

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.570 align:middle line:84%
patients, every
day in my office,

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.130 align:middle line:84%
they talk to them
about, there's probably

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:05.610 align:middle line:84%
a mold issue in your house,
what are you going to do?

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody has
to leave everything.

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:08.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's the good news.

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But some of them have
to make hard decisions.

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're always-- if they're
attached to their material

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:14.350 align:middle line:90%
things--

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.460 align:middle line:84%
For me, the biggest
lesson there was health

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.290 align:middle line:90%
is the thing that matters most.

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:20.760 align:middle line:84%
All these material
things can be replaced,

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.960 align:middle line:90%
but your health can't.

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I chose.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.782 align:middle line:84%
And I always encourage
patients to do the same,

00:56:24.782 --> 00:56:26.990 align:middle line:84%
to choose your health,
because you can replace books.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.830 align:middle line:90%
You can place furniture.

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:28.520 align:middle line:90%
You can place all--

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Stuff.

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: Stuff.

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Actually letting go
of our attachments

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:34.640 align:middle line:84%
in every level of our
lives is a wonderful way

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to begin a healing
process, because--

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: And it did.

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --when we were

00:56:59.765 --> 00:57:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, you mentioned
growing up on a farm

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and possibly being
exposed to toxins there.

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there a relationship here
between this constant surfacing

of this sensitivity?

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:15.140 align:middle line:84%
What can you say to people
that have possibly also

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.240 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to toxins
throughout the course

00:57:23.277 --> 00:57:24.110 align:middle line:90%
but to transcend it?

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNAHAN: I love that.

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I really believe
there was much toxic chemical,

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:30.260 align:middle line:84%
probably our well
water and everything

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:32.360 align:middle line:84%
in between, that
I was exposed to.

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.717 align:middle line:84%
And I was born with genetics
that don't detoxify well.

00:57:35.717 --> 00:57:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Again, I've overcome that.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But that made for a perfect
storm for young illness,

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:40.430 align:middle line:90%
as I experienced.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And my sister at 27
had thyroid cancer.

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's two girls,
25, 27, cancer.

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That tells you something
about the environment, right?

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Genetics plus environment.

I'd much rather teach patients

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.980 align:middle line:84%
daily habits to
detoxify, because we're

00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.960 align:middle line:84%
in such a toxic world,
I say we're swimming

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.720 align:middle line:90%
in toxic soup every day.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.810 align:middle line:90%
It's swimming around us.

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:03.710 align:middle line:90%
We're in it.

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:04.920 align:middle line:90%
We can't get out of it.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have to daily be
deliberate on the choices we

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.720 align:middle line:84%
make in the ways we detoxify
in order to get out ahead.

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.880 align:middle line:84%
That could mean Epsom
salt baths at night.

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It could mean drinking alkaline
or mineral water between meals.

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:20.250 align:middle line:84%
It could mean doing infrared
sauna three sessions per week.

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:22.170 align:middle line:84%
It could mean getting
out hiking and sweating.

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:22.970 align:middle line:90%
It could mean--

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Food is a big thing.

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:25.160 align:middle line:84%
People don't even
think about that.

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.827 align:middle line:84%
But whatever we're
putting into our body

00:58:26.827 --> 00:58:28.050 align:middle line:90%
is part of the toxic load.

00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So just choosing organic
when possible is a great way

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:31.410 align:middle line:90%
to start.

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Hm.

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And in this toxic environment
that everyone is swimming in,

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.768 align:middle line:90%
do you feel that--

00:58:38.768 --> 00:58:40.310 align:middle line:84%
well, actually, let
me just say this.

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:44.270 align:middle line:84%
How do you recommend
people recognize

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:48.884 align:middle line:84%
that they're
surrounded by toxicness

00:58:48.884 --> 00:58:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and they might not even know it.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:54.170 align:middle line:84%
How do you recommend that they
begin their own investigation?

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So I can do tests in
the office if they want proof.

00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And we can show in their urine
or in their blood the levels.

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Recently, out of Canada,
there was a cord blood study

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.640 align:middle line:90%
of babies born.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.160 align:middle line:84%
First day of life, they
took the cord blood,

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.010 align:middle line:84%
200 chemicals measured
in the cord blood

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:11.697 align:middle line:90%
from the first day of life.

00:59:11.697 --> 00:59:13.280 align:middle line:84%
To me, that just
shows you we're being

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.170 align:middle line:84%
born into this world
loaded with toxins.

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:16.970 align:middle line:90%
So we are--

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the foods
that our mother

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.430 align:middle line:84%
was eating, through
the environment,

00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:21.500 align:middle line:84%
through the womb,
all of it is here.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.267 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: So we
are born into it.

00:59:23.267 --> 00:59:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I understand what you're saying,
because there are some people

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:27.320 align:middle line:84%
who don't-- you
don't always feel it.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.820 align:middle line:10%
And if you're
resilient and healthy,

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.130 align:middle line:10%
you can get a lot of load
and not really notice it.

00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:33.890 align:middle line:10%
I think the testing
I do will often

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.150 align:middle line:10%
help them see, because
they can see the values.

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But if they're dealing
with an illness,

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.750 align:middle line:84%
then I can explain
the connection

00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:40.330 align:middle line:84%
between their illness
and that load.

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.305 align:middle line:84%
And that is usually
pretty profound.

00:59:42.305 --> 00:59:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So everything is energy.

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:45.320 align:middle line:90%
We are energy.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Our consciousness is energy.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:48.920 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability,
through free will,

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.042 align:middle line:84%
to change the vibrational
frequency of our experience.

00:59:52.042 --> 00:59:53.750 align:middle line:84%
We can decide what
something means to us.

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:56.720 align:middle line:84%
We can decide, as
you have witnessed,

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.730 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
because of my diagnosis,

00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:00.470 align:middle line:84%
or because of my
circumstances, or even

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.035 align:middle line:84%
because of a toxic
environment that I'm in.

01:00:03.035 --> 01:00:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And so do you feel that it
is about the environment

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.900 align:middle line:84%
or it is about our free
will choice that determines

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.510 align:middle line:90%
our healing capacity?

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:16.655 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
what's the bottom line?

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNAHAN: I think, it
ultimately comes down

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:19.670 align:middle line:90%
to the will.

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, I should
be dead, I'm a miracle.

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:23.690 align:middle line:90%
You've heard my story now.

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
