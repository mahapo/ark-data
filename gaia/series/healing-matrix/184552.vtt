00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. SUE MORTER:
Dr. Shamini Jain

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:10%
belongs to a new
generation of scientists

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:10%
who are turning their
focus from curing disease

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:10%
to healing the whole body.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Shamini is a
psychologist, scientist,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and social entrepreneur,
and her work

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:84%
has been featured in TIME,
US News and World Report,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.670 align:middle line:90%
and on CNN.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Currently she is the president
and CEO of the Consciousness

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:90%
and Healing Initiative.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Shamini.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that
you're here with us.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAMINI JAIN: Thank you, Sue.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Can you just give us a--

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I know that a deep
tradition of such

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult to encapsulate
in a sentence or two.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But just to allow our viewers
to have a solid understanding

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
of what Jainism is
and how it differs

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
from other forms of spiritual
study, Hinduism or Buddhism,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.473 align:middle line:90%
I would be happy to.

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:19.573 align:middle line:84%
So Jainism is a
very small religion.

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
People don't really
convert to it.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:10%
It's not a proselytizing
type of religion.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:10%
Some would even call it more
of a philosophy than a religion

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:10%
because it doesn't really hold--

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:10%
it's not really meant
to worship creator gods,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:10%
although there is
an acknowledgment

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:10%
that heavenly beings exist.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
pray to them.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
We really pray for
spiritual liberation,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and that is the liberation
of the soul in its entirety,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
to experience what we might
call god consciousness.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's similar in
some ways to Vedanta,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to the Upanishadic
teachings, to Buddhism.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of the hallmarks for
Jainism that it's known for

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:10%
is its strong principle
in nonviolence

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:10%
as a path toward liberation.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:10%
So much also like
Vedanta and Buddhism,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:10%
we talk about the patterns
of attachment, avoidance,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:10%
and ignorance as ways that we
cloud our soul literally with

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:10%
karma-- and Jains very
much believe in karma--

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.678 align:middle line:10%
that we cloud our soul by
engaging in attachment,

00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:10%
avoidance, and ignorance.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But the practice of nonviolence
helps us to really clear

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:90%
those patterns from our soul.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
We also believe in principles
like [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
which could really be
translated into the principle

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of sufficiency really,
and [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
which is non-absolutism,
the truth of no truth,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:84%
the truth of no absolute truth,
the truth that all spiritual

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
practices lead to
the same place.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And so your truth is
as valid as my truth.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, we parlay that
into psychoneuroimmunology.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Can you say just a
little bit about that

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
so that everyone's on the
same page as we dive in today?

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Imagine that 40
years ago in medicine

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
if you said the emotions
affect the body,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
you would have been
completely laughed at.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, if
you said the brain is

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
connected to the immune system,
you would have been laughed at.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And people were.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.865 align:middle line:90%
So when the people--

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I was one
of those people.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
My father was one
of those people.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%
So I get it.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Yeah, so you know
it really well, right?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
the practitioners

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that were saying this from a
very deep level of experience

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.463 align:middle line:90%
and work with patients.

00:03:30.463 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there were scientists
that were saying this

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
because they were
discovering these connections

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:84%
in their work, and when
they would present that data

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to their colleagues, they were
just completely laughed at.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So they had to really seek
out collaborations and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
transdisciplinary
dialogues with people.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, you had
people in neuroscience

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that were starting to talk
with people in immunology.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:84%
You had doctors talking
with microbiologists

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that
there was a there there,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
but they hadn't
mapped it out yet.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.095 align:middle line:84%
So they began
doing this mapping,

00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
where it began.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:90%
And now look where we are.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.238 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are lymphatic
microvessels in the brain.

00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And we wouldn't have even
thought to look there, right?

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all about world view.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:84%
So the psychoneuroimmunology
is bringing

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
us to understand the
deep interconnections

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
between the mind and the
body, and we're really

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:90%
just beginning.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, we
haven't even begun

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
to uncover the role of
spirit in the process.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And really, psyche
is spirit, right?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So the truth of the
matter is, in the world

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that we live in in science
and medicine, which

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
is fraught by an
overabundance of materialism,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
these haven't been
safe questions to ask.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Are there specific
things that you

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
could say are the components
that psychoneuroimmunology

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
is focusing on just so
that our viewers can

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:90%
land this in the mind?

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Sure.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of study looking
at the role of emotions

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:90%
in health.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, because
of the just sort

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
of the zeitgeist of the way
things were, in the early days

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.887 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of focus
on negative emotions

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and their role in
disease progression.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
still a lot of that

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
role, for example,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:84%
of depression and heart disease
or cancer progression, stress,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:90%
all of that.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But what's also exciting
is in the past decade

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
or so there's a lot of research
into the facets of well-being

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and its relationship
to health so.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And those like studies that
track people over time and see,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
are those that have more
optimism or more purpose

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.583 align:middle line:90%
more likely to live longer?

00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:90%
There are studies like that.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.018 align:middle line:84%
And then there are kind of
more controlled studies,

00:05:34.018 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
if you want to say
it that way, where

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
they look at the effects
of fostering happiness

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.082 align:middle line:84%
in someone and the effects on
things like the common cold.

00:05:42.082 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's really neat
because they're

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
starting to really deeply look
into how our state of being

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
affects the fluctuations,
the dynamic fluctuations

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Inside our system-- so
our immune system is related

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to our emotional system, is
related to our consciousness,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and when they are
tied together, it

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
can generate a sense of
presence and well-being

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately allows an
individual to actually function

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
on this earth the way they
were designed to function.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah?

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Go figure.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely great.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.228 align:middle line:84%
And when we bridge
psychoneuroimmunology tools

00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:84%
with the study of
what's often called

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
integrative medicine
or holistic medicine,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
that's when we really
start to get deeper

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
into exploring what is the
role of presence and spirit

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:90%
right into the process.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Was there an aha
moment in your world,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
in your practice, in
working in your efforts

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
with people that turned
some lights on for you?

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, I mean, several.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.218 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say the first
one really that turned me

00:06:41.218 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
into I'd say a devout seeker of
understanding energy medicine

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and its power in
fostering healing

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
was my own first experience
as a client where

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I just hopped on a table and
experienced a Reiki session.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.725 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
was going to happen.

00:06:57.725 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd always had a
really deep connection

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.717 align:middle line:84%
with sound and vibration
because I grew up singing.

00:07:01.717 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I've always loved to sing.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a singer.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So I knew about
the power of that,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.133 align:middle line:84%
and I explored the
power of mantra.

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But I just couldn't
wrap my head around,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
how could I study
this in a deep way

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.057 align:middle line:84%
beyond just brain changes,
which was cool, but not

00:07:13.057 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:90%
really what I was seeking.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I was seeking to understand
the nature of vibration.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
on that Reiki table,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden I was
feeling all this energy

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:90%
going through my body.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And I could notice
where the knots were

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and how those knots were
connected to old belief systems

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and thought patterns
and emotions that I had

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and what needed to be released.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
the moment where I

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:84%
had a conscious decision
in myself to say,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.567 align:middle line:84%
I'm letting go of this,
and the energy just flowed.

00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It just went.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.275 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: It just went.

00:07:43.275 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- of
course, my scientific mind

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.472 align:middle line:90%
was like, this is really neat.

00:07:47.472 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: How'd I do that?

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: I mean,
I just felt this.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was
completely palpable.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.487 align:middle line:90%
I've never felt like this.

00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's such a
profound connection

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
here with the emotions
and the belief systems.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.585 align:middle line:90%
This has to be studiable.

00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's really where the light
went on in my mind and I said,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:84%
we've got to study this
on a scientific level.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:90%
It could help so many people.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And is it influencing
your profession overall?

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, I would say so.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I really do incorporate subtle
energy awareness in pretty much

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:84%
all the teaching that I do, and
our collection of scientists,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
who have had their own personal
experiences-- are also,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
of course, deep
spiritual practitioners--

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.420 align:middle line:84%
use that information as
well as the great privilege

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
that they've had to study
science to ask the deeper

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:90%
questions now about healing.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's so fascinating
because the power of the mind,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
just letting go of
something, is what

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
allows this true
subtle energy or spirit

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:84%
energy, invisible energy,
the real us, to flow.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.222 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We realize that
the mind is very powerful,

00:08:48.222 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
but we think we're supposed
to think our way into healing

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and wholeness.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
But we can't because the
mind won't let that happen.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not made of wholeness.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:90%
It's only a part of us.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
working with is--

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and sharing from an
experiential level

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:84%
for yourself is that the
greatest power your mind had

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:90%
in that moment was to let go.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Every
time, time and time

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
again-- every
transformative experience

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that I have personally had
or that my clients have had

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
has been when the mind is
put in its rightful place

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:84%
as the observer as
opposed to the driver.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: A steward.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: A steward.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It has to be serving
something bigger than itself.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.247 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: That's right,
the steward of the soul.

00:09:24.247 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is all,
of course, laid out

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:84%
so well in the
ancient scriptures

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
where they say the mind is
like a lame rider and the vital

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:90%
is a blind horse.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:90%
You must unite them together.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the practice of
yoga or union, right?

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, yes.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.487 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: To unite these
together properly

00:09:38.487 --> 00:09:42.733 align:middle line:84%
so that we can serve in a
greater capacity to spirit.

00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What an amazing time that
we're alive that we get to even

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.035 align:middle line:90%
have this conversation, right?

00:09:47.035 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: It's amazing, yeah.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.327 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's such a blessing.

00:09:49.327 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
all of our viewers

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:84%
are watching because
they know it too,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and they know that it's time to
put the pieces back together.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
quite how sometimes

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't
raised in a culture that

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:90%
was nurturing this.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm so grateful
for you bringing

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.330 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of your perspective
to this conversation.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
It's really fabulous.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Thank you.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So speak to us
about the distinction

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:90%
between healing and curing.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.042 align:middle line:90%
I'm on this with you.

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to hear what
you have to say about this.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Thank you.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I have learned
everything about healing

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.272 align:middle line:84%
from talking with letters,
and we're engaged in a process

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:84%
right now at the Consciousness
and Healing Initiative

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.855 align:middle line:84%
where we're reaching out to
a number of different healers

00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and asking them, what is
healing from your perspective?

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And the common
thread-- as you know,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
different beautiful paths

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:90%
towards healing.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:90%
There's protocols.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.403 align:middle line:90%
Some people use protocols.

00:10:41.403 --> 00:10:43.355 align:middle line:84%
Some see the body
as a unified field.

00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Others see it as
a layered field.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.720 align:middle line:84%
There's so many ways for us to
experience what we call energy.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But the common thread that I
have heard time and time again

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:84%
from healers is
that healing is not

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:90%
about getting rid of anything.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not about getting
rid of a disease.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not about seeing
something that's outside of me

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and targeting it
and blowing it up,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:84%
which is almost the way that
medicine has kind of been

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:90%
describing things for so long.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a very
incomplete model, even

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:90%
within medicine.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Very separative.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Separative-- and it just
doesn't work, quite frankly.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the more that we
learn about the connections

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
with the brain and the
gut and everything,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:90%
it's not about that.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's a waste of our time.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's
incomplete at best, right?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fallacy at worst.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: So what healers
say is happening is really

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:90%
a realignment--

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
again, a realignment with the
deepest parts of who we are,

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
a realignment with soul,
with spirit, with god

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, with purpose.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And so their job is
to essentially help

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:84%
clear the debris that
keeps us from being

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:84%
in that place of union
with our soul and spirit.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And so in the process
of doing that,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:84%
the vital life force,
as you mentioned,

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is uncovered because
we're clearing away

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:84%
what some people would
say are karmic patterns.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Others would describe
it differently.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But in that clearing
away of sanskaras,

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
of belief systems,
all of these things,

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
we're able to reconnect the
mind with the vital force

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and foster the healing
that is our birthright.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You speak about
some scars and karma

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and an unresolvedness, a
sense of unresolvedness.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like for you
to just explain karma

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:84%
as you're defining it-- again,
just so that everyone can be

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
following along here together.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.460 align:middle line:84%
The most simple way
to think about karma

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
is really our thoughts,
words, and deeds, our habits.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Jain
tradition, karma

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:90%
is considered a real thing.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.013 align:middle line:90%
It's a non-subtle matter.

00:12:38.013 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that
it's described that way,

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:90%
but that's how it's described.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a very subtle
matter, actually,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:90%
that encases the soul.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.522 align:middle line:84%
And so in Jainism and
in many different--

00:12:48.522 --> 00:12:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Vedantic and other
traditions, they

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.470 align:middle line:84%
describe the different
subtle bodies.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And the subtlest of all the
bodies is the karma sharir,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.657 align:middle line:84%
and it's really the karmic
body that encases the soul.

00:12:58.657 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%
That's how it's described.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So you can take this as
figurative or literative.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.578 align:middle line:84%
But essentially what happens
is everything that we do,

00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
everything that we say,
everything that we think,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:84%
every action that we
take creates a pattern.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:90%
It's an informational pattern.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So karma can be thought of
as an informational pattern.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And this informational
pattern, if we conceptualize it

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
as almost a cloud then encases
the soul, a dynamic cloud

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that's constantly moving,
kind of encasing the light,

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:90%
the pure light of the soul.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
It then follows outward with
what we call the tejas sharir,

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
or the subtle body--
the fiery body,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
as it's described in some
traditions, including Jainism--

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to where everything that
we do, think, and say

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:84%
is influenced by our
soul's consciousness

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and is influencing us
dynamically in every moment.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So when an energy
healer says, I'm

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:84%
working at the karmic level,
what I believe is going on

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:84%
is that they're getting
really deep into the layers

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:84%
of being able to move
informational patterns, which

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we might call karma,
which then unleash

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:84%
the light of the soul
more readily to foster

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:84%
that continued movement and
potentially obliteration

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of that habit pattern, of
that informational pattern.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what I find
is that if the mind is

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:84%
aware of conscious choice
in everything that we do,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:84%
an intentional choice about
everything that we think

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and every action
that we take and what

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
we say, et cetera, that it
can turn this body of energies

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.413 align:middle line:84%
into serving our entire
life experience here.

00:14:35.413 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Is this aligned
with what you're--

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
The mind's role is as an
observer and a servant,

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:90%
not a master, not a master.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But if our minds are
being driven by our habit

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:90%
patterns and our conditioning--

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
so the more we're slaves
to our conditioning--

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:84%
we're growing up in
a dualistic world.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:84%
If we follow what the
Vedic scripture said,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:84%
then we are ultimately
non-dual and everything is one.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Lila that is at
hand, the divine dance,

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is to be embodied forms of
consciousness and prakriti

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy the gifts
that have been

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:84%
given to us as
embodied souls and yet

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.643 align:middle line:90%
find our way back to oneness.

00:15:18.643 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So while we're going
through this dance,

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
we get to experience the
world, and the world affects us

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:90%
through conditioning.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And so if the mind is a
servant to conditioning,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:84%
then we just continue to
live in that dual world,

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and we don't get a
taste of the oneness.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.438 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: So that's why--

00:15:33.438 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: When in reality, it's
here to act as practice ground

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
for us to learn how to find
the oneness in the face

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:84%
of an invitation or a temptation
into this dualistic reality

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.100 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Does this align with--

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Exactly.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's so beautiful.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: And we get to play.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:90%
We get to play.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:90%
We get to learn.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:90%
We get to evolve.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
We get to see that I
am you, you are me.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
We're no different.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:84%
All of the divisiveness
that we see is just a game.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just a game.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:00.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how does the
recognition of that relate

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:90%
to healing or curing--

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
this conversation that
we're having about healing

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:90%
and curing.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.210 align:middle line:84%
How does what we're
talking about right now

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:90%
relate to those definitions?

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Thank you.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So if we can step out
of the conditioned mind

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:84%
into a deeper sense of
oneness, then the vital

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
can connect properly
with the mind guided

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
through the soul's consciousness
to be fully aligned

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.080 align:middle line:90%
and present.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us, of course,
often, feelings of well-being.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
That's not why we
do it, but that's

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
what often happens because the
taste of our soul and spirit

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
often leads us to the
feelings of bliss.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why oneness
is often described

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:90%
as [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] right?

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.925 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:45.925 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] is
the blissful part of ourselves.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And there we have the
alignment and the unblocking

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
of those mind patterns, the
conditioned mind patterns.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
The unblocking happens so
that healing can happen.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of healing,
sometimes what we call curing

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:84%
will happen where a
disease will move.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I know this
experientially myself.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I healed the
scoliosis in my body

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:90%
because of this very action.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I had an awakening,
spent 10 years

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
of my life integrating that,
and healed migraine headaches

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and a scoliosis.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't because I set
out to heal those things.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It was because I was
obsessed with integrating

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:84%
what I had awakened to,
bringing the mind and the body

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit, the breath,
back together again.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So I know for a fact
that what you're saying

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely where
we need to be living.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So I would love for
you to speak about this

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:84%
from this idea of chronic
disease, chronic illness.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.215 align:middle line:84%
A person's been told
you're going to have

00:17:48.215 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:90%
to learn to live with this.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.257 align:middle line:90%
This is the way it is.

00:17:50.257 --> 00:17:51.930 align:middle line:90%
There's no cure for this.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Based on the conversation
that we're having right now,

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:84%
the idea of such a
prognosis seems ludicrous.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it's not
a vibrational match.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't resonate.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:90%
What can you say?

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: It doesn't resonate,
and actually the data

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:90%
don't support it either.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So we all know of the
disempowering models

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.210 align:middle line:84%
that have been forced upon
so many of our patients,

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:84%
including chronic
pain patients, again,

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
stemming from this
model of pathogenesis.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.850 align:middle line:84%
There is something outside of
me that is causing my suffering,

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and I must numb myself
to the suffering

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
only thing I can do.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So patients have
been taught, you

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:90%
need to take this pain pill.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way we know
how to deal with your suffering

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:90%
and your pain.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:90%
And they've been duped.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And now we see the pendulum
swinging on the other side

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
where it's like,
well, now doctors

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:84%
are being treated as
gatekeepers and they

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
have to decide whether they
should give someone a pain pill

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, the patient's
thinking, what do I do?

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I've basically been told there's
nothing you can do for me.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.292 align:middle line:84%
I've been told that
the best thing I can do

00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:90%
is to numb my suffering.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm being told that
the medication that you're

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:84%
giving me to numb
my suffering you're

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
no longer allowed
to give me, right?

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It is a complete model
of disempowerment.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The data doesn't
even support it.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So here's what some of
the data does suggest.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:84%
We've conducted what we call
systematic reviews of energy

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
healing, what we call biofield
therapies in the science world,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And the strongest
evidence for these energy

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
therapies, whether
the Reiki healing

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
touch, all kinds of different
modalities, is for pain.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, so energy therapies
help for pain.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.720 align:middle line:84%
The Joint Commission
of Physicians

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and the National Institutes
of Health and others

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
have just come forth saying that
first-line treatments for pain

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
include acupuncture, to
a degree, mindfulness,

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and other holistic therapies,
including cranial sacral,

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:90%
chiropractic in some cases.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So these are being purported as
first-line treatments for pain.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And how do they work?

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, they work with
stimulating the vital energy

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is about writing our
own ability to heal ourselves.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
All of these holistic
practices are about

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
bringing us back to an
ability to heal ourselves.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:90%
And then we look at placebo--

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:90%
again, completely fascinating.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And you probably know of
all of the data in placebo.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But just for example, there
are now five open-label placebo

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:90%
studies.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.335 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:20:16.335 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
When I say "placebo," what do
you think most people think

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:19.995 align:middle line:90%
of, Sue, when I say "placebo?"

00:20:19.995 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
What are the words that
come to most people's minds

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
or even your own when you
hear the word "placebo?"

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Made up, psychosomatic.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Made up,
psychosomatic, fake, not real--

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:90%
all of these things.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And here you've got five
studies that are saying,

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:90%
here's a placebo.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to give you a placebo.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Placebo has actually been
shown to have profound effects

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.710 align:middle line:90%
on the mind and body.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:90%
We've seen this in studies.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So you're going
to take a placebo.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.352 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
lie to you about it.

00:20:45.352 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
see if you get better.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They do.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: This has
been found for pain.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:84%
This has been found
for chronic fatigue

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and for other
conditions as well.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We're just starting
to uncover this--

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
the researchers at Harvard that
just got a really nice sized

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
grant to look at this more
deeply in irritable bowel

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:90%
syndrome patients.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:90%
So what is this telling us?

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
We really have to think about
what kind of belief systems

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.562 align:middle line:84%
are being imposed on us, and
we have to own our own belief

00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:13.687 align:middle line:90%
systems first and foremost.

00:21:13.687 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, we have to wake up.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.093 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Yeah, we own
our own belief systems.

00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
If we can unblock ourselves
from thinking, I can't do it,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:84%
there's no hope, all of those
things-- once we can unblock,

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:90%
that's the first step, right?

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So what we call placebo,
elements, expectation,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:84%
all of that, they're
in science what

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:90%
we call moderating factors.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.140 align:middle line:90%
We have to open that gate.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Once we open that
gate of belief,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
we open our abilities to
really believe in healing

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and believe in our
own, in a power

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.467 align:middle line:84%
to foster what we want
to see in the world.

00:21:43.467 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything changes, as you know.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.508 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It becomes a
different smorgasbord

00:21:46.508 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
of selecting our
focused intentionality,

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that that alone is
what is doing the healing in so

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:90%
many of these cases.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It's such a fascinating world.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of
patients come to you?

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Who comes to you?

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Who shows up in your world?

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.647 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: You know,
everyone really.

00:22:04.647 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these days I do
most of my teaching in kind

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:90%
of large groups or workshops.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:90%
And so we get lots of folks.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
We get folks that are
suffering from pain or mystery

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:90%
illnesses a lot.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:10%
People come to us because
they have mystery illnesses

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:10%
with people that are
just really struggling

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:10%
with meaning and
purpose in their lives

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:10%
and those that are
struggling from depression,

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:10%
which, as you know, is such
a major issue in our world.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Over 300 million
people worldwide,

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:84%
at least, suffer from
major depression.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And you might know that,
unfortunately, the US

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.580 align:middle line:84%
is experiencing,
for the third year

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.313 align:middle line:90%
in a row, lower life expectancy.

00:22:42.313 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:84%
So our life
expectancy is actually

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.772 align:middle line:90%
going down instead of up.

00:22:44.772 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And the major drivers of
that are suicidality and drug

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.730 align:middle line:90%
overdose.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What do you think
has happened in the largest

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
picture with the systems that
you're so deeply affluent in?

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
What has happened
with these people that

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.690 align:middle line:84%
are landing in such a state of
disempowerment and depression

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:90%
and pain cycles, et cetera?

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
What has happened
energetically with them

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.758 align:middle line:84%
or from the biggest picture
perspective in your opinion?

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: I think one
of the key things

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.110 align:middle line:84%
is we're disconnected
from our bodies.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a big thing.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:90%
We live in the mind.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:90%
We're conditioned in the mind.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.157 align:middle line:84%
We are bombarded
with influences that

00:23:24.157 --> 00:23:26.240 align:middle line:84%
tell us that we're not
good enough, that we're not

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
smart enough, that we're
not rich enough, that all

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:84%
of these things, that
we're not enough in all

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:90%
of these different ways.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the core of so
much of our suffering.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's so interesting
because we're made of spirit

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and our journey is to come
here and be fully human.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But halfway here, we
interrupt the journey

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and try to start going back
seeking spiritual orientation

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and, as you're saying,
dropping into the body would

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.513 align:middle line:90%
be be the solution.

00:23:53.513 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it makes perfect sense
because that's our destination.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
We set out to come
into this body.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: That's right.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: But we never really
make the journey completed,

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.072 align:middle line:90%
and we suffer because of that.

00:24:02.072 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: And I mean,
I'll just share

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:84%
with you from my own
personal experience.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:84%
There were times that I really
questioned why I was in a body

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.240 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes it can feel
really limiting in a body.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
after having children

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
that I really witnessed
the joy of having a body

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and having two souls
in a body, and what

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:90%
an amazing experience that is.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:84%
It really brought me
into a deep respect

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
for being a soul in
a body, first of all,

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and what the magic
is of embodiment.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
these teachings

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:84%
from spiritual masters like
Sri Aurobindo and the Mother

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
that are saying the
time is different now.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the way that
the Vedic scriptures have

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:10%
been interpreted in the past
is about transcending the body.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does
that mean really?

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
They talked about
transcending the senses.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:10%
And so for a lot of traditions,
the way that was described

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:10%
is shutting off almost, right?

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.408 align:middle line:84%
But it's exactly the
opposite, actually.

00:24:55.408 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:90%
It's completely opposite.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's becoming all that
and more, not instead of,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.445 align:middle line:90%
but all this and more.

00:25:00.445 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: All this and more--
and so the Mother talks

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
about the consciousness of
cells, which is also reflected

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:84%
in Jain teachings as a
way of bringing spirits

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
so fully into the body
and into the earth

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and into the physical reality
that we can transform it.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.688 align:middle line:84%
So that's the work
that's upon us, right?

00:25:19.688 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the work that's upon us.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But it can be a
very joyful thing.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be a long,
laborious, painful process,

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So much to explore.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's say-- circle the
wagons here for a little bit.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Someone's watching.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:90%
They have chronic pain.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.510 align:middle line:84%
They're in a deep
depression cycle.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:90%
They want out of it.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's just drop in.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.320 align:middle line:90%
What's the first thing?

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's just-- maybe it's a recap.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something
new comes to mind.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:90%
What's my first go-to?

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking suicidal thoughts.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be here.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't make sense out of this.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I seem disempowered.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Where do I start?

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
What do I do right
now that's going

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
to allow me to know there's
something bigger at play here

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:90%
and I too can tap into it?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It's for me too,
not just that select

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:84%
few or the fortunate
ones or the illuminated.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:90%
How do I begin?

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Thank you.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, the first thing
that I would say--

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:90%
and this might sound weird--

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:90%
is that it's OK to suffer.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.445 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to suffer.

00:26:18.445 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
We almost want to just numb
ourselves from our suffering.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:90%
So we're human.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:90%
We all suffer in different ways.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But this is the other
truth that we know.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Deeply we know this
within ourselves.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
It's of course been taught
in the spiritual traditions.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is permanent.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is permanent.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to suffer, but
nothing is permanent.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Not even our suffering
is permanent,

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:84%
even though it
may feel that way.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.180 align:middle line:10%
And the biggest thing that
we can do to help ourselves

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:10%
is recognize that we are
not our conditioned minds.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So by recognizing that
we are spirit beings

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're coming into this
body and there's suffering

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.280 align:middle line:90%
associated with that--

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
let me just be clear that it
seems that what you're saying

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
is if we can come
present to the suffering,

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:84%
then the suffering
will dissolve.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:84%
The experience is not something
that is overwhelming to us

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
when we can come present
to it and be with it,

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:84%
that it starts to emerge this
mind-body union that we're

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
speaking about as an actual
part of the healing process.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's OK to suffer,
meaning embrace it.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to negate it.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And we become the creative
force that we really

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:84%
are in this body on
this planet, and we

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:84%
start to experience ourselves
as the presence that

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.605 align:middle line:90%
is the healing.

00:27:39.605 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: That is
absolutely right.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And as we embrace suffering
and we don't shy away from it,

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:84%
we also open ourselves to
the totality of experience,

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:90%
including joy.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:10%
So it's not that we have to
be suffering our whole lives.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But we just be present
with where it is,

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:90%
and we'll notice that it shifts.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if we really start
to follow and track our pain,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:10%
we'll realize that, even though
we might think it's constant,

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:10%
it's not.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.790 align:middle line:90%
It moves.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Everything moves.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.057 align:middle line:84%
As you know,
everything constantly

00:28:07.057 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:90%
fluctuates in the body.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:10%
We are a dynamic field of
energy and information,

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.070 align:middle line:10%
and we are always shifting.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's hope there
in knowing that I

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:90%
can turn towards my suffering.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I can embrace it
lovingly and also

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.170 align:middle line:84%
recognize it's going to move
just like everything moves.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.808 align:middle line:10%
I know that, as well,
from experience,

00:28:25.808 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:10%
that what you're saying
is absolutely true.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And as I would move
with the pain that

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.530 align:middle line:84%
was happening in my
body and in my life,

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:84%
it would evolve and
evolve, and that's

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:84%
how this whole scoliosis
unwound itself.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:41.550 align:middle line:84%
That's how my own system began
to have a different reference

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:90%
point for what mattered most.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.258 align:middle line:84%
And it was very liberating,
extraordinarily liberating.

00:28:47.258 --> 00:28:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: That's wonderful.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and you
spoke of unwinding,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
which is an
interesting term to use

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.060 align:middle line:84%
because another just
kind of practice

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that I find very useful
for just about everyone,

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:84%
but including pain, depression,
or just when you're feeling

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:84%
patterns of darkness,
is a technique

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that I first learned from
my teacher Reverend Rosalyn

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Bruyere and Ken
Weintraub, and they

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.515 align:middle line:90%
called it unwinding meditation.

00:29:08.515 --> 00:29:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes when we think
when we sit in meditation,

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.880 align:middle line:90%
we have to be really still.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.380 align:middle line:84%
We keep this back
straight and all that.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.140 align:middle line:84%
We want to foster the
energy flow in the body.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
But once we have a sense
of grounding and presence

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.580 align:middle line:84%
in the body and we
feel the energy,

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.820 align:middle line:84%
we can then allow the body
to just spontaneously,

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:90%
literally unwind itself.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.132 align:middle line:84%
And so you may be guided for the
body to move in a certain way.

00:29:29.132 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That's exactly
what was happening.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes, isn't that amazing?

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the body
knows what to do.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:37.102 align:middle line:84%
The vital force, when it's
driven by the soul's force--

00:29:37.102 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And the mind is
allowing that to happen.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: And the
mind is opening--

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Letting go.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: --and just holding
and just being the observer.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm just watching.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Whoa, I'm moving in all
these different ways.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, don't judge.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:10%
Just be here, watch it
move, and it's amazing.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:10%
These patterns, whether you want
to call the karmic patterns,

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:10%
sanskaras, whatever
you want to call them,

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.700 align:middle line:10%
they unwind themselves
naturally just

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:10%
by holding that loving
presence and allowing the body

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:10%
to freely move.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's just so joyful
to hear your conversation.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:84%
I know that this is so,
so helpful for people.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you've had experience

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:84%
with some pretty serious
cases and clients.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:19.112 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your process
with the cancer individuals

00:30:19.112 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that you were working
with in particular.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:84%
It was really a gift to be
able to work these women.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And the inspiration
for it is, as you know,

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Sue, fatigue is the
number one complaint

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:84%
among breast cancer
patients, all cancer

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:90%
patients and survivors.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So what some people
don't know is

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that even after you're
done with treatment,

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:84%
we do know now there's
new data suggesting

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
that if you go
through chemotherapy,

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:84%
it does increase your
likelihood of feeling

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:90%
fatigue, these sorts of things.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just we're dealing with
medicine as best we can.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.127 align:middle line:90%
There are some side effects.

00:30:51.127 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.980 align:middle line:90%
No judgment, no blame.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's doing
the best they can.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But there are side
effects, and we

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.330 align:middle line:84%
have to figure out how to
mitigate those side effects

00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.920 align:middle line:90%
or even prevent them, right?

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have so many people
after cancer treatment that

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.030 align:middle line:84%
are suffering from
such debilitating

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
amounts of fatigue, including
brain fog, inability

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.745 align:middle line:84%
to get up and move, inability
to just sort of function

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:14.620 align:middle line:84%
in their everyday life
and do the things that

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:90%
made them joyful--

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.042 align:middle line:90%
exercise, whatever they are.

00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:20.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge problem, and there's
no gold standard treatment

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And being a healing student
and a healing practitioner,

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, why
aren't we looking

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:90%
at energy healing for this?

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems like
a no-brainer, right?

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Stimulate the vital
energy flow in the body.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.490 align:middle line:90%
These folks are depleted.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:10%
They've gone through so much.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.090 align:middle line:10%
So I went to Rosalyn and
I said, what would you

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:10%
do for these patients?

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.407 align:middle line:84%
If we were going to do a study,
a randomized controlled trial

00:31:41.407 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:84%
looking at the effects of
this, what would you do?

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:90%
And she said, chelation.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:90%
So what is chelation?

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just a hands-on,
basic technique on the body

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:84%
where you're stimulating
bone marrow chi

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and you're drawing
toxicities away from the body

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
by fostering vital energy
flow through the body.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.700 align:middle line:90%
So we did a clinical trial.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And because I was
in academia at UCSD,

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.610 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of interest
in, well, is this placebo,

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.318 align:middle line:84%
are these just placebo
effects, whatever.

00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:07.180 align:middle line:90%
So we did our placebo arm.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.460 align:middle line:84%
We had a group of
skeptical scientists

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.490 align:middle line:84%
who mimic the hand positions
who were super nice.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:84%
We did all the
sessions in silence.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:84%
We had patients, no matter
whether they were in the energy

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.750 align:middle line:84%
group or what we call the
touch-alone group, which

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:21.668 align:middle line:84%
we said, hey, touch
fosters healing too.

00:32:21.668 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So you guys are going to
get something no matter.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.418 align:middle line:84%
You're either going
to get energy healing

00:32:25.418 --> 00:32:27.130 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to get touch.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:28.867 align:middle line:84%
Both have been shown
to be effective

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:30.700 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to get
a weightless control.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:90%
You'll get treatment later.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.068 align:middle line:84%
We're going to measure
you on all these things,

00:32:34.068 --> 00:32:37.180 align:middle line:84%
like fatigue, depression,
quality of life,

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and cortisol variability,
which is the rhythm of cortisol

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.120 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to look at
all of these different things

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:90%
and just see what happens.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, those
patients were so happy

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.090 align:middle line:84%
that they were being
studied and that something

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:84%
was being done to look at
treatments for fatigue--

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that of itself
was an eye opener.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
I had patients calling
me from Florida.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.445 align:middle line:84%
Here I was in
California saying, I'm

00:32:58.445 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:84%
so happy you guys
are doing this study.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me what
I can do for fatigue,

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.887 align:middle line:84%
because my doctor wants to
give me an SSRI for depression

00:33:04.887 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:84%
because he thinks that's
going to help my fatigue.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind of the
state of things, right?

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.570 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, what did we find?

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.930 align:middle line:84%
We found that the actual energy
healing not only dramatically

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:90%
reduced fatigue.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Within a month, these
women had dropped

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to levels of what you would find
for the normative population,

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
the person walking
down the street.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Their fatigue had
literally just plummeted.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
kind of function

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.630 align:middle line:90%
in their everyday life.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.450 align:middle line:90%
They were happy.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Their brain fog had lifted.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Their quality of life had
improved, all these things.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But also, the rhythms of
cortisol in their body

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:90%
improved.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is important
because rhythms of cortisol,

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:84%
you might know, people think
of it as a stress hormone.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything follows a
rhythm in the body.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So usually cortisol peaks when
we wake up and then kind of

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.590 align:middle line:90%
goes down during the body.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:84%
That's important
because it talks

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:84%
to our inflammatory
immune system.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.487 align:middle line:84%
All these systems
in the body need

00:33:55.487 --> 00:33:58.000 align:middle line:84%
to be talking to
each other correctly.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.860 align:middle line:84%
For breast cancer
patients who are

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.450 align:middle line:84%
experiencing
depression and fatigue,

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:02.680 align:middle line:90%
that rhythm is altered.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.090 align:middle line:90%
It could be completely flat.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It could be wonky for
many different reasons.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:10.738 align:middle line:84%
What we found was a
normalization of that rhythm.

00:34:10.738 --> 00:34:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's super
important because it

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.530 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be associated with
the reductions in fatigue

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, wow.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.409 align:middle line:84%
We'd love to be able to have
these kinds of practices

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:24.070 align:middle line:84%
more readily integrated into
the hospital and into clinics.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.510 align:middle line:90%
And the good news is they are.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:29.260 align:middle line:84%
There are many academic centers
for integrative medicine

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that are now incorporating some
of these biofilled therapies

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.760 align:middle line:90%
into their suite of services.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's starting to happen.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.625 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to have more
studies like that so we

00:34:38.625 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:84%
can take those
studies and we can

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.270 align:middle line:84%
say to the heads of hospitals
or whatever, this is real.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:84%
This impacts people down to
not only the spiritual levels,

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.670 align:middle line:84%
which are, I would say,
the most important,

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.980 align:middle line:84%
but the psychological
and the physical levels.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's no side
effects to this treatment.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So once we do more studies
like this and, honestly,

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:01.000 align:middle line:84%
we show more cost
effectiveness, the bottom line,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.092 align:middle line:84%
which is what matters
for hospitals a lot--

00:35:03.092 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:90%
is it going to save me money?

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.258 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to keep people
out of the hospital?

00:35:06.258 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to really
keep them more well?

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Then we'll get there, yeah.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So there were trained
energy healers and placebo

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.020 align:middle line:90%
healers.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about placebo
a little more deeply.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Just speak to us.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Sure.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine,
a lot of the energy

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.100 align:middle line:84%
healers that I talked to were
like, why are you guys doing

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.710 align:middle line:84%
this, and why are you calling it
placebo, because energy moves.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you got a
healthy person--

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and these were healthy people--

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.423 align:middle line:84%
touching a person
who's not healthy,

00:35:33.423 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:84%
energy's just going to flow
from them to the other person.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we did
see some effects

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.988 align:middle line:90%
on fatigue, which are important.

00:35:38.988 --> 00:35:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's just kind of
good common sense, right?

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're laying down
on a table twice a week,

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and you're being touched
by a benevolent person,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and energy flow happens,
you're going to get better.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But the trained energy
healers, actually,

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:84%
because of their ability to
really focus and move energy,

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.550 align:middle line:84%
did even better
than those people.

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:00.020 align:middle line:90%
So what is placebo?

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
a fascinating topic.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.783 align:middle line:84%
And I would say we
have placebo all wrong,

00:36:04.783 --> 00:36:06.200 align:middle line:84%
the way we've
described it before.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It's based in a materialist
model of medicine that

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.780 align:middle line:84%
says all medicine is
real if it's physical,

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and only physical
medicine is real.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, placebo is not real.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.750 align:middle line:84%
It's fake, all these
things that we say.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But yet, it seems to point
to the abilities of the mind

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:90%
and the body to heal itself.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So I have a framework that
I call placebo equals HEAL--

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Holistic Elements That
Activate Life Force,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.970 align:middle line:84%
because that's really
what we're talking about.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the power
of cultivating presence,

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:36.540 align:middle line:90%
first and foremost.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So whether I'm a
healer, a physician,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.820 align:middle line:84%
whatever, the presence
that I come in with

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:84%
is going to foster the presence
that's in that patient,

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.254 align:middle line:84%
fostering presence in
that dyadic relationship.

00:36:47.254 --> 00:36:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Relationship is huge.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's another,
quote, "placebo" element.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:84%
We've seen time and
time again studies

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that have shown
that not only how

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.340 align:middle line:84%
friendly and affable the
doctor is to the patient

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:84%
will influence the patient's
outcomes, including

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.190 align:middle line:84%
immune system outcomes, but
how much the doctor believes

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:07.600 align:middle line:84%
that their patient can get well
will influence their outcome.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.140 align:middle line:90%
So relationship is key.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Placebo
surgery-- speak to us.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Placebo surgery, yeah.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So if all of this just sort
of sounds like a great theory,

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:84%
then you might
wonder in practice,

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.160 align:middle line:84%
how far does placebo go and
what does the data really say?

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So we mentioned the
open-label placebo studies

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.120 align:middle line:84%
of telling people they
could have a placebo

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:90%
and how that fostered benefits.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:84%
But what a lot of people don't
know is that there have been,

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I think, about 39
randomized controlled trials

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that have examined the effects
of surgery compared to placebo.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And Wayne Jonas and colleagues
published a systematic review

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
compiling the data from
all of these studies.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
published in 2015.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was for
nearly every type of surgery,

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:84%
whether it was for gut or other
issues, placebo elements--

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:84%
that is, the placebo surgery
accounted for almost 70%

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:90%
of the effects in some cases--

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.530 align:middle line:84%
really huge effects that were
basically found from placebo.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.720 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:84%
This was a group of
people that were told they

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:90%
were going to get the surgery.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.975 align:middle line:84%
They may have
gotten an incision.

00:38:10.975 --> 00:38:12.350 align:middle line:84%
They were put
through anesthesia.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So they were led to believe that
they actually got a physical

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.720 align:middle line:90%
surgery, but they didn't.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
told that initially.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So then their outcomes
were measured.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And so they responded up to
70% as well as the people

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:90%
who got the actual surgery.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have it
all backwards, right?

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not the physical
intervention as much

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.240 align:middle line:84%
as it is our minds
and bodies that

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.180 align:middle line:84%
first have to be set
to foster that healing.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the
physical medicine may

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.680 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on top of that,
but it's not the main thing.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the adjunct, actually.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.015 align:middle line:84%
Obviously if someone is told
they're having a surgery--

00:38:49.015 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I read a report
about a gentleman

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.970 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to play
basketball with his grandson,

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:84%
had been chair ridden
for years, four years,

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and decided to
have knee surgery--

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.950 align:middle line:90%
went, had the incision--

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:90%
it was a placebo surgery.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:84%
They made the incision,
opened the joint capsule,

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
wiggled things around a
little bit, closed it back up,

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and put him through
rehab, typical rehab

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:84%
after a standard
surgery of this nature,

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and he was out
playing basketball

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.730 align:middle line:84%
with his grandson in
a matter of weeks.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Amazing, right?

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:22.023 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And nothing had happened.

00:39:22.023 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:84%
It was simply his mind believing
that that had taken place.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
what you're saying

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:33.330 align:middle line:84%
is tapping the most
powerful tool that we have,

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.510 align:middle line:90%
and that is the use of the mind.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.240 align:middle line:84%
When we're attached to the mind,
it gets harder to use the mind.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But when we unattach
from the mind

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and realize that we
are this spirit being

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.740 align:middle line:84%
here that has a mind,
everything begins

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to change when we
use it for what

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:51.290 align:middle line:84%
it is meant to be used for,
in service to this bigger,

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:90%
bigger picture.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: It's so true.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we know, of course,
that this is a very big topic.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Someone might be wondering,
what if I go in for a surgery

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to do
this placebo surgery on me?

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.790 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not interested in that.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And we have to acknowledge
that these people are

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.860 align:middle line:84%
knowing that they're
participating

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.735 align:middle line:90%
in something experimental.

00:40:11.735 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
case that I'm citing

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.100 align:middle line:84%
is the gentleman knew
that he was going

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.730 align:middle line:84%
to be going in for an
experimental type of procedure,

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and he wasn't
giving the details,

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.270 align:middle line:84%
but he was agreeing
to participate

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.730 align:middle line:90%
in this new perspective.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't that people
have to start worrying about

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:90%
if I'm signing up to--

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Get surgery.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --go and have a surgery,
are they really doing it

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.560 align:middle line:90%
or are they not?

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.335 align:middle line:84%
It's a little more controlled
than that, for sure.

00:40:37.335 --> 00:40:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, very much so.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
knowing that they're

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:41.700 align:middle line:90%
entering a clinical trial.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.110 align:middle line:84%
They may be actually
told, in some cases,

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
you may get a placebo
surgery or a real surgery

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.825 align:middle line:84%
or they may be told, as in
the case of your colleague,

00:40:48.825 --> 00:40:50.325 align:middle line:84%
it's another
experimental procedure.

00:40:50.325 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And then basically
every single time

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:84%
that happens, eventually
they are told.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.470 align:middle line:84%
If they were in the placebo arm,
they're told that they were.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they're offered the
actual surgery if they want it.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: If they still want it.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Going in, they
have some idea that they're

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:04.590 align:middle line:90%
going to be randomized.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: They're participating
in research of some sort.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Exactly.

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:08.940 align:middle line:84%
They're chosen by
chance in that way.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: All of which can still
play into the mind agreeing.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I may be getting
the actual surgery.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I may be getting a placebo.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It's up to me to
let it work for me.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm surrendering,
and I'm all in,

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and then we're given this
new data, which is just

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.760 align:middle line:90%
fascinating for us to explore.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: It's really
interesting, actually,

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.100 align:middle line:84%
because it reminds me of a
patient in our cancer fatigue

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:30.900 align:middle line:90%
trial.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:31.817 align:middle line:90%
We had the same thing.

00:41:31.817 --> 00:41:34.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it wasn't as dramatic,
but we told our patients,

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.700 align:middle line:10%
you're either going
to get touch alone

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:10%
or you're going to
get energy healing

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.420 align:middle line:10%
and we're not going to tell
you which one until after.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you did get
touch alone, we

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.550 align:middle line:84%
have the ability, thanks
to some funding support,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.410 align:middle line:84%
to give you energy
healing sessions

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.210 align:middle line:90%
after the study is over.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And so CNN actually did a
really great piece on one

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.455 align:middle line:84%
of our patients, Linda,
who had this experience.

00:41:53.455 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:10%
She first went through
the touch alone,

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.560 align:middle line:10%
so she could talk about what was
that like just being touched,

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.020 align:middle line:10%
and then what was the
difference for her afterwards

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:10%
when she received
the energy healing?

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And what she had to say
was pretty profound.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:09.840 align:middle line:84%
It was really interesting to
hear a patient's perspective

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.290 align:middle line:84%
on what it's like to go through
a, quote, "placebo" and then

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.570 align:middle line:84%
what it's like to
get, in our case

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.210 align:middle line:84%
with the energy healing,
the actual healing itself.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, fascinating.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Shamini is the president
and CEO of the Consciousness

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.710 align:middle line:90%
and Healing Initiative, or CHI.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Shamini formed this initiative
to create a diverse community

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:90%
of healers and scientists.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.582 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:42:33.582 --> 00:42:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>>DEAN RADIN: The reason
why an organization like CHI

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:10%
is so important is because
it brings together people

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.990 align:middle line:10%
from many disciplines that are
interested in mind and matter

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.180 align:middle line:10%
as it is related to health.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.440 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD HAMMERSCHLAG: So we're
attracting young scientists

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.580 align:middle line:10%
and old scientists retired,
scientists and people who've

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:10%
done this kind of work in
the closet, if you like,

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.300 align:middle line:10%
for a while.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.590 align:middle line:10%
We're bringing
consciousness and healing

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.440 align:middle line:10%
studies out of the closet.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.920 align:middle line:10%
>> CHI is made up of some
of the most extraordinary

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.630 align:middle line:10%
individuals--

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:14.190 align:middle line:10%
top scientists in the field,
people at major universities,

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:16.500 align:middle line:10%
clinicians like myself.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.780 align:middle line:10%
So when you put
together in a room

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:10%
the best of science,
the best of practice,

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:10%
and you begin to
start to translate

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.570 align:middle line:10%
that science into practice,
we have nothing short

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:10%
of a revolution,
really, that's going

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:34.110 align:middle line:10%
to transform the way we think
about health and healing.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.756 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.756 --> 00:43:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: CHI, C-H-I--
what are these people?

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Who are they that
are coming together?

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Please tell us more.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, thank you.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.300 align:middle line:84%
CHI is a wonderful
collaborative ,

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's a growing
collaborative.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.800 align:middle line:84%
It's been my honor
to be its steward

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.170 align:middle line:84%
over the past several
years, and it really

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:58.290 align:middle line:84%
began with a shared vision
and a shared mission

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.020 align:middle line:84%
to ignite healing
in all of humanity

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and to help lead humanity
to heal ourselves.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what we've
done is we've just

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.870 align:middle line:84%
been an attractor for
top-notch scientists

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:84%
who are really willing
to ask the deeper

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.190 align:middle line:84%
questions around
consciousness and healing

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and collaborate with healers all
around the globe who are also

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.430 align:middle line:84%
completely dedicated to
the exploration of healing,

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:23.280 align:middle line:84%
including from the scientific
level as well as the practice

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.310 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:27.380 align:middle line:84%
We also unite different
stakeholders in the process.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.430 align:middle line:10%
So for example, partners
include the Institute

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:33.420 align:middle line:10%
of Noetic Sciences, the Chopra
Foundation, Miracle Foundation,

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:10%
and so many others that are
coming together and saying,

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:10%
here's what we have to offer.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way for us to
begin to collect our wisdom,

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.140 align:middle line:90%
share our wisdom.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.080 align:middle line:84%
We have public events that
we do, educational events,

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.000 align:middle line:84%
webinars on healing
where we bring the latest

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.120 align:middle line:84%
science and practice of healing
to the community at large.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're also fostering
trust and collaboration

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.090 align:middle line:84%
among the scientists,
especially those that are

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.618 align:middle line:90%
placed in major universities.

00:44:58.618 --> 00:45:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And we've been really
blessed and fortunate to be

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.840 align:middle line:84%
working with top-notch
researchers in the field.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And these researchers,
I should add ,

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.580 align:middle line:84%
are really well-seasoned
researchers who get millions

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.210 align:middle line:84%
of dollars in NIH grants
for their mainstream work.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So as I was going through
my process of doing

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:84%
this clinical trial,
I started meeting

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.990 align:middle line:84%
all of these other
amazing scientists

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.642 align:middle line:84%
that were covertly, almost,
doing this research in healing,

00:45:22.642 --> 00:45:24.100 align:middle line:84%
or if they weren't
covert about it,

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.900 align:middle line:84%
they really didn't
have funding for it

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.810 align:middle line:84%
because the NIH would not
fund this kind of work.

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:31.190 align:middle line:84%
They had trouble
publishing their data

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:32.872 align:middle line:84%
because the reviewers
just couldn't

00:45:32.872 --> 00:45:35.080 align:middle line:84%
believe that such a thing
as energy healing was real.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.163 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I even had scientific
colleagues literally

00:45:37.163 --> 00:45:39.370 align:middle line:84%
write letters to the
editor and say, look,

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.590 align:middle line:84%
you know that if I sent
you this exact same paper

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.645 align:middle line:84%
and it was a drug,
you would have

00:45:43.645 --> 00:45:44.770 align:middle line:90%
no problem publishing this.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:46.387 align:middle line:84%
But because it's on
therapeutic touch

00:45:46.387 --> 00:45:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and even though it's a
well-controlled trial

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.530 align:middle line:84%
with therapeutic touch,
mock therapeutic touch,

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:54.897 align:middle line:84%
looking at the effects
in bone and tissue cells,

00:45:54.897 --> 00:45:56.230 align:middle line:90%
you're having trouble with this.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:00.173 align:middle line:10%
So we realized that we needed
to create a safe, trusted space

00:46:00.173 --> 00:46:02.590 align:middle line:10%
for scientists to be able to
talk to each other about this

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:04.215 align:middle line:10%
so that we could move
the field forward

00:46:04.215 --> 00:46:07.570 align:middle line:10%
collaboratively and create
that trusted, safe space for us

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:08.500 align:middle line:10%
to explore.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So CHI really started with
that, and it's just grown

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:15.790 align:middle line:84%
tremendously into fostering
what we call trans-disciplinary

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:18.010 align:middle line:84%
collaborations-- that
is, multiple perspectives

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:18.940 align:middle line:90%
on healing--

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.890 align:middle line:84%
designing studies,
executing studies

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.990 align:middle line:84%
to look at different
types of healing,

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:25.480 align:middle line:84%
including hands-on
healing approaches

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.090 align:middle line:84%
all the way to distant
healing approaches, the power

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.280 align:middle line:84%
of meditation as a
collective, looking

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.710 align:middle line:84%
at how our biofields
might synchronize

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.100 align:middle line:84%
when we meditate together,
these sorts of things.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You know, I was
raised in a family.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.020 align:middle line:84%
My father was a pioneer
in energy medicine.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.860 align:middle line:84%
It is so wonderful to see
that these are the topics

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that our collaborators are
focusing on at this time

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.540 align:middle line:84%
because 40 years ago this would
not have been a conversation.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.090 align:middle line:84%
It's so exciting to
be witnessing humanity

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:58.300 align:middle line:84%
realizing we have to study
our way back together

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:02.920 align:middle line:84%
again in a new way with
all of our new education

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.620 align:middle line:84%
that's been made available to
us through the advancements

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.310 align:middle line:90%
in our technology, et cetera.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yeah, it's true.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say we're
just beginning,

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of work that
we need to do to sort of bridge

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.050 align:middle line:84%
with the larger community
of science and medicine.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:20.620 align:middle line:84%
It's still very much considered
fringe, I'm not going to lie.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It's still very hard for
people to publish papers.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have
groundbreaking studies

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that are coming out
every year, sometimes

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.482 align:middle line:90%
every couple of months.

00:47:28.482 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:84%
One that just comes to mind
that people should know about--

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why
this isn't front-page news

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.360 align:middle line:90%
everywhere--

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:84%
is a study that our
colleague Lorenzo

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Cohen, who is the director
for Integrative Medicine

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Research at MD
Anderson Cancer Center,

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.108 align:middle line:84%
has just done with
healer Sean Harribance.

00:47:45.108 --> 00:47:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to know
that they were working

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.345 align:middle line:90%
on the study for quite a while.

00:47:48.345 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And we could tell
lots of stories

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.330 align:middle line:84%
about just what
is it like to have

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.790 align:middle line:84%
these healer-scientists
collaborations?

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
work that has to be

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.780 align:middle line:84%
done to foster the right
protocols, build the trust.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous amount that
goes into these studies, not

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:03.670 align:middle line:90%
just conducting them.

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:05.210 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what they found was that
bioenergy, emitted bioenergy,

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.485 align:middle line:84%
as from Sean Harribance
in particular,

00:48:11.485 --> 00:48:15.790 align:middle line:84%
this particular healer,
was able to shrink tumors

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.550 align:middle line:90%
in a mouse model of cancer.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And they looked
at immune markers.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.480 align:middle line:84%
They looked at all kinds of
different inflammatory immune

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.460 align:middle line:84%
markers and other
markers to start

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.070 align:middle line:84%
to explore, how does
this work, because we

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.930 align:middle line:84%
hear healers talking
about shrinking tumors

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:90%
all the time, right?

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:35.010 align:middle line:10%
But if you went and gave
that paper to your typical MD

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.970 align:middle line:10%
or doctor, they're going
to look at it and say,

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:38.428 align:middle line:10%
I have a really
hard time believing

00:48:38.428 --> 00:48:40.120 align:middle line:10%
this is true even
though it's published

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.830 align:middle line:10%
and I know this is
a solid scientist.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of why we
are fostering research

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.320 align:middle line:90%
at many different labs.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to come out
of just one institute or one

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.300 align:middle line:90%
lab or one university.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.760 align:middle line:10%
We really need a preponderance
of data for people

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.900 align:middle line:10%
to look at this and say, wow,
this is really a there, there.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Wow, we really need to be
looking at this more deeply.

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So part of it is making it safe
for scientists, like Lorenzo

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.465 align:middle line:84%
and others, to come out of
the closet and do the work,

00:49:10.465 --> 00:49:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and there's safety in
numbers, quite frankly,

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.040 align:middle line:84%
because people get attacked,
I'm not going to lie.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:14.980 align:middle line:90%
People do.

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You bet.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, time is on
our side because what we know

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:22.060 align:middle line:84%
is humanity is waking up, and
we are no longer satisfied

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.180 align:middle line:84%
with the ways that we've
been taught and been

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.760 align:middle line:84%
led into the approaches
that perhaps were well

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.300 align:middle line:84%
intended along the way years
ago and even cutting edge

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.140 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But we're outgrowing our
model of approach to healing.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: We have to.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.507 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so time
is on our side.

00:49:38.507 --> 00:49:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Eventually there will
be enough of this

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.600 align:middle line:84%
that it is too much to
ignore, too much to suppress.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And I agree, that as we come
from this grand neutrality

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.840 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of different
research projects

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.955 align:middle line:84%
coming forth for just
the information itself,

00:49:52.955 --> 00:49:54.580 align:middle line:84%
we know that it's
going to birth itself

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.860 align:middle line:84%
right into the mainstream
at some point in time.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes, it will.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's exciting.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.110 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIN: Yeah, and so
we're playing our role

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.070 align:middle line:10%
as the catalyst, the
collaborative accelerator

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.690 align:middle line:10%
to have this happen
sooner than later.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, do our part.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes.

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Biofield energy is
one of the cornerstones

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of research within the
Consciousness and Healing

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Initiative.

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:15.622 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at what a CHI
member has to say about it.

00:50:15.622 --> 00:50:17.830 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL MILLS: One area that
the Consciousness Healing

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:21.040 align:middle line:10%
Initiative has been
focusing on is the biofield.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.470 align:middle line:10%
And as far as what
exactly is the biofield

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:26.110 align:middle line:10%
from my point of view,
it's an energy field

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.910 align:middle line:10%
that surrounds and
permeates the body.

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:10%
If we can reliably
measure the connections

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.150 align:middle line:10%
between consciousness, between
the biofield and our health,

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:37.220 align:middle line:10%
then that to me as a
game changer in science,

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.220 align:middle line:10%
and it's a game
changer in medicine.

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Tell us
about the biofield.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: It's the new term for
a very old concept, right?

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, yes.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: And honestly, scientists
can argue about this all day

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.060 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.400 align:middle line:84%
We love to talk about
terms and concepts.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But what we've
kind of landed on,

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:84%
describing what
the biofield is, is

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.420 align:middle line:84%
a set of interacting and
inner-penetrating fields

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.010 align:middle line:84%
of energy and information
that guide our health.

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:02.010 align:middle line:90%
It's really that simple.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK, let's say that again.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Sure.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interactive.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: A set of interactive
and inner-penetrating fields

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.290 align:middle line:84%
of energy and information
that guide our health.

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So different layers
of frequencies of energy

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:84%
that are interactive and
all collectively having

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.560 align:middle line:90%
an influence on our health.

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Exactly.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So Sue, the biofield,
as you know,

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.253 align:middle line:84%
is a term that we've made to
be as inclusive as possible

00:51:27.253 --> 00:51:29.170 align:middle line:84%
at this point, because
the truth of the matter

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.220 align:middle line:84%
is, from a scientific
point of view,

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.910 align:middle line:84%
we've just scratched the surface
of understanding how healing

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:34.900 align:middle line:90%
works, right?

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So the biofield is meant to
be this inclusive term that

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.280 align:middle line:84%
allows us to explore both
those aspects of energy

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and information
that are measurable.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:45.870 align:middle line:90%
And what are we talking about?

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
things like EKG and EEG

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:50.952 align:middle line:84%
that we know we can
measure off of the body

00:51:50.952 --> 00:51:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and it tells us something about
our state of health, right?

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.330 align:middle line:84%
We can look at pulsed
electromagnetic field

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:55.930 align:middle line:90%
stimulation.

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:57.430 align:middle line:84%
We have a sense of
the signal that's

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.740 align:middle line:84%
being put in that is at
least somewhat measurable

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.490 align:middle line:84%
or some aspect of it
is measurable, right?

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's fostering
healing in someone.

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:05.560 align:middle line:10%
So there's those
aspects of the biofield,

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.050 align:middle line:10%
and then there's the
subtle energy aspect

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:11.440 align:middle line:10%
that has been known and
worked with for millennia

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.960 align:middle line:10%
to foster healing, the
vital life force, the things

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:18.130 align:middle line:10%
that still kind of defy
outward measurement today.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:20.560 align:middle line:84%
We have our own inner
measurement of it.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.380 align:middle line:84%
We can feel energy flow
through our bodies.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Practitioners feel the energy
flow through our bodies.

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.652 align:middle line:90%
Not so easy to measure directly.

00:52:28.652 --> 00:52:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll never measure
it directly, and that's OK,

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.243 align:middle line:90%
but we can measure its effects.

00:52:32.243 --> 00:52:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Or maybe it's just that
technology hasn't caught up

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.020 align:middle line:90%
yet--

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: That's right.

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --to what is true.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:41.410 align:middle line:84%
At one point, the Earth was
flat until we recognized

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.100 align:middle line:90%
that there was something new--

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.410 align:middle line:90%
perceivable.

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And what if it's completely
there and absolutely

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:48.880 align:middle line:90%
measurable?

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.830 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
wake up on the level

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:53.690 align:middle line:84%
of developing the technology to
measure exactly such a thing.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Exactly.

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's making
me think of something

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that one of our
research directors,

00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:59.193 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Richard
Hammerschlage, says, which

00:52:59.193 --> 00:53:03.160 align:middle line:84%
is we were in the terms of
radio and then TV and Wi-Fi,

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
move toward the Bi-Fi.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that we have a
Bi-Fi detector, something

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.350 align:middle line:84%
that is able to measure the
shifts in our energy system

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and detect disease
before it manifests

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.010 align:middle line:90%
in the physical system.

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:17.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge game changer.

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.840 align:middle line:84%
That will not only
help people understand

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that we are bioelectromagnetic
beings and beyond, that we

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:27.610 align:middle line:84%
are vibrating beings,
but it will help medicine

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to understand,
how do we use this

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to foster health and
healing, prevent disease

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.440 align:middle line:90%
before it starts?

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked to-- everyone
wants this technology.

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.285 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:53:37.285 --> 00:53:38.680 align:middle line:90%
It is going to happen.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.060 align:middle line:90%
We have healers that want it.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.580 align:middle line:84%
They say, I want to be able
to show to my patients who

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.790 align:middle line:84%
don't see the energy field or
necessarily feel energy what's

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.860 align:middle line:84%
happening to them
in their bodies

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.500 align:middle line:84%
when they're getting
work done, right?

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: So imagine
how revolutionary

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.980 align:middle line:84%
this technology's going to be,
and we will work towards it.

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:54.938 align:middle line:90%
We are already working.

00:53:54.938 --> 00:53:56.950 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
great strides that

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:59.980 align:middle line:84%
have been made by folks
in Russia and other places

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.840 align:middle line:84%
to start developing
technology around this.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.570 align:middle line:84%
There is a tremendous amount of
research that needs to be done.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.690 align:middle line:84%
There's probably different
aspects of the biofield

00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:10.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to measure
that are going to tell us

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.562 align:middle line:84%
different things,
including sound, light,

00:54:12.562 --> 00:54:14.020 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of
different ways that we

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.890 align:middle line:84%
can measure the emanations
or the reflections

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.230 align:middle line:84%
of the emanations of the
subtle into the physical.

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:21.200 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And just because
we can't measure

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:28.930 align:middle line:84%
it yet doesn't mean that
it isn't not only there,

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:32.770 align:middle line:84%
but a completely valuable
thing for us to start

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:37.420 align:middle line:84%
to have a relationship
between this field of energy

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and the mind and its ability to
perceive it and work with it.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So in the meantime, while we're
waiting for technology to catch

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:50.440 align:middle line:84%
up to what we know
is possible, is true,

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.520 align:middle line:84%
what can our viewers
begin to sense

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and feel within themselves?

00:54:56.230 --> 00:55:00.970 align:middle line:84%
What kind of modality that
is inherent within our system

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:06.460 align:middle line:84%
might one be able to turn
their attention to utilize this

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.310 align:middle line:90%
to their advantage?

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Absolutely.

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:11.740 align:middle line:10%
So we rely on inner technologies
and our outer technologies

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.900 align:middle line:10%
just to reflect
the ability for us

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.370 align:middle line:10%
to engage in inner technologies.

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:10%
That's really what it is.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:21.130 align:middle line:10%
So we have such an
amazing plethora

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:26.070 align:middle line:10%
of practices to foster our own
healing from inner technology.

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And I suggest that people go
to what gravitates to you.

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Yoga is a complete system
of fostering healing

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:32.760 align:middle line:90%
inside and out.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Patanjali's Eight Limbs of
Yoga lays it out very clearly--

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:40.330 align:middle line:84%
so yam, which is the moral
code of ethics, Niyam,

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:43.710 align:middle line:84%
what are habits, Asana, which
are seats of awareness or how

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:46.170 align:middle line:84%
people think of yoga now
as just the practices,

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the physical postures,
which is one part of it--

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.820 align:middle line:84%
very important, but
not the only part--

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Pranayam, which is the
movement and awareness

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.333 align:middle line:84%
of vital energy, which so
many of us are teaching.

00:55:56.333 --> 00:55:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And the breath-- yes.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Pratyhara, which is
allowing ourselves to engage

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:05.460 align:middle line:84%
on the inner, explore the
inner planes, quiet ourselves--

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.760 align:middle line:84%
allow the mind to quiet
so that we can then engage

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.250 align:middle line:90%
in concentrated focus--

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Dharan, which can be
single pointedness

00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:15.960 align:middle line:84%
on a mantra or the
breath, for example,

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.300 align:middle line:84%
coming in and out of the
nose, many different ways.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So we go through all of these
different processes to then

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:28.260 align:middle line:84%
open to Dhyan or many-pointed
awareness, basically,

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.690 align:middle line:84%
the ability to really--
again, now you're really--

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:34.560 align:middle line:84%
the mind is in service to the
spirit because it's aware.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.057 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily narrowed
by the emotions or other things.

00:56:38.057 --> 00:56:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's not writing stories.

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:40.190 align:middle line:90%
It's available.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:43.210 align:middle line:84%
It's focused here
in this inner realm

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.460 align:middle line:84%
where healing
actually takes place.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: So we go
through all of this.

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And as the mind is
able to open to that,

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:52.650 align:middle line:84%
we then can experience
Samadhi states or states

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:54.360 align:middle line:90%
of unity and bliss, right?

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.310 align:middle line:10%
So yoga is a beautiful practice.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:57.900 align:middle line:10%
Qigong is another.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.040 align:middle line:10%
Meditation is another.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.410 align:middle line:10%
Many different forms--

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:02.580 align:middle line:10%
I've experienced many
different forms of meditation

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.433 align:middle line:10%
and found value in all of them.

00:57:04.433 --> 00:57:06.600 align:middle line:84%
It just really-- people
have to pick a practice that

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.460 align:middle line:90%
resonates with them.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But they all point back
toward, as you know, Sue,

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.920 align:middle line:84%
so well, cultivating
an inner awareness

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.850 align:middle line:84%
of the inner landscape and
grounding into the body

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:21.390 align:middle line:84%
is the single most important
practice that we can do today,

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:25.380 align:middle line:84%
however we do that, whether it's
through even exercise, movement

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:29.190 align:middle line:84%
in nature, getting into our root
chakra, getting into our legs,

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:30.780 align:middle line:90%
dancing.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.660 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
ways to get into the body.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: With joyful loving
presence in the meantime.

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Yes.

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Shamini, how can
people find you?

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Where can they learn more
about what you're sharing?

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Sure.

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:46.642 align:middle line:84%
Well, I invite people
to go to our website.

00:57:46.642 --> 00:57:49.380 align:middle line:10%
We have all kinds of wonderful
offerings all the time.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.290 align:middle line:10%
So we share the science, but
we also shared the practice.

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:54.492 align:middle line:84%
We have workshops with
healers and scientists

00:57:54.492 --> 00:57:56.700 align:middle line:84%
who come together to teach
what we know about healing

00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.920 align:middle line:90%
and foster healing in others.

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.320 align:middle line:10%
All that information can
be found on our website,

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.500 align:middle line:10%
which is www.chi--

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.690 align:middle line:10%
or chi-- .is.

So chi.is is our
nonprofit's website.

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:14.091 align:middle line:10%
You can also find me
on shaminijain.com,

00:58:14.091 --> 00:58:16.555 align:middle line:10%
and I'll share kind of all
of the different workshops

00:58:16.555 --> 00:58:18.180 align:middle line:10%
and things that I'm
doing on that site.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.097 align:middle line:84%
I'm also writing a book
for Sounds True, which

00:58:20.097 --> 00:58:24.450 align:middle line:84%
will be out in late 2020,
most likely, on the biofield

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and the healing revolution.

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.330 align:middle line:90%
So I look forward to sharing--

00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do you have a title for
that book that we can look for?

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: We're still
working on the title.

00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:32.310 align:middle line:90%
I like "The Healing Revolution.

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:33.893 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We'll have
you back on the show

00:58:33.893 --> 00:58:36.325 align:middle line:84%
when it's time for everyone
to know about that.

00:58:36.325 --> 00:58:37.125 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Great.

00:58:37.125 --> 00:58:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Shamini, you are
a brilliant, bright light

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.290 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for what you're

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.460 align:middle line:84%
doing, what your interest
is, and thank you

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:48.210 align:middle line:84%
for following your
childhood curiosities

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:52.530 align:middle line:84%
into an amazing, sophisticated,
intelligent approach

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to integrating humanity's
approach to healing

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.090 align:middle line:90%
back together again.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:00.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what it takes, and
you're a living example

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of exactly how we need to be
living our lives in this way.

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIN: Oh, thank you, Sue.

00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Thank you so
much for being here--

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:04.800 align:middle line:84%

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.620 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Yeah.

Dr. Shamini Jain
and CHI are changing

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:11.550 align:middle line:90%
the direction of medicine.

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:13.530 align:middle line:10%
This community of
scientists and healers

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.680 align:middle line:10%
seek to evolve how we
approach alternative medicine

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.330 align:middle line:10%
and healing practices.

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:19.740 align:middle line:10%
I am Dr. Sue Morter.

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
"Healing Matrix."
