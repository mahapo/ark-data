00:00:34.372 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: The most
common complaint about Western

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:10%
allopathic medicine is that it
doesn't take the whole person

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:10%
into account.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:10%
Rather, it views disease
as an isolated event

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:10%
to be treated in an
isolated fashion, which

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:10%
is why most diseases,
particularly

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:10%
those of a chronic
nature, persist.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Nita Desai chose
a different path.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Being of East Indian
descent, she was well aware

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of the value of Ayurveda,
and she pursued her degree

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:90%
in holistic medicine as well.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Desai learned
from the best of them

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and is going to give us a
primer on the value of using

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle line:84%
the Ayurveda principles of
opposites in our own health

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:90%
practices.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here today.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I know you're a busy lady, and
you're even between clients.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
We were lucky enough to catch
you here in Boulder, Colorado,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
because you are so clear
in your explanations

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:90%
of the subject of Ayurveda.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found anybody
that is as clear as you.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you really do embody
both the East and the West,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.009 align:middle line:84%
and you can speak
to all of us on it.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NITA DESAI: Thank you.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.716 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:32.634 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I
wanted to find out--

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:84%
you come from an East
Indian background,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:84%
but in your family
was Ayurveda thought

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
of as a different way of being?

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Not really.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:10%
Most Indian households,
we use Ayurveda

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:10%
as part of our lifestyle,
but we don't really

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:10%
think of it as being Ayurvedic.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:10%
So the food, the
cooking, the spices,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:10%
the combinations of
foods, all of that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:10%
is just part of the lifestyle.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:10%
The daily routines,
things that we

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:10%
do are very Ayurvedic
culturally but not really

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:10%
something that we acknowledge
as being Ayurveda,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:10%
for the most part.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you decided to
get your degree in Western

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yes.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.144 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And were you
having to, in your training--

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
first of all, give us an
idea about your background.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And also in your
Ayurveda training

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
you really trained with some
of the very best of them,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:90%
including Deepak Chopra.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
But did you have to give
something of yourself

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
away when you were going through
Western medical training?

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Well, I started out
as a Western medical doctor,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
so I guess that was my
framework when I started.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
more of a journey

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
for me learning
Western medicine,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:84%
becoming a Western-trained
medical doctor.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I was lucky enough
in my residency program

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
to have a medical
doctor who practiced

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Ayurveda who was a preceptor.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of had
a glimpse of there

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:84%
is something
different out there.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
way to practice.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
It gave me a little glimpse
that there's something else out

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
there, though at the
time I was obviously

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
set to be a family
practitioner, and I

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
was in a residency program, went
out and got a regular old job.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And once I started
working, I really

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:84%
realized that
close to 80% to 90%

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
of patients that were
coming to see me,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I really, really
couldn't help them.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have enough tools
or enough understanding

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.925 align:middle line:84%
to help people with
their everyday problems.

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.175 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Especially chronic
disease, I would assume.

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Especially
chronic diseases.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The remedies, the
drugs, the medications

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:90%
really were Band-Aids.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
They really weren't fixing
a lot of the issues.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I started to look

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:84%
a little deeper into other
ways of treating people.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did that pain you
a bit as a Western medical

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
doctor, to see you could just
keep throwing prescriptions

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:84%
at it, but the same people
would be back in a few months?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.922 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: It was difficult.

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
You want to think that
you're doing a good job,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and you want to have some sort
of satisfaction from your job,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:90%
no matter what you do.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And it just wasn't--
there was no satisfaction.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I wasn't
helping anybody.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a sense
of value in what

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I was doing at the
time for me personally.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I can
understand that.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a little off
topic, but I'm always

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:90%
curious about this.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:90%
What about your colleagues?

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So many people are still
playing in the system.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can understand
job security, economics,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:90%
and all those basic motivations.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But did many of your
colleagues feel the same way?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just say, hey, this is
what the HMO says to prescribe,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:90%
that's what we're doing?

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: I would say that the
majority of medical doctors are

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
beginning to realize there's
more out there and that they

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:90%
need to open up their horizons.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of them are being
forced, because their patients

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
are bringing in articles
and talking about things

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and sort of pushing
the issue a little bit.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say when I went
through medical school

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and when I went
through my residency,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
holistic medicine
really wasn't that big

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
of a thing at that time.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that I was
in the minority of people

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.936 align:middle line:84%
really looking at
something different.

00:05:05.936 --> 00:05:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you're seeing
a bit of a change now.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Absolutely.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's encouraging.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.308 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --a lot of younger
generation of physicians

00:05:12.308 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
already knows they have to
practice differently or else

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
they're just not going
to be successful.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I interviewed one
woman a number of years ago who

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
was a gastroenterologist,
and she had many clients from

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:90%
the age of five on.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And then she had the drug reps
coming through three, four,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
five reps a day, bringing
baskets of sandwiches

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and cookies for her
office workers and such.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And she had a thriving business.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But this one woman
came in regularly,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and she just kept getting
worse and worse and worse.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.567 align:middle line:90%
And finally, she disappeared.

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:84%
She didn't see the
client for a while.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And the client came
back about a year later.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.119 align:middle line:84%
She'd lost a tremendous amount
of weight, in a good way.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:90%
She didn't recognize her.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
She thought that they had
giving her the wrong file.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.029 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Oh, wow.

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so she looked at
the woman, and the woman said,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.837 align:middle line:84%
"I'm here for one reason, to
tell you you were killing me.

00:06:02.837 --> 00:06:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done--"
and she told her

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.466 align:middle line:90%
all the resources she had used.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the long and short
of that is the woman

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:84%
quit the business
after a short time

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and went into a
whole different way

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
of working with
people holistically,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:90%
like what you're talking about.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was a very
beautiful story and very

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.725 align:middle line:84%
courageous because that
was a big hit financially

00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:23.052 align:middle line:84%
to close the doors
of that business.

00:06:23.052 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: And that's what
it is for a lot of doctors.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe many doctors might want
to do something different,

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
but medical school doesn't
really train us in nutrition.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't train us in so
much of the basic tools

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
that we need to do a
more holistic practice.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:10%
And so it's a huge investment.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:10%
You come out already with
a medical education, which

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.290 align:middle line:10%
costs you a lot
of money, and then

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.027 align:middle line:10%
to do all this extra
training is very, very hard.

00:06:47.027 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But you did it.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.054 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yes, I did.

00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thankfully.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to do
was talk about this.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a weird system
of medicine passed down

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
through the ages for
nonsensical reasons and lore.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda makes sense
on a scientific level.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Give us some of
the basis for that.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Well,
basically Ayurveda,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the reason I became
interested in it,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is because it really explained
things in a very logical

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:90%
manner.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So many things that Western
medicine can't explain,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda was able to come
in and explain to me why

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
these symptoms were happening
in a very logical manner,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
in fact in a very
predictable manner.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So you could look at
somebody and almost predict

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
what their symptoms
were going to be.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So it really does have
a very scientific basis.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:90%
It believes in quantum physics.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.406 align:middle line:84%
So the science that
Ayurveda's coming out of

00:07:40.406 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:90%
is the new science.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It is the quantum
physics science.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:10%
We believe in energy in matter
and that there's a relationship

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:10%
there, and so we believe
that the energetic field

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.220 align:middle line:10%
around the body also
affects the physical body.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.430 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot of
research now in that field.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And we're really realizing that
it isn't just something way

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:10%
out there in left
field, that there's

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:10%
a lot of science behind it.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:10%
And Ayurveda kind of
follows in that footsteps

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:10%
of being a very ancient,
over 5,000 years old,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.700 align:middle line:10%
science, and that's
kind of why it's

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:10%
hung around for so many years.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.286 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Because it works.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: It works.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:10%
It's based on some
real scientific facts,

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:10%
and it definitely works.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, most people
who have maybe dabbled,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:10%
like myself, a little bit
with Ayurveda can understand

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:10%
the physical protocols of
opposites and so forth.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
acknowledging the quantum

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
field around the
body as well, you

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:84%
must be also including a
mental/emotional component

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.205 align:middle line:90%
in this practice.

00:08:43.205 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Absolutely.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda's a mind,
body, spirit medicine.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So we look at the
physical body, we

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:84%
look at people from a
mental/emotional point of view,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and we look at
them energetically.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I practice Ayurveda,
what I'm trying to do

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
is just like Western
medicine says

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have a unique
constitution at the time

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
of birth from your parents,
at the time of conception

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:84%
from your parents, you
inherited a unique constitution,

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine
calls it genetics,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
but then they don't
really do much with it.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
You're told you have a
unique genetic makeup,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
but then Western medicine
doesn't take that any further.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we look at you
from a physical point of view,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:84%
from a mental/emotional
point of view,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and from an energetic
point of view.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So we say that we really
need to figure out

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
what your energetic
signature is.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So at the time of conception
from your parents,

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.226 align:middle line:84%
you're born with an
energetic signature.

00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm
practicing Ayurveda,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I have to find out what that
energetic signature is, I've

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
got to find out what's
gone out of balance,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and then I've got to really
help you to bring that back

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:90%
into balance again.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.115 align:middle line:84%
And that's some of the basic
philosophy of Ayurveda.

00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And most of the time
when you do find a way to bring

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:84%
that back into
balance or harmony,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
is that when the chronic
diseases start reversing

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.714 align:middle line:90%
themselves?

00:09:54.714 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Pretty much.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of chronic diseases
from our point of view

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
is you've just kind of
gone off the path a little.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:84%
You've strayed
away from the kinds

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
of foods, the kinds of
lifestyle, the kinds of things

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
be doing to keep

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
your particular
constitution healthy.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:90%
So we're very individualized.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any one
prescription for everybody

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
because we believe in
this individuality.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of have to tap
into your individuality

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say, well, this
is what you should be doing,

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and then you'll be healthy.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a nice
little beginning point.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to get
into some specifics

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
because I think
most people watching

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:84%
this are looking to
hear and see and have

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
themselves reflected back.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems to
me the logical place

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to start is with the
constitutions themselves,

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.292 align:middle line:90%
called the doshas, right?

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Mm hmm.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And if we can start
out with the vata, pitta,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
kapha, with vata first, and give
us an idea of what this person

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
is like so we can start
seeing glimpses of ourselves,

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.910 align:middle line:90%
our loved ones, and such.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: OK.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So the doshas are
really energies

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that control certain aspects of
what's happening in our body.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So the first dosha is
called the vata dosha,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and it really controls
the nervous system

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:84%
or the electrical energy
system of the body.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.935 align:middle line:84%
People who are vata tend
to be very creative people.

00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be people who
have a lot of different things

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that interest
them, and they like

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to dabble in a lot
of different things.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:90%
They're open-minded, flexible.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
They can see lots of
different points of view.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
When the energy of vata,
though, goes out of balance,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
it'll start to scatter
in an outward direction.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, you
start to feel scattered.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:90%
You start to feel ungrounded.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So mentally,
emotionally, you might

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
start to feel a
little bit of anxiety,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:84%
fear, worry, those
types of emotions.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
You start to become what people
might call a space cadet.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
You might get a little
spacey, basically ungrounded.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So you have a hard
time focusing.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that's sort of the
mental/emotional component

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.182 align:middle line:90%
of what happens.

00:12:02.182 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So when they're in
balance, they're

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.856 align:middle line:90%
extraordinarily creative.

00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:84%
When they're out of
balance, they can kind of

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:90%
get into this ungrounded place.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Physically, we say
that that vata dosha

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:90%
is a very subtle energy.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:10%
And so the people physically
are these very light people.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:10%
They have light bone structure.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:10%
They're slim.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:10%
They're either very
large or very small.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:10%
They could be very
tall or very short.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Let's say a
Nordic type of constitution,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:10%
with blue eyes, blond hair,
thin, tall, more pale skin.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: That might be vata.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
most important part

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.299 align:middle line:90%
of that is the very small bones.

00:12:41.299 --> 00:12:42.465 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Small bones, yes.

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Very
delicate features.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Though vata has something
about irregularity.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Vata controls the
nervous system,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
so it's really involved
in movement and change.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And so anything that
moves, anything that change

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.719 align:middle line:90%
has to do with the vata dosha.

00:12:58.719 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
times vatas will have

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of irregularities.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Their face is not quite perfect.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
There's just a little
bit of irregularity,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.982 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
something not quite--

00:13:07.982 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not
totally symmetrical.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.273 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: --perfect.

00:13:10.273 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
In general, they tend to be
thinner, lighter physically,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:90%
weak joints.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So vatas will very
commonly get joint issues.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Digestively vatas tend to have
a harder time digesting food,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
so they tend to get constipated
very easily, gas, bloating,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
those types of issues, dryness,
dry skin, dryness in the colon.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Those are the kinds of issues
you would see with vata dosha.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In this profession,
among a lot of people who are

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:84%
writers and producers and
in this particular world,

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
not just as journalists
but entertainers as well,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:90%
you see a lot of vata energy.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Around here there's
a lot of vata energy.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I notice is going into
the vata mode with another vata

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is a very manic kind of
experience that is so fun.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:84%
It has to be why people who
suffer from manic depressive

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.106 align:middle line:84%
behavior don't want
to go on their meds.

00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Absolutely.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because you're
just flying with ideas,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:90%
rapid-fire creativity and such.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes I notice that
at the end of those sessions we

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
create, create, create,
it's so fun, but sometimes

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
not much comes of it.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: And
that's very common.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So vatas kind of dabble
in a lot of things,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
but they might not
finish anything.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: There's a hard time
getting to that finish line

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Also vata people are
very creative people.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to look at
stereotypical vata people,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
you might look at Vincent
van Gogh or someone

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
like that, extraordinarily
creative, very productive,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
but mentally just
had a very hard time

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
being in this world,
the material world,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:90%
taking care of himself.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And so vatas sometimes have a
hard time being grounded, just

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
taking care of
their daily needs.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you see
people exhibiting, say,

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:84%
manic depressive behavior, would
that be maybe more associated

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:90%
with one dosha or another?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Would that be maybe
more common among vatas?

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: It can be, definitely.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So anything that has to
do with the nervous system

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:90%
is controlled by vata.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's
rapidly changing is

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:90%
going to be controlled by vata.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So absolutely when you're going
up and down, up and down very

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
rapidly, that is a
vata type of condition.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: There might be
some other doshas involved.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And you have to remember that
everybody has all three doshas,

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
so we're a unique percentage
of all three doshas.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And so somebody might
have a lot of vata

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and less of the
other two or a lot

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
of pitta, which is
the second dosha,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of kapha, which is the
third and less of the others.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Or they might be dual doshic.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
They might have a lot of vata
and pitta at the same time.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of variation
within this where we're

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
going to simplify
today for people.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, yes.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Just keeping it simple.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yeah.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:06.953 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:16:06.953 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So then we need
to go on to pitta.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: So pitta people
tend to have a lot of heat

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
in their body.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Pitta is the biochemical
energy system of the body.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
neurotransmitters and hormones

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and enzymes.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
It's that biological
principle that

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
has to do with transformation,
assimilation, digestion.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do
with, in some degree,

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
our cellular intelligence, the
intelligence within the body.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So pitta people tend to
be very bright people.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:90%
They learn things very well.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:90%
They get things quickly.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:84%
They're organized,
get-things-done type of people.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
They can be very Type
A, goal-oriented people,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
go-getters, high achievers,
that kind of thing.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
When pitta goes
out of balance, it

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:84%
tends to get into
a situation of what

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
we call too much heat
in the body, what

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine might
call inflammation.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:84%
So pittas are very,
very likely to go

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
into inflammatory
types of diseases

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:90%
or infectious types of diseases.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.755 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A lot of the -itises.

00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: A lot of the
-itises, so sinusitus.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.299 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like colitis,
arthritis, all of them.

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:16.215 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: All of them.

00:17:16.215 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And those are all
basically inflammation-based.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Inflammation
or infection-based,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
a lot of inflammation and
infection-based based diseases.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Digestively, they tend
to be the ones that

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:84%
get the burning sensations,
the gastritis, heartburn,

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:84%
peptic ulcers, that
kind of thing, diarrhea.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.650 align:middle line:84%
They're more likely to get
diarrhea, burning diarrhea,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
bloody diarrhea,
that kind of thing,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:90%
where there's a lot of heat.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:84%
We would say energetically
that those types of issues

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of heat
involved in them.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Red things, rashes,
all kinds of hives

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and urticaria and red
rashy kinds of-- those

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
are very, very common
for pitta people.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So mentally/emotionally
when they're in balance,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:90%
pitta people are really bright.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:84%
They can learn
things very quickly.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:90%
They get things.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:90%
They can be really organized.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But when that heat starts
to build up in their system,

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.264 align:middle line:84%
mentally and emotionally they
go into anger and frustration--

00:18:15.264 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Impatience.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --irritability,
impatience.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:10%
So you would get that very
quick temper, short temper.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:10%
That would be a pitta person.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:10%
And then they have very
high goals and standards

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.116 align:middle line:10%
for themselves.

00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:10%
And when they don't meet
those goals and standards,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.212 align:middle line:10%
they get very self-judgmental
and self-critical.

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:10%
So they can be very hard
on themselves as well.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But does that
oftentimes when one becomes

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that way, then it's turned
out toward others as well?

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:40.263 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: It can be.

00:18:40.263 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:84%
If they're very good at doing
things and very organized,

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
then they can't understand
why everybody around them

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:84%
can't be as organized or can't
accomplish as much as they can.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And so then they can become
judgmental and critical,

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:84%
because they don't understand
that other people aren't

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:90%
the same as them.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Their minds don't
fire quite as rapidly.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So would there
often be mineral imbalances?

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about the
biochemical component and such,

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
would they tend to have
more issues with absorption

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
of various minerals that
would keep that more stable?

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Traditionally in
Ayurveda we don't go into that

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
level of detail with the
minerals and absorption.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Definitely digestively,
when they go out of balance,

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:90%
they have digestive issues.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
But traditionally,
Ayurveda wouldn't

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
go into that level of
detail of which minerals

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.992 align:middle line:84%
are pittas not
absorbing versus vatas.

00:19:34.992 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: That would
be a little too--

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:10%
looking a little too closely at
details that we don't focus on.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.756 align:middle line:10%
We focus more on the
energetic level, honestly.

00:19:43.756 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.463 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: So we really
believe that when you start

00:19:46.463 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:10%
to energetically
balance the body,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:10%
the physical kind of
comes back into sync.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:10%
And then nutritionally
it's quite possible just

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:10%
from the dietary guidelines
that Ayurveda recommends

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:10%
there might be certain
nutrients that are more common.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I was going to
say it's probably embedded

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:10%
in there--

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: It's
embedded in there.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --after thousands
of years of trial and error.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yes.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.574 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: I would say
it's embedded in there,

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:90%
but it's not obvious.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Anything else on the
physical constitution

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.570 align:middle line:84%
of pittas, what they might
appear like, for example?

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Pittas generally
tend to be people who are kind

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of right in the middle,
so medium build,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
medium bone structure, usually
don't have as many issues with

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:90%
their weight.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:84%
If they do have
weight issues, it

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:84%
tends to be more
around the middle,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:90%
right around the abdominal area.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.595 align:middle line:10%
So they'll have the
belly fat more likely.

00:20:35.595 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they can
have lighter skin,

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:10%
skin that's more
easily sunburned.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:10%
They can be redheads,
though that's not

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:10%
the only kind of pitta person.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But that's
almost a cliche, isn't it,

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.285 align:middle line:10%
a fiery redhead?

00:20:51.285 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Yeah.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But you say that
redheads often are more pitta.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Oftentimes
redheads are more pitta.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:10%
And that's probably
because of, historically

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.950 align:middle line:10%
and geographically, they
came from areas of the world

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:10%
where it was cooler,
and there must

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.399 align:middle line:10%
have been some
biological advantage

00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:10%
to have that extra
heat in your body.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: So there's probably
some geographic biological

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:10%
distribution of some
of these constitutions.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.190 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: But you can get people
of all three, vata, pitta,

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.309 align:middle line:10%
kapha, anywhere you go.

00:21:24.309 --> 00:21:26.183 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, that's
what I was wondering.

00:21:26.183 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:10%
Because I know
spending time in India,

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:10%
for example, it just felt
like a more kapha culture.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:10%
Now we'll get into
kapha, and then that

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:10%
will make more sense if
someone hasn't been to India.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I just had this feeling that
things were moving more slowly.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't as much of a hurry.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
There was more nurturing, more
color, taking time for things.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
kapha, and then you

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.765 align:middle line:84%
can tell me if that's just
because I was a tourist.

00:21:50.765 --> 00:21:51.306 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: OK.

00:21:51.306 --> 00:21:53.682 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It has no
bearing on reality.

00:21:53.682 --> 00:21:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Kapha people
tend to be a lot more--

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
they have a lot more of that
Earth energy or what we might

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:90%
call the Mother Earth energy.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
compassionate, caring people.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.610 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of love,
compassion, nurturing energy.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
They like to take
care of people.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
They also have a heavier
build, because they

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:90%
have more of that Earth energy.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to have
heavier bone structure.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:84%
They can be a little
bit more overweight.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We say that traditionally
we don't look at the weight

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:84%
the same way Western
medicine looks

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:84%
at weight, as an ideal
body weight for everybody.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
We say depending on
your constitution.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:34.099 align:middle line:84%
Kapha people might be
about 20 pounds overweight,

00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and that actually would
be normal for them.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
That would fit into
their constitution,

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:90%
and for them it would be normal.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
They can be the
kind of people that

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:90%
can easily build body mass.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of football
players are kapha,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.040 align:middle line:84%
because kaphas have a really
easy time when they weightlift

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
building up their muscles,
and they have good solid bone

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:10%
Kaphas have great endurance,
physical endurance, mental

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:10%
endurance, emotional endurance.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:04.600 align:middle line:10%
A lot of athletes are
kaphas, because the way

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:10%
they keep themselves in
balance is by the exercise,

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:10%
and they have that
great endurance.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:10%
They have strong
physical bodies,

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.625 align:middle line:10%
and so they're able to
actually become athletes.

00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little bit about
the physicality of kaphas.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Mentally/emotionally, when
kapha goes out of balance,

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.010 align:middle line:84%
it's more likely to go
into grief, sadness,

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:31.740 align:middle line:84%
some of the darker kind
of emotions, stagnation.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:84%
They might become
collectors, a little bit more

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:84%
attached to things,
couch potatoes.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Those types of things
you would see in kaphas.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of illnesses
you see in kaphas

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
are more of those illnesses
of stagnation, tumors,

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.489 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily cancer,
but tumors, growths--

00:23:50.489 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Growths.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.363 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --high cholesterol,
high blood pressure,

00:23:53.363 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:90%
gaining weight, mucousy things.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Little kids have a lot of
kapha, we say, in them.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
We say that during the childhood
years you have a lot of kapha

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
because you're building
physical mass on your body,

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:84%
so the kapha energy has to
be really high in your body.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So they get the little
runny nose and the mucousy--

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
You know you see the little
snotty-nosed kids running

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:84%
That's typical kapha
type of symptoms.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I have a friend
named Monica Dinzen.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Her parents were-- when
her father was still alive,

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
it was the most beautiful
thing, this nurturing,

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:90%
softer quality of the kaphas.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.754 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it
was the father who

00:24:31.754 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
was the more
nurturing of the two.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.461 align:middle line:84%
Every single night throughout
their entire married life

00:24:35.461 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
for 60 years, he always gave
her this lovely foot rub

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:84%
in the evening before
they went to bed.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was just one
of the sweetest bonding things.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But that, as you say, would
be more typical of a kapha.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: That would be kapha.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And so in Ayurveda we say that
one person in any relationship

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
should be kapha in order
for the relationship

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.279 align:middle line:90%
to be really special, nurturing.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you need
some of that loving,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:90%
compassionate, nurturing energy.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be the female person,

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.979 align:middle line:84%
but there has to be
a nurturing partner

00:25:06.979 --> 00:25:08.395 align:middle line:84%
for a really healthy
relationship.

00:25:08.395 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet this culture
does not really promote kapha

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:84%
behavior, kapha
physicality, kapha function.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.497 align:middle line:84%
The Western world
doesn't support kapha.

00:25:19.497 --> 00:25:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: It definitely doesn't.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't value some
of those talents,

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I would say, of
the kapha person.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you think of kapha,
think of your ideal image

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:84%
of a grandmother just nurturing
and caring and cooking for you,

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what makes life--

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --somebody
you'd want to--

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --beautiful.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.856 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: --hug.

00:25:35.856 --> 00:25:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Someone you can just
fall into their lap and fall

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:90%
asleep and feel comfort.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what kapha is about.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:90%
But we don't really value that.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.124 align:middle line:90%
We value pitta in this culture--

00:25:48.124 --> 00:25:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --really the Type
A, goal-oriented society.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But look what happens
in pitta-pitta relationships.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Very difficult,
high divorce rates.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: And so Ayurveda can
look at you from a physical

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:84%
health point of view, and
it can also look at you from

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
a mental/emotional
point of view,

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.170 align:middle line:84%
relationships point of view,
lifestyle point of view.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't have someone
really kapha in your life,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:84%
you might consider getting
a really kapha pet.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a good idea.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.425 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yeah.

00:26:15.425 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:84%
You might consider
getting very lovey-dovey

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:84%
beautiful big old dog
to take care of you.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yeah.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.057 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That can
be your huggy buddy.

00:26:26.057 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yes.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.848 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, now you
were talking a bit ago, too,

00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:31.425 align:middle line:84%
about in your practice you
see all kinds of people.

00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:32.925 align:middle line:84%
And we're here in
Boulder, Colorado,

00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:37.910 align:middle line:84%
which is very-- it's a very
health-oriented community, lots

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:42.180 align:middle line:84%
of physical fitness, lots of
raw dieting, lots of yoga,

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
a lot of very, very,
very thin people.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
when you have someone

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
who's essentially kapha that
is coming into your office

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and terrified of
gaining an ounce

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.787 align:middle line:84%
and this person has now
gone way out of balance?

00:26:54.787 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with that?

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Because now you're
dealing with societal--

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.610 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing
with self-judgment,

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:84%
self-hatred, a lot of things
an healthy Western society

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.022 align:middle line:90%
has inflicted upon itself.

00:27:05.022 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: And so that's why a
lot of people who come to see

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.335 align:middle line:84%
me are looking for
something different.

00:27:10.335 --> 00:27:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is
about giving people

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:84%
permission to eat the foods that
they really need to be eating.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:15.719 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: A lot of reassurance
that they're not going to gain

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:90%
excessive amounts of weight.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I really think it's
about the relationship

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that you start to
have with the person.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning, you have
to foster that relationship.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:90%
There has to be some trust.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the art of medicine.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And then when they start to
follow the guidelines, when

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.372 align:middle line:84%
they start to do the
little baby steps

00:27:38.372 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and try some of these
things out and they

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:84%
see that it's working for them
and they're feeling better,

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.031 align:middle line:84%
that's when they're
going to have more trust.

00:27:45.031 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to come back
and go, OK, well, that really

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:90%
worked for me.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're willing
to do more then.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:10%
And so it's little steps that
you have to take sometimes

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:10%
with people, especially
when culturally they're

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.524 align:middle line:10%
being given all
the wrong messages.

00:27:58.524 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be very
difficult also for vatas,

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.725 align:middle line:84%
who are essentially going out
of balance because of the way

00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
they're treating
their body, even

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.683 align:middle line:84%
though they think
it's very healthful.

00:28:08.683 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get to
that in a moment, the care

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.309 align:middle line:84%
and feeding manual
for these doshas.

00:28:13.309 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: OK.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.183 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But first I would
like to talk about the fact

00:28:16.183 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that you use some very classical
forms of diagnosis when people

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:90%
come into your office.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And so just so people can
kind of look in the mirror

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and get a glimpse of
themselves in this part

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation, let's talk
about the face and the nail

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.519 align:middle line:90%
and tongue diagnosis.

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: OK.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody
comes to see me,

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.890 align:middle line:84%
after their thorough
history-- I take a much more

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:84%
thorough history than most
medical doctors would--

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.420 align:middle line:90%
then I look at their faces.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda we have
face diagnosis,

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
so we can tell various
things from the face.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you just
one little small example.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will have
dark circles under their eyes,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.125 align:middle line:84%
and we say that that can
relate to the adrenal glands.

00:28:55.125 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:90%
It can relate to the vata dosha.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So what Western medicine
calls severe adrenal fatigue

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
we might call a vata
type of disorder.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So you might see
that with someone

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:90%
who has a vata type of disorder.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:90%
You might see really dry lips.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:84%
We see that a lot in Colorado,
where people have really,

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:90%
really dry, cracked lips.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And we say that kind of
reflects to the colon.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.749 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that person's
colon is really dry as well.

00:29:21.749 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, we can
tell a lot of things

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:90%
from looking at their face.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Then usually I move
on to their tongue.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:10%
You have an entire picture
of your intestinal--

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.030 align:middle line:10%
not just intestinal,
but your entire organ

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.792 align:middle line:10%
system on your tongue.

00:29:37.792 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Kind of like
the hands and the feet.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Mm hmm.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.196 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: It's like a little
map of the entire body reflected

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:10%
on the tongue.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:10%
So by looking at your tongue,
we can tell different things

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:10%
about different organ systems.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:90%
We can tell about toxins.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.420 align:middle line:84%
When we see people
having some sort

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.919 align:middle line:84%
of white discharge or
something on their tongue--

00:30:00.919 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Fuzzy white tongues.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --fuzzy white tongues,
we would say that those are

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:90%
toxins on the tongue.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.580 align:middle line:84%
We like to see a nice
clean, pink tongue.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So when people have either
white or sometimes you'll

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:84%
see a yellowish coating on
the tongue, all of those

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:90%
tend to be toxins.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there tend to be
more of one area than another,

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:84%
so we can even tell
where the toxins are.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:90%
We look at teeth marks.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.084 align:middle line:84%
We say that is a sign
of malabsorption.

00:30:27.084 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:90%
And there's actually--

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.916 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What do you
mean teeth marks, then?

00:30:29.916 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: So sometimes if
you take a look in the mirror

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and stick your tongue out,
you'll see that you have little

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:84%
teeth marks on the
sides of your tongue.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Little impressions.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.248 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Little impressions.

00:30:38.248 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And those are because, from
an Ayurvedic point of view,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.870 align:middle line:84%
we say you're just not
absorbing nutrients very well.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:84%
There's some
malabsorption going on.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:84%
From a Western point of view,
we know that those are rapidly

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:84%
dividing tissues, because
they're constantly

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.616 align:middle line:84%
getting irritated by your
teeth and eating and chewing

00:30:56.616 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and everything
that you're doing.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So those tissues on the
sides of your tongue

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.060 align:middle line:84%
have to be dividing
very, very rapidly.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't have
enough micronutrients--

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:84%
you might call those
minerals, vitamins,

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:84%
cofactors-- then you're not
going to be able to divide

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.237 align:middle line:84%
and keep up with that rapid rate
of cell division that you need.

00:31:17.237 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And so then you end up
with the teeth marks.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So from even a scientific
Western point of view,

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.470 align:middle line:84%
you can see why
that would happen.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who has
plenty of nutrients

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.930 align:middle line:84%
is not going to get the teeth
marks as easily as somebody

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't have enough
of those micronutrients.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now what about
some of the other factors,

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.900 align:middle line:84%
such as deep creases or-- what
is it called?-- geological--

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.780 align:middle line:90%
what is the name?

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: A geographic tongue.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Geographic
tongue, yes.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: So we say a geographic
tongue is a severe vata type

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:84%
of disorder, people who
have really deep-seated vata

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:90%
in their body.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It means
it looks like a map.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: It looks like a map.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So many crevices.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.065 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: They have lots
of crevices all over

00:31:50.065 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:90%
their tongues.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:10%
Some people will have
just a crevice down

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.130 align:middle line:10%
the middle of their
tongue, and sometimes it'll

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.290 align:middle line:10%
be more in the front
of their tongue.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:10%
And we say that correlates
more with the neck

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.390 align:middle line:10%
and the upper back.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:10%
And they might have neck
or upper back stress

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:10%
or tension or even pain.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it'll be more in
the middle of the tongue,

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.700 align:middle line:10%
and that correlates
to the mid-back.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.270 align:middle line:10%
Or it'll be in very
back of the tongue

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.170 align:middle line:10%
where they have a
very deep crease,

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:10%
and that usually
correlates to either a lot

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:10%
of stress and tension in
the lower back or some kind

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.452 align:middle line:10%
of physical lower back issue.

00:32:22.452 --> 00:32:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when it's
just creases all over,

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.285 align:middle line:84%
that mean just a
very dry condition,

00:32:26.285 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:90%
a very vata condition.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.697 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Very vata, yes.

00:32:28.697 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: The vata dosha has
been disturbed for a very long

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.900 align:middle line:84%
period of time in that
person and might be in some

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.126 align:middle line:90%
of the deeper tissue layers.

00:32:37.126 --> 00:32:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is
probably a no-brainer,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.099 align:middle line:84%
but when someone has a
swollen, fiery red tongue--

00:32:42.099 --> 00:32:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: That's going
to be a lot of heat.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: A lot of
heat in the body.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.553 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of pitta
that needs to be balanced out.

00:32:47.553 --> 00:32:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And finally, on that note,
I've seen some of the books

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.800 align:middle line:84%
on Chinese tongue diagnosis,
which are just shocking,

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
to think that, A, someone
might not notice some

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:84%
of these conditions
on their own tongue

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and, B, that you
could still be walking

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and breathing and living
with tongues that are black

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.550 align:middle line:84%
or excessively
deep golden colors

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.575 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the
tongue, for example.

00:33:08.575 --> 00:33:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
the question here.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It's so shocking.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
How do people show up-- Have you
seen some of these conditions?

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Well, I think a lot of
times in the West we're really

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.680 align:middle line:84%
not focused on our
own physical bodies,

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and so we don't have a lot
of body awareness or body

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.500 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And so many people in the
West can be walking around,

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and they really don't have any
sense of what their tongue even

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:84%
looks like because
we don't really

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:84%
think we can
self-diagnose ourselves.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't think we
can heal ourselves.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And Ayurveda's the
science of self-healing.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:90%
It's very empowering.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.654 align:middle line:90%
So we say, yes, you can.

00:33:47.654 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:90%
You can look at your tongue.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:90%
You can look at your face.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.220 align:middle line:84%
There's many things
you can look at.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually kind
of get an idea of as to

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:56.820 align:middle line:90%
what's going on your own body.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And then with a little
bit of guidance,

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
you can sort of
move yourself away

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.170 align:middle line:90%
from that to better health.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.369 align:middle line:90%
So I think some of it is just--

00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A lack of awareness.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --a lack
of awareness, yes.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.469 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now one thing women
are more aware of in this

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:10.844 align:middle line:84%
culture than men
are their nails.

00:34:10.844 --> 00:34:12.300 align:middle line:90%
And you do nail diagnosis.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: I do.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
part of it as well.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
of the chief factors

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that people might see,
like splitting nails

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:84%
or horizontal or
vertical types of ridges.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: So a lot of times
we'll see vertical ridges

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:90%
on people's nails.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:84%
That's very similar to the
little ridges on your tongue.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:84%
It tends to correlate with
malabsorption, just not

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:35.801 align:middle line:90%
absorbing nutrients very well.

00:34:35.801 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same thing.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:10%
You have the back of your nail.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:10%
You're rapidly dividing those
tissues to grow your nail.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:43.590 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't
have any nutrition,

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.139 align:middle line:10%
it's going to come out as a
vertical kind of a scar almost.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:10%
And so the more
vertical fissures--

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what you want
to call them-- we might say

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.760 align:middle line:10%
are from malabsorption.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.554 align:middle line:10%
When they're more horizontal--

00:34:58.554 --> 00:34:59.220 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Like the speed bumps.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --like
the speed bumps,

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:84%
then we would say
that's more metabolic.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.535 align:middle line:84%
Something's happening
with the person

00:35:05.535 --> 00:35:06.827 align:middle line:90%
from a metabolic point of view.

00:35:06.827 --> 00:35:09.035 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're seeing
a metabolic cycle, maybe,

00:35:09.035 --> 00:35:11.170 align:middle line:84%
where something happened,
something a little more

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.120 align:middle line:84%
traumatic may have happened,
and then it healed up.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.370 align:middle line:90%
But could it be, like, cyclical?

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:15.203 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: You might.

00:35:15.203 --> 00:35:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Or they're more
horizontal ridges, really.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
cyclical, or it could

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:84%
be something that's happening
right now metabolically

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.080 align:middle line:84%
where they're just not
able to keep up with it.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that
in their nails.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And really thin,
papery nails that just kind

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.529 align:middle line:90%
of peel?

00:35:30.529 --> 00:35:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: A lot of vata.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Lack of minerals, a lot of vata.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes we'll see
little spots, white spots

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.400 align:middle line:90%
on the nails.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And we say that is also a
mineral deficiency in the body.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And so again, going back
to that micronutrients

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.750 align:middle line:84%
needed for-- if you
hit your nail bed,

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:84%
you might scar that
nail bed, and you

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:84%
might have that little white
scar that slowly grows out.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And because you weren't
able to heal that,

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.510 align:middle line:84%
there's a good chance
the reason you wouldn't

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.968 align:middle line:84%
be able to heal
that is because you

00:36:01.968 --> 00:36:03.810 align:middle line:84%
didn't have enough
micronutrients.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we say when you have
a lot of those, most likely

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.050 align:middle line:84%
you're having some sort
of malabsorption problem

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and a mineral
deficiency of some sort.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:16.322 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that can happen,
I assume, to any of the doshas,

00:36:16.322 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:84%
where you can end up with
malabsorption issues.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So because this is
showing up in nails,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.860 align:middle line:84%
it'll be showing
up on the tongue.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.318 align:middle line:84%
What is one of the
first things you

00:36:23.318 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:84%
have people do if
they're not absorbing.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:29.502 align:middle line:84%
Is it a process of detoxing
before you can absorb?

00:36:29.502 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
Ayurvedic processes?

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Each person is so
unique that there's no one set

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.030 align:middle line:84%
way that I might
proceed with someone.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But really a lot of it has to
do with what are they eating.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people
are eating food

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.060 align:middle line:84%
that they just have
no ability to digest.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So depending on what's going
on, what their doshas are,

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.850 align:middle line:84%
we might start by
just putting them

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:84%
on a diet that is going
to suit their ability.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.702 align:middle line:84%
We say you should eat according
to your ability to digest.

00:36:57.702 --> 00:36:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Makes sense.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.743 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: If you have a
very weak digestive system

00:37:00.743 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:10%
and you've come to see me and
digestion's your main issue

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:10%
and your digestion
is incredibly weak,

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:10%
then we're going to put you
on an extremely easy to digest

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.640 align:middle line:10%
diet.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
really take the burden

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.730 align:middle line:84%
off the digestive
system, let it rest.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And we really believe that
the organs of digestion

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.180 align:middle line:84%
can regenerate and
heal themselves.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So we might use some herbs
and some herbal teas,

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.560 align:middle line:90%
things like that to help.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of what we
would do would be diet.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.140 align:middle line:84%
We might do some
lifestyle things.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And then there might
be some detoxification

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:90%
in there as well.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that gets
us to the doshas again,

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.839 align:middle line:84%
talking about how we feed
and care for our doshas--

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: OK.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.005 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and the
diet specifically.

00:37:42.005 --> 00:37:44.840 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: In Ayurveda we have a
concept that opposites balance.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So each of these doshas
have certain qualities.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.160 align:middle line:90%
For example, vata's very dry.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.070 align:middle line:90%
It's very rough.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Vata people tend
to be very cold.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.100 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of
heat energy in vata.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So vata tends to be
cold, dry, rough,

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.990 align:middle line:84%
some of these
types of qualities.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So the diet would be the
exact opposite of that.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:84%
We would actually say that
opposites would balance.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.610 align:middle line:90%
So for dry, we want moisture.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:19.400 align:middle line:10%
So a vata-pacifying diet is a
moist diet, a soupy, stewy kind

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.870 align:middle line:10%
of casserole-y diet.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.430 align:middle line:10%
We would put warmth in
there, because vatas

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:10%
have a lot of innate coldness.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:10%
So the diet would be warm,
warm with both warming spices

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.450 align:middle line:10%
but also warm energetically.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.799 align:middle line:10%
The food that you eat
would be soupy and hot.

00:38:33.799 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:10%
It wouldn't be-- you wouldn't
want to eat something right out

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:10%
of the refrigerator.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.630 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What about
things like salads?

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:41.920 align:middle line:10%
Because I see a lot of vata
people eating a lot of salads

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.050 align:middle line:10%
and then going to yoga.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.350 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: So we say that because
of the rough and dry quality

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.680 align:middle line:10%
of vata, most salads actually
have a quality to them that are

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.400 align:middle line:10%
rough and cold and dry.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:10%
The fiber in the vegetable
is very, very hard to digest.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.540 align:middle line:10%
So from an Ayurvedic point
of view and most Eastern

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.570 align:middle line:10%
medicines really do believe
that cooking vegetables is

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.610 align:middle line:10%
better for you.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:10%
So for vatas in particular,
we would do a more cooked food

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:10%
diet, including the vegetables.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And we would really cook
the vegetables quite well.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So vatas, it's recommended
that they eat more soupy,

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:90%
stewy kinds of foods.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You might even puree
it in the beginning

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.090 align:middle line:84%
if your digestion's really
weak, because the fiber is

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:28.016 align:middle line:84%
so hard to digest initially
when you have a weak digestive

00:39:28.016 --> 00:39:28.515 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:39:28.515 --> 00:39:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
The human body has some
trouble with cellulose

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:84%
anyway, breaking cellulose
down, unlike cows.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.501 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: We don't only do it.

00:39:34.501 --> 00:39:35.166 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: The organisms in our
body actually are what breaks

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.140 align:middle line:90%
cellulose down, but we don't.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.480 align:middle line:84%
What about proteins and vatas,
because of this creativity

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:90%
and airy quality?

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Vatas tend to be,
because they have a lot of this

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.970 align:middle line:84%
lightness in their body-- so
that was another quality I

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.130 align:middle line:90%
brought out earlier.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.591 align:middle line:90%
Vatas are very light.

00:39:55.591 --> 00:39:58.090 align:middle line:84%
They have light bone structures,
and they have this tendency

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to get ungrounded-- we want
to kind of ground them.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.140 align:middle line:90%
We want to pull them back down.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So heavy foods are
actually good for them.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So proteins would be
very good for them,

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.710 align:middle line:84%
because proteins have a
heavy quality to them.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So vatas do really, really well
with grounding, heavy foods,

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.740 align:middle line:90%
a bowl of oatmeal.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.210 align:middle line:84%
You might put a lot
of oil in the oatmeal.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:18.635 align:middle line:84%
So we might put
it big tablespoon

00:40:18.635 --> 00:40:20.310 align:middle line:90%
of ghee in the oatmeal.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.967 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, oils are
very, very grounding.

00:40:22.967 --> 00:40:23.550 align:middle line:90%
They're heavy.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:90%
They kind of help pull you down.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.095 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And for
those who don't know,

00:40:26.095 --> 00:40:27.220 align:middle line:90%
ghee is clarified butter.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Ghee is
clarified butter.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:29.157 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:29.157 --> 00:40:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yes.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.610 align:middle line:10%
Vatas, when their digestion's
good and they can actually

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.100 align:middle line:10%
digest, they would eat a
heavier kind of comfort food,

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:10%
oatmeal and casseroles and
things that actually you think

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:10%
of as comfort food, soft,
easy to digest, well-cooked,

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.947 align:middle line:10%
but with lots of protein
and a lot of oil--

00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:50.280 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: A lot of oil and fat.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:50.625 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: --and fats.

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:50.970 align:middle line:10%
Mm hmm.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:51.553 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:40:51.553 --> 00:40:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens when
vata goes out of balance?

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we all
read the headlines

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
of highly creative
individuals who

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.870 align:middle line:90%
are in rehab for the 10th time.

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
What is vata trying
to do when it's

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.750 align:middle line:90%
self-medicating with drugs?

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Well, we say from an
Ayurvedic point of view that

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.370 align:middle line:84%
when you are severely
out of balance,

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:84%
when that vata energy's
so out of balance,

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.360 align:middle line:84%
it almost takes on
a life of its own.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this tendency
to want to keep it alive.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So you then start
to crave things

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:26.252 align:middle line:84%
that continue to keep
you out of balance.

00:41:26.252 --> 00:41:28.335 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So like the
manic depressive behaviors,

00:41:28.335 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.519 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Exactly.

00:41:29.519 --> 00:41:31.700 align:middle line:84%
The manics want to
be even more manic.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So the vatas want to
have even more energy.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.420 align:middle line:84%
They want to be even
more ungrounded.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.170 align:middle line:84%
They want to be
even more speedier.

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So then they'll
drink a lot of coffee

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.110 align:middle line:90%
or have a lot of caffeine.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And they'll kind of
speed themselves up.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the vata takes on
a kind of life of its own,

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and it pushes you into a
lifestyle that's very unstable.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You could end up
doing coke and a lot of other

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.216 align:middle line:84%
kind of stimulating things
to keep the vata going.

00:41:54.216 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: To keep
the vata going.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Because vata does control
the nervous system.

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So when vata goes
out of balance,

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.270 align:middle line:84%
you end up in your
sympathetic nervous system.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.332 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain
thrill to being

00:42:04.332 --> 00:42:05.790 align:middle line:84%
in your sympathetic
nervous system.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
amusement parks.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.126 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:08.126 --> 00:42:09.059 align:middle line:90%
That's the gas pedal.

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: That's the gas pedal.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.610 align:middle line:10%
So keeping your foot
on the gas pedal,

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:16.010 align:middle line:10%
keeping that vata going, that
energy, it's very stimulating.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:10%
And some people, once that
vata goes out of balance,

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.070 align:middle line:10%
they just can't stop.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.724 align:middle line:10%
They want-- they
continue to want that,

00:42:22.724 --> 00:42:24.890 align:middle line:10%
and so they'll just keep
their foot on the gas pedal

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:27.190 align:middle line:10%
by whatever means
they need to use.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:30.020 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So coffee wouldn't
necessarily be indicated

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.635 align:middle line:10%
as the best morning
drink for dominant vata?

00:42:33.635 --> 00:42:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Not really.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.175 align:middle line:90%
Because vatas are so sensitive.

00:42:36.175 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:84%
They have very sensitive
nervous systems.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So anything that stimulates the
nervous system, that puts them

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.220 align:middle line:84%
into their sympathetic nervous
system, their kind of fight

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and flight nervous system
would be unbalancing to them.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.970 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: I tell people when
they're vata never leave

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:55.730 align:middle line:10%
the house without eating.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:59.240 align:middle line:10%
Or if you're in such a rush
that you can't do that,

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.701 align:middle line:10%
at least have a cup of warm
water before you leave.

00:43:02.701 --> 00:43:04.950 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I once had, when
I was doing a documentary,

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle line:10%
we were out on the road.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:84%
The crew was out on the road,
and my lead cameraman was vata.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The entire crew had to function
around his emotional and mental

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.810 align:middle line:90%
needs, which was exactly that.

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Come a certain time in the
afternoon, we had to stop.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.995 align:middle line:84%
He had to have his
muffin or whatever,

00:43:23.995 --> 00:43:26.004 align:middle line:84%
or we were going to
have a miserable day.

00:43:26.004 --> 00:43:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: And
that's part of vata.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.355 align:middle line:84%
Vatas need a very
regular lifestyle.

00:43:29.355 --> 00:43:31.860 align:middle line:84%
To keep that nervous
system in balance,

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:90%
you need your three meals a day.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.430 align:middle line:90%
You need your routine.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.020 align:middle line:84%
You need to wake up
at the same time,

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.430 align:middle line:90%
go to bed at the same time.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:39.471 align:middle line:84%
When you think about it,
what you're dealing with

00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is a person who has a very
sensitive nervous system.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So then we have to create
an artificial cushion

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.809 align:middle line:84%
around that person where
their routines, their rhythms,

00:43:49.809 --> 00:43:50.350 align:middle line:90%
their foods--

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:51.558 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Stability matters.

00:43:51.558 --> 00:43:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --a lot of stability
to give that person some

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:55.550 align:middle line:90%
grounded energy.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they might do
well in a more kapha-vata

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.205 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:43:59.205 --> 00:44:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: They might.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They might.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.318 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Where somebody
remembers to feed them

00:44:02.318 --> 00:44:03.069 align:middle line:90%
regularly, yes.

00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of
scientists and physicists

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:09.467 align:middle line:84%
who have lovely kapha wives,
which really grounds them.

00:44:09.467 --> 00:44:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yes.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now
let's talk about pitta.

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.805 align:middle line:84%
How do we care for and
feed a pitta vehicle?

00:44:14.805 --> 00:44:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: The main issue with
pitta is that amazing mind

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:21.110 align:middle line:84%
to that wants to just be so
Type A and goal-oriented.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.370 align:middle line:90%
But that overheats the body.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:23.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Or just the tendency
to want to overdo,

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:28.420 align:middle line:90%
so that overheats the body.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So pitta diets are more
energetically based,

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and they're more cooling,
and not as in iced cold food

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:37.140 align:middle line:90%
from the refrigerator.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.540 align:middle line:84%
But we say that food has
hot energy or cold energy.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So a chili pepper is
very spicy and hot,

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and a cucumber is very cool,
or aloe vera gel is very cool.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Actually, cow's milk is
very cooling in nature.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So we would put pitta people
on a cooling diet, foods

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.370 align:middle line:84%
that tend to cool
down the system.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So, in the middle of summer,
a watermelon smoothie

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.140 align:middle line:90%
would really cool you down.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
that we might

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.960 align:middle line:84%
consider giving
someone who's pitta.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Leafy greens, a lot of the
bitter leafy green vegetables

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.200 align:middle line:90%
are very, very cooling.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.840 align:middle line:84%
They can eat a little
bit of raw food.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.470 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of in between
the vata and the kapha.

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.990 align:middle line:84%
They're right in the middle,
so they can do a little raw.

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But in general, they
still want to do somewhat

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:90%
of a cooked diet.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.300 align:middle line:84%
We're not heavy on raw in
Ayurveda in all three doshas.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.099 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:29.099 --> 00:45:31.765 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: But the pittas can get
away with it a little bit more.

00:45:31.765 --> 00:45:33.492 align:middle line:84%
They can eat more
room temperature food.

00:45:33.492 --> 00:45:35.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to have all
their food hot and soupy.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that we
just never do in Ayurveda

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:42.750 align:middle line:90%
is ice cold food.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:84%
We never do iced drinks for
any of the three doshas.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're
overheated and pitta,

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.920 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't put
you on iced drinks.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.681 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.263 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: We use a lot of
spices that are cooling.

00:45:53.263 --> 00:45:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yogurt
is another good one.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Yogurt, if it's very
fresh can be very cooling.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:57.635 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:57.635 --> 00:45:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: We make
yogurt drinks--

00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I love them.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.203 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --that are called
lassis that can be very good

00:46:02.203 --> 00:46:05.010 align:middle line:84%
for pitta, if they have the
right spices in them that would

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.650 align:middle line:90%
be cooling spices.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.140 align:middle line:90%
So we use a lot of dill.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a cooling spice.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Cumin is very cooling.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Fennel is very cooling,
coriander or cilantro.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which really,
outside of the dill,

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:22.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those are in
certain chai recipes.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Some seem to be very hot.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Others seem to be
much more cooling.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I make a cooling--
everything you just said.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:31.770 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: And chai is basically
just a mix of spices that you

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:32.970 align:middle line:10%
put into your tea.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.500 align:middle line:10%
So you can definitely
make your own chai

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.370 align:middle line:10%
and just pick your
spices according

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:40.090 align:middle line:10%
to what you need for
your constitution.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:10%
So if you wanted a
more cooling chai,

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:10%
you could put more
cardamom in there.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.750 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.280 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: And if you wanted
a more fiery hot chai,

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.750 align:middle line:10%
you could put more black pepper
in there and get it really

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:51.490 align:middle line:10%
spicy.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:55.970 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So might chai
actually be a good morning

00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:01.390 align:middle line:10%
drink or approach to diet for
all of the doshas, really,

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:04.830 align:middle line:10%
because you can temper
those spice combinations?

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:06.630 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: I think chai
is a good approach.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.280 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't necessarily
have to have the black tea,

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.620 align:middle line:10%
because the caffeine might not
be appropriate for everybody.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.690 align:middle line:10%
But the idea of a
warm drink with spices

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.460 align:middle line:10%
appropriate for
your constitution

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.140 align:middle line:10%
would be a great
idea for anybody

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.980 align:middle line:10%
to kind of get themselves
going in the morning,

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.250 align:middle line:10%
wake up the digestive system.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:10%
Instead of throwing something
really heavy down there

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.280 align:middle line:10%
as the first thing you do,
putting some of those nice

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.696 align:middle line:10%
spice-- a tea that has
just some spices in it--

00:47:35.696 --> 00:47:37.070 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Without
the black tea.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:37.735 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Not necessarily.

00:47:37.735 --> 00:47:38.500 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Not necessarily.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.583 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Not necessarily.

00:47:39.583 --> 00:47:41.385 align:middle line:84%
Some people could
do the black tea.

00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It would be a good way to get
your day going, because it kind

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.860 align:middle line:84%
of gets your digestion
to wake up a little.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.755 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we'll get to how
people can find out about which

00:47:49.755 --> 00:47:52.255 align:middle line:84%
are appropriate for them toward
the end of our conversation.

00:47:52.255 --> 00:47:53.921 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to bring
that up because I

00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:55.800 align:middle line:84%
think it's a lovely
way to begin the day.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: It is a great
way to begin the day.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And so should we get back
to the pittas a little bit?

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Please.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: OK.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.410 align:middle line:84%
The pitta dosha, but mostly
it's just a very energetically

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.780 align:middle line:84%
cooling diet that
we give pittas.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the most
important thing

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.810 align:middle line:84%
for pittas really
lifestyle-wise is

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to not be Type A, to
not be so goal-oriented,

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:18.680 align:middle line:90%
to have some fun in their life.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.250 align:middle line:10%
So really when I
work with pittas,

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.270 align:middle line:10%
it's about finding
something that they

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:24.910 align:middle line:10%
find joyful that they
can be playful about.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.312 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of times they're
CEOs, and they're working hard,

00:48:28.312 --> 00:48:29.770 align:middle line:10%
and everything is
so goal-oriented.

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.110 align:middle line:10%
And then for their
recreation they're

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.520 align:middle line:10%
playing tennis or something.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:33.880 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Something aggressive.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.410 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Really aggressive.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:35.780 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Competitive.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.830 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: They're Type
A. They're on a team.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:40.070 align:middle line:10%
And I might steer them into
something a little more

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:42.364 align:middle line:10%
fun, a little more
playful, and maybe go--

00:48:42.364 --> 00:48:43.155 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Dancing?

00:48:43.155 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: --dance, yeah.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.110 align:middle line:10%
Do something fun and more
playful for exercise,

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.440 align:middle line:10%
just because they do need
a little of that balance

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.679 align:middle line:10%
in their life where they're
not so goal-oriented.

00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:54.220 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So what might be the
drug of choice for a very out

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:58.120 align:middle line:10%
of balance pitta that's
trying to perpetuate itself?

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.360 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Again, I think in
our society we do use a lot

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.330 align:middle line:10%
of caffeine.

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:04.945 align:middle line:10%
Anything that kind
of keeps you going

00:49:04.945 --> 00:49:06.070 align:middle line:10%
gives you high performance.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.150 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.150 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Because they just want
to keep going 20 hours a day.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to stop.

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So really the kind
of '80s, '90s cocaine thing was

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:84%
very pitta-oriented
in our society.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Very pitta-oriented.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Both vata and pitta tend
to be in our society a lot.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: One thing
I tell people,

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.525 align:middle line:84%
because I see this a lot, is
they'll get themselves going

00:49:27.525 --> 00:49:28.900 align:middle line:84%
in the morning
with the caffeine,

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.770 align:middle line:84%
they'll keep themselves going
all day with several cups

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of coffee, and then
because they're so wired,

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:37.250 align:middle line:84%
they've thrown themselves so
heavily into their sympathetic

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:40.852 align:middle line:84%
nervous system, when they get
home they can't turn it off.

00:49:40.852 --> 00:49:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: And so then they
have to drink alcohol to kind

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.915 align:middle line:84%
of depress their system
to bring them down.

00:49:46.915 --> 00:49:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: So they're in
this awful catch-22 where

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.530 align:middle line:84%
they're stimulating themselves
to get themselves going

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.870 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, and then
they're depressing themselves

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.030 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day to bring
themselves down so they can

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:90%
sleep.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:58.195 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: And it's part of
our society, unfortunately.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.270 align:middle line:84%
We end up in this
cycle, and it's

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.665 align:middle line:90%
very hard on the nervous system.

00:50:04.665 --> 00:50:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very hard.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard on the adrenals.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.870 align:middle line:90%
So now let's talk about kapha.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: OK.

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So kaphas actually have a
lot of that Earth energy,

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.110 align:middle line:90%
a lot of that grounded energy.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:17.010 align:middle line:84%
They tend to get all those
mucousy kinds of problems

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and overweight and
high cholesterol

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So they do better
with a lighter diet.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So kaphas actually can eat
raw food, if they want to.

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Not all kaphas, but if they have
a very good digestive system

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:32.690 align:middle line:84%
they do well with more
of a salad-y diet.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.975 align:middle line:84%
They could do a little more
raw foods, a lighter diet.

00:50:34.975 --> 00:50:36.266 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A lot of vegetables?

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Lots of
vegetables, lots of fruits,

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.370 align:middle line:90%
lighter on the carbohydrates.

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:43.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't do well with a
lot of cards, especially

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:45.430 align:middle line:90%
heavy things like wheat.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.680 align:middle line:10%
Wheat would be very
heavy for kapha.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.830 align:middle line:10%
A hot bowl of oatmeal would be
a little too heavy for kapha.

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:53.910 align:middle line:10%
They might start their day out
with a little something lighter

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:54.430 align:middle line:10%
than that.

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.650 align:middle line:84%
They might start out with
some just fruit salad

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.460 align:middle line:84%
in the morning or
something lighter.

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.050 align:middle line:84%
They do well with
protein, though.

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:05.820 align:middle line:84%
I think all three doshas to
some degree need some protein.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Kaphas can do protein.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.520 align:middle line:84%
But then if they do
too much protein--

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.720 align:middle line:84%
so if they're living in Texas
and having their 16-ounce

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.670 align:middle line:90%
steak--

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or their
52-ounce steak.

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --or their
52-ounce steak--

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.096 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's free,
if you can eat it.

00:51:18.096 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: --with the extra
large Idaho potato and a lot

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.169 align:middle line:84%
of butter, that would
not be a kapha diet.

00:51:23.169 --> 00:51:24.960 align:middle line:84%
That's where you're
getting your high blood

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.300 align:middle line:84%
pressure and your high
cholesterol, too heavy

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.802 align:middle line:90%
for kaphas.

00:51:28.802 --> 00:51:30.260 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
who really do need

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.514 align:middle line:84%
to eat more of a
salad-y type of diet.

00:51:32.514 --> 00:51:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Or if they don't
want to do salad,

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:37.010 align:middle line:84%
they can do more cooked
vegetables, a lighter diet,

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.807 align:middle line:84%
maybe some carbohydrate
content, but not too much.

00:51:40.807 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And when they go out of balance
into the depressive state,

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, which
you earlier said

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:52.410 align:middle line:84%
they might be prone to, how
do they tend to self-medicate?

00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Well, I think a lot
of people medicate by initially

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.260 align:middle line:84%
thinking that alcohol will help,
because alcohol initially gives

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.300 align:middle line:90%
you a little lift.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.970 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you don't care
about your problems anymore.

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:07.170 align:middle line:84%
But then it is
ultimately a depressant.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:08.705 align:middle line:90%
So alcohol can be an issue.

00:52:08.705 --> 00:52:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Again, we use so much caffeine.

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I think people who have
an issue with depression,

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:21.824 align:middle line:84%
many times they tend to
get hooked on alcohol

00:52:21.824 --> 00:52:23.740 align:middle line:84%
because it is a way to
escape that depression.

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.448 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:52:24.448 --> 00:52:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that
a lot of the people

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that I've known in the world,
the more intuitive world,

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, a lot
of the women that

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:37.020 align:middle line:84%
are known readers and
intuitives, and men too,

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:41.850 align:middle line:84%
who are needing to use that
kind of more subtle access

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:44.970 align:middle line:84%
to information, a lot of them
are overweight and sometimes

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:45.920 align:middle line:90%
quite overweight.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.960 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be a really
common theme that's

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.000 align:middle line:90%
even been written about.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.732 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Mm hmm.

00:52:50.732 --> 00:52:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why would that be?

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:53.007 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:52:53.007 --> 00:52:55.590 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: So we would say from
an Ayurvedic point of view that

00:52:55.590 --> 00:53:00.030 align:middle line:10%
the ability to tap into those
subtler realms and be intuitive

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:03.850 align:middle line:10%
has to do with having a lot
of vata in the body naturally.

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:09.320 align:middle line:10%
And so it's about the
opposites being in balance.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.340 align:middle line:10%
If you are tapping into
that vata energy a lot

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.800 align:middle line:10%
and using it a lot and needing
to go to those subtle places

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.410 align:middle line:10%
and you want to be healthy
and successful at doing it,

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:23.580 align:middle line:10%
then you have to naturally have
something that grounds you.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the physical body
has to be very grounded.

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And so one way to
ground a person

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:29.680 align:middle line:90%
is to put extra weight on them.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So naturally they
might gain weight

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:33.950 align:middle line:84%
to have some more
of that kapha energy

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.130 align:middle line:84%
to kind of anchor them in
their body a little more.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.588 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's just if you
have the real extreme in one

00:53:38.588 --> 00:53:41.750 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going to
be looking more toward--

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:44.370 align:middle line:84%
not looking towards, but
balancing it out by a little

00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.160 align:middle line:90%
more extreme in the other.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: In some sense, yes.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.367 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of intuitives
that aren't overweight.

00:53:50.367 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
who are very intuitive who

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:53.720 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of vata.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.930 align:middle line:10%
They don't have
that kapha component

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:58.040 align:middle line:10%
that helps to keep
them grounded.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.930 align:middle line:10%
And many of them may
not be very successful,

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:02.850 align:middle line:10%
because they do just get
so out of balance that they

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.270 align:middle line:10%
can't function in this world.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're
floating in the ethers.

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: They're floating
in the ethers, right.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think some of the
more successful people

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that we see, the reason they
are successful is because they

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.400 align:middle line:84%
do have some of
that kapha energy

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that helps to keep
them grounded and helps

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to keep them practical enough
that they can make something

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.264 align:middle line:90%
of their career.

00:54:21.264 --> 00:54:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now there's another
area that I want to ask you

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.460 align:middle line:84%
about, because I experienced
this in India at an Ayurvedic

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:30.860 align:middle line:84%
clinic, and that was shirodhara,
the use of oils internally

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and externally.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But the shirodhara
in particular,

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.060 align:middle line:84%
can you talk about the value
of that, besides being the most

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:84%
luxurious, wonderful thing I
think I've ever experienced?

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: We use a lot
of oils in Ayurveda.

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:48.280 align:middle line:84%
We say that oil has a very
kapha, loving, compassionate

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.220 align:middle line:90%
effect on the body.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:55.075 align:middle line:84%
So externally we use the oils
to ground the nervous system.

00:54:55.075 --> 00:54:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So in particularly when
we do the shirodhara,

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:02.170 align:middle line:84%
that's when we pour pretty
much body temperature oil

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:03.420 align:middle line:90%
onto the forehead.

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very,
very, very delicately

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:10.230 align:middle line:84%
poured onto your forehead,
so you almost don't even

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:12.170 align:middle line:90%
feel the oil being poured.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And as it coats the
scalp and the forehead--

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.024 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, you feel
it seeping into the hair.

00:55:17.024 --> 00:55:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Into your
hair and your scalp.

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It just really grounds
the nervous system.

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:25.640 align:middle line:10%
And most people will go into
a very deep either sleep state

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.980 align:middle line:10%
or meditative state.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.790 align:middle line:10%
So they'll go into that
parasympathetic nervous system

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:33.070 align:middle line:10%
and disappear for 20
minutes or something.

00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:36.140 align:middle line:10%
So it's very, very healing
for the nervous system.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.930 align:middle line:10%
We use oils mainly to ground
and balance the nervous system.

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.900 align:middle line:10%
We use oil on the skin
for the same reason.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.980 align:middle line:84%
We have so many nerve
receptors in our skin.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you take the oil
and you slap it on your skin

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and you rub it in, you're really
grounding those nerve endings.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And it helps to bring the
vata dosha back to its seat.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It also brings up
some toxins, I would think,

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:57.470 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: It does.

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.253 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a
mild detoxification.

00:55:59.253 --> 00:56:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: Your skin is
an oil, a lipid layer.

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.130 align:middle line:10%
So when you put
oil on oil, you'll

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:06.410 align:middle line:10%
have a little bit of the
fat-soluble toxins that

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:08.430 align:middle line:10%
will detox out into the oil.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:10.770 align:middle line:10%
And if you have an
herbalized oil that

00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:13.970 align:middle line:10%
has a lot of good herbs in it,
the herbs that are in the oil

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:18.210 align:middle line:10%
can kind of go in and diffuse
down into the bloodstream.

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:22.720 align:middle line:10%
So it's a great vehicle to
get some herbs into the body.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.310 align:middle line:10%
It's a mild detoxifier.

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And energetically,
it's really balancing

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.350 align:middle line:84%
in grounding in the body,
especially the nervous system.

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It sounds
like virtually everyone,

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.560 align:middle line:84%
certainly pittas and vatas
and everybody in this culture,

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.440 align:middle line:84%
which is just
pedal to the metal,

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.190 align:middle line:84%
could benefit from
the shirodhara.

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:42.917 align:middle line:90%
Are there any specific examples?

00:56:42.917 --> 00:56:44.250 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But are there any
specific examples

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.740 align:middle line:84%
where shirodhara has
been used therapeutically

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.250 align:middle line:84%
to help balance out the nervous
system, maybe sleep patterns?

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yeah.

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So I can give you an
example of a patient who

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.970 align:middle line:84%
had a real severe vata
type of a disorder.

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And we did the diet
and the lifestyle

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and herbs and so many
things, but we just

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.400 align:middle line:90%
couldn't fix her sleep patterns.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.540 align:middle line:90%
She still had severe insomnia.

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up doing
an Ayurvedic cleanse

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.300 align:middle line:84%
called panchakarma,
where she did do seven

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.440 align:middle line:84%
in a row of the
shirodhara, seven days

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.710 align:middle line:84%
in a row of having
the shirodhara.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And that really allows
the nervous system

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to come down and ground
itself very, very well.

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.530 align:middle line:10%
And at the end of
that detox, she

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:31.660 align:middle line:10%
was really able to
sleep very, very well.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.350 align:middle line:10%
It basically took
care of the insomnia.

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.360 align:middle line:10%
It never came back--

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.110 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: --to that
degree for her anymore.

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:36.870 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:39.332 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's just amazing
that it can be that effective,

00:57:39.332 --> 00:57:40.540 align:middle line:10%
that it has a lasting effect.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: It has a
lasting effect in the body

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:46.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's going in there
and sort of really removing

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the severe deep
vata in the body.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:53.030 align:middle line:84%
It's really allowing the nervous
system to rebalance itself.

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Really our nervous system
controls our whole body.

00:57:55.810 --> 00:58:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So it really-- we say
that 80% of all diseases

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:01.920 align:middle line:90%
have a vata origin.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
use so many oils,

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:08.220 align:middle line:84%
because oil helps to balance
the vata dosha, both internally

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.910 align:middle line:90%
and externally.

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about how people can--

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean not everybody
can come to see you.

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure most
people watching this

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.050 align:middle line:90%
would love to come see you.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.440 align:middle line:10%
But how can people
go about becoming

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.740 align:middle line:10%
familiar with their own needs
and their own dosha and such?

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.610 align:middle line:10%
I know there are
self tests out there.

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:28.630 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: There's a ton of
resources on the internet.

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:32.080 align:middle line:10%
I always tell my patients to
start with "Perfect Health"

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.030 align:middle line:10%
by Deepak Chopra.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.520 align:middle line:10%
I still think that is a
very great beginner book.

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.369 align:middle line:10%
It does have some
little quizzes in there,

00:58:38.369 --> 00:58:40.160 align:middle line:10%
and you can take the
quizzes and figure out

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.700 align:middle line:10%
what your constitution is.

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.760 align:middle line:10%
I tell people when
they first take

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.910 align:middle line:10%
the quiz think of
how you were when

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:47.930 align:middle line:10%
you were the healthiest
in your life, probably

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:50.760 align:middle line:10%
when you were younger,
and fill it out that way.

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And then think how you are now,
and then fill it out again.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, you might
be able to get a clue as

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to what you constitution
is-- that's your younger,

00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:02.510 align:middle line:84%
healthier self-- and then
your current imbalance.

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able
to kind of clue in.

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes people clue
in just to their imbalance

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:09.286 align:middle line:84%
and not to what their
constitution is.

00:59:09.286 --> 00:59:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>> DESAI: Yeah.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.834 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that will also
give us an opportunity then

00:59:13.834 --> 00:59:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to see which kinds of herbs
and spices and foods and sleep

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.575 align:middle line:84%
patterns and exercise
patterns. "Perfect Health"

00:59:19.575 --> 00:59:20.700 align:middle line:90%
kind of gets into all that?

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> DESAI: It gets
into all of that.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.053 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:59:22.053 --> 00:59:26.090 align:middle line:10%
>> DESAI: Another great book
is Dr. Vasant Lad, L-A-D.

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.960 align:middle line:10%
He has an Institute in
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.300 align:middle line:10%
and he's written a lot
of books on Ayurveda.

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.630 align:middle line:10%
And so any of his
books. "Ayurveda,

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:37.290 align:middle line:10%
the Science of Self-Healing"
is a good book.

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:39.550 align:middle line:10%
He's written a
home remedies book.

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you have allergies,
you can look up

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:42.892 align:middle line:90%
what to do for allergies.

00:59:42.892 --> 00:59:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
good books out there.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.724 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, very good.

00:59:45.724 --> 00:59:47.950 align:middle line:84%
