>>SOWAH: Well, I
was born in Ghana.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And I lived and studied
in Ghana till I was older,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
before I moved to
the United States

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:90%

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in a small town

Accra is a metropolitan
city, the capital.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And my lifestyle, my daily
occupation, what I did mostly

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:84%
had to do with going to school,
play, and helping with chores.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I grew up as a
typical African who

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
participated in the
daily life of the home,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
besides going to
school and playing.

grew up very shy.

>>SOWAH: I remember, as a
kid, I was not one to be seen.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I would mostly lay
back in most contexts.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:10%
And for example,
when I was in school,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:10%
if my teacher sent me to
get a chalk or a duster

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:10%
out from another class, the
idea of entering another class

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:10%
with all the kids seated and
me speaking with a teacher

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:10%
was too much for me.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.445 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Overwhelming.

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:38.237 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: Instead of
going to another class,

00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather go home.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I get it.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So I ditched
school instead

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:90%
of going to another class.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Just didn't want to be
seen-- just retreat, reserved.

>>SOWAH: Yup, mm-hmm.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I was young,
if I went to church I would not

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
walk through the church to
sit where the usher wanted

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
me to sit.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I would sit where I would
have the least exposure.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And if that meant standing
in the back, that was fine.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.902 align:middle line:90%
I would not be found walking--

00:03:07.902 --> 00:03:08.735 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I understand.

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This is my
story as a kid.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yeah.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Didn't want to be seen.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So I was
that shy, yeah.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So, shy, don't
want to be seen,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.325 align:middle line:84%
and yet you chose to become
a dancer and then a teacher.

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:30.705 align:middle line:84%
So can you give us the path
that unfolded that way?

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: Well, I
never imagined I would

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:90%
be a dance teacher as a kid.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I never even imagined
being a dancer

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
because I remember,
as a child, I

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:84%
was not open to doing recitals
in church or in school.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But I was always open to
dancing, open to singing.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:90%
So I was in the school choir.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And if there was a play,
I'll be the dancer.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But talking was not
part of my thing.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And I never imagined
becoming a dancer.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
One thing I learned early was
that any time I was involved

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:90%
in dancing, I felt freer.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.278 align:middle line:84%
My shyness and
inhibitions went down.

00:04:20.278 --> 00:04:21.695 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Would go
away-- would melt.

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So that was the
signal for me at an early age,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that when I danced,
it empowered me.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yeah.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And this is ultimately
what we all have to find,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is how do we feel that
sense of empowerment.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
If we're ever going
to find our wholeness,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to heal or to be thriving in
expressing ourselves fully,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:90%
we have to find our way.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And I find-- I've been 30
years in clinical research

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and clinical practice
and working with people

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
in healing--

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.080 align:middle line:84%
that when people
can feel themselves

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:90%
in the body, things change.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to
digging into our conversation

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:90%
in this way.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.745 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Sure.

00:04:57.745 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, first
let's just say this.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%

you came to the US

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:90%

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: 33.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yeah.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:90%
33.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Came to the US, moved
into a community

>>SOWAH: --with not much on me--

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
lost all my luggage
and had my hand luggage

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:90%
with $80 in my pocket.

the next few weeks,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
my experiences socially in
the streets of Cambridge,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Massachusetts, transformed me.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know before
coming here that it

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:90%
mattered that I was black.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know that a person's
value had to do with--

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:10%


00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Anything.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: And before coming
here, I was an actor.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I was a teacher at
that university.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:90%
So I had some self-dignity--

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:90%
a sense of dignity.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But arriving and having people
get up when I sat on the train,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.768 align:middle line:84%
or feeling lost in the
winter in the Harvard Square

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get
direction and people just

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
walking away from me,
and feeling so alone

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:84%
was the most traumatic thing
I ever experienced in my life.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.812 align:middle line:84%
And I never imagined
it was possible.

00:06:56.812 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you turned inward
then, thinking, separation--

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
there's something
different here--

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
maybe not knowing
you had medicine

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
to bring to a culture that
would behave in such a way.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.493 align:middle line:10%
In those initial moments, we
tend to respond differently.

00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: I think
in the beginning,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
questions and wondered

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
why people would tell me
to call them to have coffee

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:90%
if they didn't mean it.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when somebody said, oh,
let's talk, let's make a date,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I would follow through.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Where you came
from, they meant it.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yeah.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.435 align:middle line:90%
And so I would call people.

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I would hear
is, I don't know what he wants.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:90%
He keeps calling me.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought we had a deal,
I was supposed to call you.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So after a while, I've
realized that it was not

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:90%
meant like that.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:90%
It was just talk.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You mentioned that
several people in the community

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that you arrived in and started
to establish this new life

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:90%
within were in therapy.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Oh.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in graduate school
for expressive arts therapies.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I went to Lesley
University in Cambridge.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in a program
with students studying

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
counseling and
psychology, students

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
studying dance therapy,
art therapy, music therapy,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:90%
psychodrama.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:10%
And I came in as an expressive
arts therapy student

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:10%
with emphasis on dance therapy.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And as the semester went
by, I learned quickly

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that the concepts and the
philosophies that the program

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:84%
were founded on were not
aligned with my background

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
dance therapy was

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
or what psychological
models we were using--

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
were not aligned to
where I was coming from.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So I started questioning
how much of this education

00:08:51.740 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:84%
to embrace, how much of this
program to get buried in.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So I started questioning things
and making choices carefully so

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't lose my identity.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I came in.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, I started
a program on the campus.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It was a Friday
evening thing that I

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.390 align:middle line:84%
offered to the community--
the whole campus--

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:90%
students, faculty, staff.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And I did that for a couple
of years, Friday evenings.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And people would come, and we
would dance, we would drum,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
we would sing, some
massage, chat, also sorts

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:90%
of just human activities.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
from that, from talking

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
to my participants
and my peers was

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that even though most
of them were therapists,

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
they were therapists
in training.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
They found that
coming to my event

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:84%
was more healing, more
fulfilling, more empowering.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't
have that, they

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:90%
would be losing their minds.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.262 align:middle line:84%
Because they went in as
therapists to help people,

00:10:17.262 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:84%
but they realized
they, themselves,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.927 align:middle line:90%
needed a lot of help.

00:10:19.927 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Were drawn
to the things that--

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: And they found
what I did very powerful.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I
didn't have any set ideas

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:90%
of exactly what I was doing.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:84%
But I was just drawing
from my background

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and a little from my training
and piecing it together.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, you were discovering
your true soul's calling,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:90%
your true path.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yeah.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And it's
rarely shown to us.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
We have to kind of weave
it together and pull

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:84%
from various experiences
and educational aspects

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and components.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And we're the weaver.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And this, you know.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
touch on something

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned
earlier about depression,

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.558 align:middle line:84%
that while you're working
with these therapists

00:11:06.558 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and therapists-to-be, and
they're coming to your dance,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and things are unfolding
and blossoming for them,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned something
special about depression

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and how it wasn't present
for you, until it was.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: Well, I
didn't know what

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:84%
depression was
growing up, because I

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:90%
hadn't seen anybody depressed.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, this is amazing.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: In my community, I
hadn't seen anybody depressed.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think the first time I
heard about "nervous breakdown"

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.782 align:middle line:84%
was in 1990 when I
went for a training

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:90%
outside of the country.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what was
that "nervous breakdown"?

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is a
"nervous breakdown"?

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So they had
to explain it to me.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And I bet anyone who is
educated in psychology

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:90%
would know these things.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But coming from my
background, I didn't

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
know anybody whose condition
was such that they would--

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Would call
it depression-- why?

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:90%
What do you attribute that to?

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: I think I grew up
in a communal environment,

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:90%
where we lived together.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a small house
with my mother and sisters

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and all their children and other
extended family and other house

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:90%
help.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:90%
We all lived in the small house.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:10%
And we played together,
we worked together,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:10%
we stood up for each other,
we looked out for each other

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:10%
in our home.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
But we will also
belong to the larger

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:90%
community of other families.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And we played.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
We would go away 10 miles,
8 miles away from home.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'm talking 10 years old.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
We just were alive, playing,
making our own toys,

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.440 align:middle line:84%
imagining games and connecting
with each other, fighting,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.527 align:middle line:84%
and all these natural
things children--

00:13:02.527 --> 00:13:04.485 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Just a real raw
expression and exchange.

00:13:04.485 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:90%
We were raw.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: And one thing I found
in the years after was that

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:84%
those were some of the
best times of my life--

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:84%
the challenge, the nurturing,
that sense of belonging--

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
actually, where the foundations
of who I have become.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Subsequently, we moved
from that environment

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to another area that was more
comfortable, with more rooms

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:90%
and bathrooms and everything.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And that environment
also offered me some.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that all of
these living environments

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
contributed to my formation
in terms of who I have become.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it wasn't
that you didn't

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:90%
experience challenging things.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was that your way of
processing the challenging

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
things that you were
experiencing was more communal.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.915 align:middle line:84%
You weren't an
isolated, separate self.

00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:07.915 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You were
networked and connected

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
into a larger body
of consciousness

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
or a larger body of people
that were in this collective.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:84%
This is what the healing
matrix is all about,

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.763 align:middle line:84%
that we are wanting people
to realize they're not

00:14:21.763 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:90%
a separate individual.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And to be present with
whatever they're experiencing

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:90%
is the healer awakening.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you mentioned
that you've seen things

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that were challenging, that
by the standards in the US,

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:84%
for instance, you could have
been in a psych ward yourself.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: [LAUGHS]

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:90%
But, no.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:90%
You've unfolded differently.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Can you just share about that?

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: I was in grad school.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.710 align:middle line:90%
And they'll talk about trauma.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:84%
They'll talk about things
like bullying or name-calling.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
they talked about.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And apparently name-calling
can be damaging to a person,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:90%
irreparably.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
if this was true,

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
then most of my
buddies from childhood

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:90%
should be totally destroyed.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think how we
experience life has

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:90%
something to do with culture.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Our expectations or
how we receive feedback

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
or experiences, it's not
isolated from a culture.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So within a certain
culture, a person

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:84%
may be irreparably damaged
from name-calling or bullying

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:90%
of any sort.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:90%
But for us, it was a raw world.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it
builds character.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:90%
It builds strength, resilience.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, when you
balance it with knowing

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
that you belong and there's
a sense of nurturance that

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
comes from your community,
it is a holistic environment

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
where challenge is just
one part of the whole.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:16.020 align:middle line:84%

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and to rise to that
creative tension,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
if we're in a healthy

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:90%

>>SOWAH: I'd like to
speak of it this way.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I see all the
challenges that we face,

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.670 align:middle line:90%
we could see them in two ways.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:84%
One way is see their
challenges as stumbling blocks.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But we can also see the same
challenges as stepping stones.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And how we see these
challenges depends

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
on our backgrounds, what
we believe about ourselves,

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:90%
what environment we live in.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like a world
without challenges

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.900 align:middle line:90%
would not be worth living.

awaken through it, rather

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:90%
than being beaten down by it.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, you are an educated man.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:84%
What kind of research
were you being

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:90%
provided in your education?

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: At the time, I
realized there was a lot going

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
on regarding various
psychological models--

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Freudian or humanistic
and all that energy work

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:90%
and different modalities.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And, again, one thing
I noticed at the time

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
was that most of these
psychological models

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
were designed for fixing
problems, for healing.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
But then I was looking at
things from the perspective

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
of my own experience
that the more I played,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
the more I danced, the more
I felt connected to people.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
To that extent, I felt strength.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.368 align:middle line:90%
And so this is one way I put it.

00:18:45.368 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:84%
A person is at their best
when they've felt at home.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you
feel at home, you

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:90%
are free to express yourself.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:90%
You are free to imagine.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:90%
You are free to create.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:84%
You are free to be your
full, authentic self.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm coming to this whole
realm of psychology and therapy

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:84%
from a background
that emphasized

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:90%
a sense of belonging.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Now that, put against
these psychological models,

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:90%
sometimes seemed disparate.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what I was looking
at was, what can I

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.410 align:middle line:90%
make of where I have come from?

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Is there value to how I grew up?

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Is there value to
my cultural ideals?

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Is there value to the
cultural norms I grew up with?

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the question I asked
was, if singing and dancing made

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
me feel at home,
how could we tap

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:90%
into that sense of comfort--

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.110 align:middle line:84%
feeling comfortable
and in my element--

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:84%
as a foundation for
facilitating human well-being.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I came into it.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So I was not particularly
interested in the ideas

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:90%
regarding past lives or rebirth.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I'm sure there is
validity and legitimacy to all

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.930 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:90%

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I am looking to reinvent
what I have known.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking to enhance
what I have known.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking to pushing the
edges of the evolution of what

I know.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at
dance from a perspective

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:90%
that is cultural to me.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%

noticed early that I

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.395 align:middle line:84%
couldn't fulfill all
the requirements to be

00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:90%
a licensed therapist.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't want to be that.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I realized my calling was more
for facilitating environments

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
where folks can dance,
can sing, can play,

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:90%
can connect with each other.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I
had an advantage,

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:84%
being that I could drum, I
could sing, I could dance,

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.290 align:middle line:90%
I could tell stories.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And if I could pull
all of these together,

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:90%
I could create a model--

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:84%
a contemporary model--
that brings forth

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:84%
the best from my culture,
coupled with other ideas

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and stuff I have
learned along the way.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So I began to look at, how can
we do this traditional dance

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:84%
in a way that actually makes
a difference in the lives

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:90%
of the people in front of me?

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this
traditional dance,

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.360 align:middle line:84%
are there certain
movements-- because it's

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:90%
so beautiful to watch.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:90%
It's so vital and alive.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Is each movement a
piece of language?

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Or is it organically
unfolding as a person

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:84%
is expressing themselves in
an uninhibited, unplanned sort

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:90%
of way?

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:90%
What's happening here?

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: Well, first of
all, Africa is made up

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.710 align:middle line:90%
of over 54 countries.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And each country has
many ethnic groups.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And each of these groups have
their own sets of dances.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
These dances may be
social, recreational,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:90%
they may be religious.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
They may be occupational,
meaning folks

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:84%
in various occupations,
like fishermen

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:84%
or hunters or blacksmiths will
have dances that they did.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But there'll be also dances
for worship and all sorts.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, given, for
example, that Ghana

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:84%
has over 60 different
languages, you

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:84%
can imagine the number of dances
that come out of Ghana alone.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So within each particular
group, the dances they do

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
may reflect something
about their history.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
The dances they do
may reflect something

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:90%
about the ideals and values.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The dances they do
may reflect something

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:84%
about their environment
that they live in.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So they're
telling a story.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yep.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just
expression of joy.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's an
expression of sadness,

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:84%
because if you go to a funeral
and there's a funeral dance,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:84%
that dance fulfills
the aims and objectives

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:90%
of the particular occasion.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, that given, in spite of the
diversity of cultures and dance

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:90%
styles--

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:84%
which means some
dances are softer,

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:84%
some are more jump-oriented,
and some are more based

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:90%
on the trunk or the torso--

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:84%
now, in spite of that,
as Africans-- and I

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:84%
will speak specifically
to sub-Saharan Africa,

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:84%
we, have what we call
"shared aesthetics"

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
or shared sensibilities
in our dances.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So our dances tend
to be earthbound.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.932 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm, grounding.

00:28:06.932 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: Our movements
tend to be polycentric.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It means different parts of
the body doing different things

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.690 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Independently, mm-hmm.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: It means
we tend to dance

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:84%
in a circle with the center
being the dance floor.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.840 align:middle line:84%
It means that audiences
participate with the dancers

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:84%
by clapping or cheering
as the dance is going on.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.830 align:middle line:84%
There are several things that
are called commonalities.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And those are the things that
we can name as "African dance."

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But that does not negate
the differences in style.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So in my work, I may draw
a specific dance from, say,

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:84%
the Guang people of Ghana, or
I may draw a specific dance

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.710 align:middle line:84%
from the Ewe people
of Ghana as an example

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:84%
to address the larger
aesthetic of African dance.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So while teaching
about African culture,

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:84%
we are also looking at how
the students can become

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:84%
the subjects or the
bodies that would

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:84%
emulate their African values
that give birth to the dance.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So then we have to
create a community.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And as a community, we
have to work together.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is where it
goes to the personal.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So my work is
cultural, is community,

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.988 align:middle line:90%
and is personal growth.

00:29:31.988 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And therapeutic
because of all that.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And personal means
engaging with the community

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:90%
for the common good.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is the beginning
of self-awareness

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that's the beginning of
understanding one's place

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:90%
within--

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Who I am in the world.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Who am I?

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Who I am--

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: in the universe?

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --in the world?

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So the dance circle
or the context of the class

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:90%
becomes, I call it, text.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are
literate, you can

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:08.190 align:middle line:84%
read a lot of concepts
and philosophies

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:90%
in the dance class.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:84%
As people are dancing,
certain dynamics speak.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about stepping stone
or stumble stumbling blocks.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:84%
You see somebody who
is about to give up--

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.405 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Uh-huh.

00:30:22.405 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Move.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:23.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: How do we
name the options here?

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:84%
You can give up or
you can step up.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So using the dance and the
songs and the relationships

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:84%
as a context for drawing
awareness to the opportunity we

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:45.703 align:middle line:84%
That is where the
work becomes relevant.

00:30:45.703 --> 00:30:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So even though we are talking
about African culture,

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:53.760 align:middle line:84%
we realize that it also speaks
to our actions and interactions

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:90%
in the context.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And to everyone, in
real time, interculturally.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Even if they've
never stepped foot in Africa

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
heritage there,

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.680 align:middle line:90%
everyone benefits from this.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So tell me what happens
in the mind field.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I work with bioenergetics
and how the energy

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.060 align:middle line:90%
flows through our body.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And the objective is
to keep the energy

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
moving through our body in
order for health and wholeness

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and healing to be possible.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And so as you're getting
people to move and to engage,

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:84%
can you just say a little bit
about what happens emotionally,

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
what happens to the physical
body, the emotional body,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.450 align:middle line:84%
the mind field, all collectively
when someone engages

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:90%
in what you're stewarding here?

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: That's a good question.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it's common knowledge
that physical activity does

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot to enhance our well-being
in terms of releasing

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:90%
certain chemicals in our body.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And we feel good when
we do physical activity.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that I say is this.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:02.470 align:middle line:84%
The human being is not
just a physical body, yeah?

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Indeed.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SOWAH: The human
body is a network

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:10.520 align:middle line:10%
of physical, emotional,
spiritual, psychological,

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.400 align:middle line:10%
social, and all of that.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, just
physical movement

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:90%
alone may not be the answer.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Can't be.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.380 align:middle line:90%
We're multidimensional.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: We are
multidimensional.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So just depending
on the physical act

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of movement as the answer
is as good as thinking

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:84%
you can just take vitamin
C and you'll be well.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:84%
The various vitamins
that your body needs

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:90%
have to work together.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are responsible
for becoming the vehicles

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.590 align:middle line:90%
for carrying other chemicals.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So they all need to be
meeting in the same place

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.460 align:middle line:84%
at the right time to
affect functioning.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The moving alchemist.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.665 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:33:04.665 --> 00:33:07.830 align:middle line:90%
We believe dance is healing.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I say dance has the
potential for healing.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Dance is the
potential for healing.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Movement is.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:13.890 align:middle line:10%
>>SOWAH: What that means--

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:10%
movement has the
potential for healing.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But how do we create the
context, the environment,

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:27.495 align:middle line:84%
and orchestrate a system that
allows various elements to come

00:33:27.495 --> 00:33:28.295 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:33:28.295 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So I know many people who
have been destroyed by dance.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Sports is supposed
to be good for you.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I know many people who have
been destroyed by sports.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Music is supposed to be
good for your health.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I know many people who have
been destroyed by their music

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.630 align:middle line:90%
careers.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
as a human society,

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:56.930 align:middle line:84%
knowing what we know based on
research, based on history,

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.860 align:middle line:84%
how do we create a
contemporary model

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that actually brings the
best of the human experience

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:11.139 align:middle line:84%
to the center of our
evolving society?

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:90%
What is dance?

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And what are our needs?

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And how is dance
meeting the needs?

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.109 align:middle line:90%
We have to stay and play, right?

00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: [LAUGHS]

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So many of
Nii Armah's students

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:84%
have left his classes
changed people.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:27.549 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at their stories.

00:34:27.549 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I met Nii Armah at the 1000
Voices Project when I first

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.699 align:middle line:10%
attended in 2017.

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:84%
>> I met Nii Armah in 2010
as a student at CU Boulder.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:47.012 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of concerns relating
to personal identity and power.

00:34:47.012 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, during
that time, I had

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:53.320 align:middle line:84%
no idea those were issues that
were really affecting my life.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Nii Armah was the first
person that showed me that it

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.930 align:middle line:84%
was possible to just let it
out and let your spirit out,

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.350 align:middle line:90%
let it be free.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> He really taught me
to consider my strengths

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:10.392 align:middle line:84%
and the things that I can offer
the world that nobody else can

00:35:10.392 --> 00:35:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and to consider the
same in other people,

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and to nurture that.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I went at the
suggestion my counselor,

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.910 align:middle line:84%
whom I was seeing for
post-traumatic stress

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.800 align:middle line:90%
and bereavement.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I met Nii Armah in 2017
when I first took his class,

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.593 align:middle line:90%
African dance, at CU Boulder.

00:35:27.593 --> 00:35:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I was really struggling
with depression.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's a battle every day.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:84%
But he showed me ways in
which to deal with that,

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to cope with it, to have a
place where I can just let go.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I had been struggling for
years with depression, anxiety,

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:90%
sleeping.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.200 align:middle line:90%
I had insomnia.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the very beginning of
my freshman year, a lot of that

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:84%
culminated into an
eating disorder.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:84%
There was still a huge aspect
of healing that was missing.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> That place, those moments,
that hour twice a week that I

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.260 align:middle line:84%
took the class with him made the
rest of my life easier to bear.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> He is a representation
of what is very possible

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.520 align:middle line:90%
for people like me.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Interactions with Nii
Armah and the things

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.180 align:middle line:84%
that I have learned
from Nii Armah

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:84%
have moved to me to be
the woman that I am today,

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and just the person that I am,
not only in my small community,

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.620 align:middle line:90%
but also as a global citizen.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> What I find most helpful
about going are the messages

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.920 align:middle line:90%
of the songs.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.140 align:middle line:10%
For example, the first
one we always start with

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:51.730 align:middle line:10%
is, we have so much
to be thankful for.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:10%
And I need to make
the decision every day

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.880 align:middle line:10%
to be thankful for something--
be thankful for much.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember when he said, it
doesn't matter what you have,

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:84%
it matters how you feel
about what you have.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I probably think about that
every single day in my life.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.794 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:10.794 --> 00:37:13.229 align:middle line:90%

00:37:13.229 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: [SIGHS] Nii Armah.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What have you
learned about teaching

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:90%
American university students?

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they are
quite moved by you.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.430 align:middle line:84%
What are you gleaning
from this experience?

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: What I'm gleaning
from this experience

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:35.080 align:middle line:84%
is that everybody has
something to offer.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Every human being,
every race, every people

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:90%
have something to offer.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:48.440 align:middle line:10%
And for me, it's
fascinating to see students

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:55.960 align:middle line:10%
who have all the material
stuff they could want,

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.862 align:middle line:10%
and yet struggling.

00:37:59.862 --> 00:38:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Feel that
they have nothing.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yep.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:90%
I hear this saying a lot.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I went to Africa.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.958 align:middle line:90%
I went to this village.

00:38:05.958 --> 00:38:06.990 align:middle line:90%
They have nothing.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.790 align:middle line:90%
They have nothing.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.780 align:middle line:90%
But they were so happy.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, they had happy.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:11.735 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And that's something.

00:38:11.735 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: [LAUGHS]

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That's something everyone
who has everything is seeking,

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.570 align:middle line:90%
is the happy.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So how I have conceived
of this whole picture is

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.485 align:middle line:84%
that if a human being
is an emotional being,

00:38:23.485 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:84%
is a physical being,
is a spiritual being,

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:84%
is a social being,
is a psychological

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.850 align:middle line:84%
being, yeah, then
what that means

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.870 align:middle line:84%
is that for a person to
be well, that person needs

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:90%
to grow in all these areas.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.760 align:middle line:90%
So if I see kids--

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, growing up myself--

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that sense of freedom to
go out and fend for myself,

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:53.670 align:middle line:84%
the freedom to create, make
my own toys-- that freedom

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to be in fights and
still come out strong,

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:04.600 align:middle line:84%
or that feeling a sense of
belonging in a community, yeah?

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: All those where--

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I call them emotional weights to
build your emotional strength--

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
weights, the social.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
All those challenges are
weights for your growth.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Just that some people
would go and lift

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:28.890 align:middle line:84%
weights physically to
build, what I see is this.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.710 align:middle line:84%
If you have all
your material needs

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:37.420 align:middle line:84%
met and you have all your
physical needs met, yeah,

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and for some reason,
emotionally you struggle--

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:46.060 align:middle line:84%
spiritually bankrupt,
socially unskilled,

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:90%
psychologically unbalanced--

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.870 align:middle line:84%
now, you don't want to
tell me you're rich.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to tell me you
have all the things you want.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:84%
If you tell me that, it means
you're seeing yourself only

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.170 align:middle line:90%
as a physical being.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you are a physical,
emotional, spiritual, social,

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and psychological mental
being, then maybe you

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:84%
might want to consider
these as necessary

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.590 align:middle line:84%
so that you have actually
got all you need.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you find
somebody who, physically,

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:32.060 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, they are resilient.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They can laugh in the
face of challenge.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.120 align:middle line:90%
They can overcome trauma.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: But they
don't have shoes,

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.360 align:middle line:90%
maybe we can ship shoes to them.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:90%
We can ship food.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:84%
But if a person is emotionally,
spiritually bankrupt,

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:90%
there is not much we can ship.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
are life-long processes

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of cultivating.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't have
it, you can't go buy it.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I think these are crucial.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.340 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual, emotional,
social, and stuff

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.145 align:middle line:84%
are overlooked in our
evaluation of what good life is.

00:41:15.145 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Couldn't agree more.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:84%
We have to approach it from
this whole person perspective.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Mm-hmm.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you give us
an example of someone

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.320 align:middle line:84%
who has had a profound
transformation?

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Can you walk us through a
before and an after that

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.860 align:middle line:84%
you have had the
opportunity to steward

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.250 align:middle line:90%
or to witness in your days?

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: I hesitate
to be specific.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But I've had students who have
come in broken with depression

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.600 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety disorder
or eating disorder,

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.280 align:middle line:90%
where it's become clinical.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen some
students who initially

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:59.510 align:middle line:84%
have been scared to even look
at another person in the eye,

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.750 align:middle line:84%
or a student who's been scared
to even speak in a circle--

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:84%
more so dance in the
middle of the circle.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:11.980 align:middle line:10%
I've seen students overcome
their fears, gotten

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:10%
their depression under control,
eating disorder under control,

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.180 align:middle line:10%
social anxiety under control--

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:10%
not because we do
anything specifically

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.580 align:middle line:10%
to address any of these things.

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.380 align:middle line:84%
But what I believe is, if a
person lives in a community

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and feel a sense of
belonging, and they practice

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:39.520 align:middle line:84%
being human in terms of
giving, taking, sharing, asking

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.010 align:middle line:84%
help, giving if
somebody in need,

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.310 align:middle line:84%
taking responsibility, being
accountable-- all those things,

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:47.560 align:middle line:90%
they build the whole person.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the process, the
fears and all the insecurities

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.150 align:middle line:84%
are taken care of because
of that sense of belonging

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:00.570 align:middle line:90%
and that authentic relationship.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:04.590 align:middle line:10%
And so people will say, these
are the best relationships

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:10%
I've had in this university.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time I
have a real relationship.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, all these things
that people say

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:84%
is a result of creating the
environment for life to unfold.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:10%
And a fully lived life is
physically therapeutic.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.940 align:middle line:84%
What about this
power of intention?

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.370 align:middle line:10%
What role does intention--
this ownership--

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:39.280 align:middle line:10%
and you spoke about personal
responsibility-- what

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.830 align:middle line:10%
can someone do to ensure that
as they're moving through dance,

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:48.100 align:middle line:10%
as they're allowing themselves
to be a little bit more

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:52.420 align:middle line:10%
physically mobile and allowing
those tissues to unwind

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.280 align:middle line:10%
a bit and energies to
flow through their body,

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.030 align:middle line:10%
what can they do with
their mind and their heart

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.300 align:middle line:10%
in terms of intention and
personal responsibility

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.840 align:middle line:10%
to ensure that it actually
has a therapeutic effect

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.033 align:middle line:10%
in their life?

00:44:06.033 --> 00:44:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a difference
between just going out,

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:08.710 align:middle line:90%
dancing--

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: And dancing.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --and dancing with the
true spirit and the awareness

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and the embodiment of this
personally responsible

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:84%
individual who gets and claims
that this is my life and I

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:25.180 align:middle line:84%
get to be free and intentional
on these multiple dimensions

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.110 align:middle line:90%
of my being.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.530 align:middle line:84%
What can you share to help
people ensure that they're

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:84%
going to get the benefits
out of this movement

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.680 align:middle line:90%
choice in their lives?

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: There are many.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I think one is for
students to understand

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.860 align:middle line:90%
the power of the will--

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:90%
the will--

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The will.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: --to will yourself.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Also understanding
that it is a journey.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I tell students,
this is not a sprint.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a marathon.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.790 align:middle line:90%
So don't expect to be perfect.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:03.070 align:middle line:84%
You may be an A student
in all your courses,

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:09.430 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of somatic literacy
or somatic intelligence, you

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:13.540 align:middle line:84%
may not be an adult.
You may be a baby.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So as a baby, you should have
baby expectations of yourself.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Be kind to yourself.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So I name all these things that
make people feel permission

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.916 align:middle line:90%
to be where they are at.

00:45:24.916 --> 00:45:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm-hmm.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.190 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.920 align:middle line:84%
How do they heal
through movement?

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.740 align:middle line:90%
What happens right there?

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Self-acceptance.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Self-acceptance.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I tell students, I want you to
take this as a pillow fight.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.770 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:44.770 align:middle line:90%
I use that a lot.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.550 align:middle line:84%
When you are pillow
fighting, you

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:49.642 align:middle line:84%
laugh whether you're
winning or losing.

00:45:49.642 --> 00:45:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: [LAUGHS] This is true.

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: And you fight hard.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: But your
self-esteem is not attached

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.080 align:middle line:90%
to winning a pillow fight.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.610 align:middle line:90%
It's just play.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So I have students
begin to goof off.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So the whole first
week, few weeks of class

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.710 align:middle line:84%
is what I call the
puppy dog phase--

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:middle line:90%
pillow-fighting spirit.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.400 align:middle line:90%
So we sing silly songs.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.340 align:middle line:90%
We do silly movements.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Oh my gosh.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: And I require everybody
to get to know everybody.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Because to the extent to
which you know everyone,

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.290 align:middle line:90%
to that extent you feel at home.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel at home,
you can pillow fight.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You connect.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: If you don't
connect, you may not

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:35.770 align:middle line:90%
be living your full life.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So in that process
of giving them

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.660 align:middle line:84%
permission to do things they
can succeed at, like walking--

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.520 align:middle line:84%
so I have students walk and
turn their walk into dance.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sense of success
gives some students

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.950 align:middle line:84%
like, I didn't
know I could dance.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:53.940 align:middle line:90%
I just danced.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:54.240 align:middle line:90%
I just--

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.642 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: [LAUGHS] I just did that.

00:46:55.642 --> 00:46:56.809 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: So it's just basic.

00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So how would you set
up a class to make

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:02.915 align:middle line:84%
students feel successful
at every step of the way?

00:47:02.915 --> 00:47:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then
what happens when

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:07.980 align:middle line:84%
they dance with other
people differently than when

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.110 align:middle line:90%
they just dance?

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: I think when you
dance with other people,

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:15.090 align:middle line:84%
there's element of
being witnessed,

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:21.660 align:middle line:84%
there's element of human
connection that is empowering.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.735 align:middle line:84%
And for many, they have
not experienced that.

00:47:24.735 --> 00:47:27.880 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
have evolved in dance,

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.570 align:middle line:90%
but the dance is internal.

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a place for
that kind of dance.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But when people begin
to dance in community,

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.800 align:middle line:84%
it is different
because you are dancing

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.420 align:middle line:84%
as a member of a
supportive community.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And it ceases to be
about just the movement.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a different experience.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, so it's a
communion, it's an expression,

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's a receptivity
at the same time.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yup.

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's the
experience of oneness,

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.370 align:middle line:90%
not the concept of oneness.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yup.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So I tell students, when
you stand in the circle

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and somebody goes
to dance, I want

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.150 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine this is
your two-year-old niece

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:12.707 align:middle line:84%
or one-year-old nephew
who is trying to walk.

00:48:12.707 --> 00:48:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.230 align:middle line:90%
You're encouraging.

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: What do you do?

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Make them walk, take another
step, or sit back down.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.280 align:middle line:90%
This is a community fire.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.950 align:middle line:90%
We all have to tend it.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:27.970 align:middle line:90%
So in this, it takes a village.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.510 align:middle line:90%
We practice it--

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: --in the dance circle.

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And people slowly
find their strength

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and begin to believe
in themselves.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the movement,
but it is the environment.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So they become
vulnerable and expressive

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and then connected kind of
within seconds of each other.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes, yes.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And that's the opening.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So the vulnerability
is the best weight.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.420 align:middle line:90%
How do you push through?

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have songs we sing that
address each of these things.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.180 align:middle line:90%
For example, we have a chant.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.430 align:middle line:90%
We say, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.960 align:middle line:84%
This is Pidgin
English from Ghana.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
that, as a community member,

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.020 align:middle line:90%
you get as much as you put in.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.220 align:middle line:90%
If you put--

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You reap.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: --you reap.

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And "chop" in Pidgin
English means "eat."

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:37.960 align:middle line:84%
If you contribute, you get
to partake in the product.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.163 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't, it's
not going to happen.

00:49:40.163 --> 00:49:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: If you
don't, you're stuck.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yeah.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, you talk about
emotional constipation.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Is this one of the ways
that you would unpack that?

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Describe this to us.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: I like to
say that research

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:55.690 align:middle line:84%
has shown that our
bodies are repositories

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:59.310 align:middle line:84%
of our experiences, whether
physical experience,

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.160 align:middle line:84%
emotional experience,
or our thoughts.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are repositories
of our experiences.

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: They hold
our unresolvedness.

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.567 align:middle line:84%
The body holds
what's not resolved.

00:50:07.567 --> 00:50:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: They hold it.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And one thing we know
is that our bodies have

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.900 align:middle line:90%
ways of recycling or purging.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.510 align:middle line:90%
So let's say you are hurt.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Something hits you.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.510 align:middle line:90%
You move.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And at the height of that
movement, you make a sound.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Or let's say you are happy.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:35.550 align:middle line:84%
You make a sound, and you
have a movement to go with it.

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:84%
When you are in pain,
you make a sound

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
movement to go with it.

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:42.420 align:middle line:10%
When you are angry,
you make a sound

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.463 align:middle line:10%
and you make a physical
motion to go with it.

00:50:45.463 --> 00:50:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It doesn't get
to stop somewhere.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:47.743 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: It doesn't get to stop.

00:50:47.743 --> 00:50:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You just keep it moving.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: It's flushing.

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.776 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Got it.

00:50:49.776 --> 00:50:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: It's moving.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we will live lives
where we inhibit expression,

00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:01.880 align:middle line:84%
whether vocal,
emotional, or physical,

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.000 align:middle line:84%
where do we think
the energy goes?

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.992 align:middle line:90%
I like to say this.

00:51:07.992 --> 00:51:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the body
needs you to yawn--

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:13.540 align:middle line:90%
And so it does.

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: --to flow.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the body
needs you to sneeze.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.920 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.260 align:middle line:10%
What happens when
you refuse to yawn?

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.520 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
you refuse to sneeze?

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.390 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So if our body in our daily
experience is designed

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:37.910 align:middle line:84%
to express what is going
on-- so you are happy,

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:42.140 align:middle line:84%
you express joy physically;
you are angry, you express it;

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.260 align:middle line:90%
you are happy, you express it--

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.130 align:middle line:90%
expression is huge.

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And movement is that
avenue for letting us

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.540 align:middle line:90%
process our experiences fully.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we live in societies
where our movements are

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:03.080 align:middle line:84%
curtailed, even our
voices are curtailed,

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.110 align:middle line:84%
coming to African
dance and dancing,

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.990 align:middle line:84%
coming to African
dance and singing,

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:14.570 align:middle line:84%
coming to African dance and
expressing automatically taps

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:17.380 align:middle line:84%
into various centers
of your being.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And it is not a thing that
can be put into words.

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an experience
that people have.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
hard to articulate it.

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.340 align:middle line:90%
But students know.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So just to be
clear for our viewers,

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:34.580 align:middle line:84%
when that energy doesn't get
to go into full expression

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and stay in motion--

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:39.590 align:middle line:84%
make a sound, make a movement--
when it doesn't get to do that,

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:40.673 align:middle line:90%
then what happens with it?

00:52:40.673 --> 00:52:41.882 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: That's constipation.

00:52:41.882 --> 00:52:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Where does the energy go?

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And then how does this
emotional constipation

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:50.240 align:middle line:84%
show up in people's physical
lives and their symptomatology?

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.050 align:middle line:90%
What's the effect?

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.150 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to
experience and know

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that they are
emotionally constipated?

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:55.940 align:middle line:84%
How are they going
to know that's what's

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:56.740 align:middle line:90%
going on with them?

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: I cannot claim
to have any educated data

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:07.470 align:middle line:84%
on the effects or the
lack of expression--

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:08.650 align:middle line:90%
what it does to a person.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.132 align:middle line:90%


00:53:11.132 --> 00:53:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: But you can
share your experience,

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:13.630 align:middle line:90%
what you've observed.

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:14.630 align:middle line:90%
That's all we're asking.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: We know
that some students,

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:21.730 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of class, will
feel a huge wave of emotion.

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And they will just break down.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Some students might shake.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:33.088 align:middle line:10%
Some students might have "aha"
moments through the movement.

00:53:33.088 --> 00:53:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: As it's releasing.

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: As it releases.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:42.360 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's important
to look at our society,

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.120 align:middle line:10%
to see the levels
of, let's say, cancer

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:10%
or depression or
physical inhibitions

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.980 align:middle line:10%
and how people
hold their bodies,

00:53:52.980 --> 00:54:02.130 align:middle line:10%
and connect that to the
individuals' lifestyle--

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:06.400 align:middle line:10%
what they do, the
kinds of communities

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.970 align:middle line:10%
they walk in, or lack
thereof they walk in.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies reflect our
lifestyles and our values

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:16.910 align:middle line:90%
and our activities.

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you're saying that
this emotional constipation not

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:22.180 align:middle line:84%
expressing could
lead to the things

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that we consider our
disease processes.

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Diseases.

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Headaches, back
pain, indigestion, asthma,

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
allergies-- all of it has
to do with stuck energy.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Stuck emotional energy.

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Energy.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And now you're saying
also that when we engage

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.190 align:middle line:90%
in a community that is aware--

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:40.485 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Aware and supportive.

00:54:40.485 --> 00:54:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --and supportive that
this energy automatically

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:45.310 align:middle line:90%
starts flowing.

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It gets drawn up and out of
us, that which has been stuck--

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Stuck.

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --et cetera.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So when people don't have
a community surrounding them,

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.470 align:middle line:90%
what can they do?

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: Well, up until now,
we have dependent on medication

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:01.640 align:middle line:90%
to numb things.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.226 align:middle line:84%
Well, those days
are numbered, right?

00:55:04.226 --> 00:55:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: They are.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:06.417 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: People are waking up.

00:55:06.417 --> 00:55:08.380 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be another way.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: By now, we know
that the allopathic is not

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:12.660 align:middle line:90%
the answer to all.

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.868 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Not the whole picture.

00:55:13.868 --> 00:55:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: There is a place
for allopathic medicine.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: And what we
are saying is this.

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:25.330 align:middle line:84%
As human beings, we
are wired to express.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:26.830 align:middle line:90%
We are wired to move.

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:29.050 align:middle line:90%
We are wired to connect.

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we stop those
things, inhibit those things,

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.630 align:middle line:90%
there are consequences.

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And the solution is not to
band-aid the consequences,

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:46.530 align:middle line:84%
but to rethink what
we call "normal life,"

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:middle line:84%
to think what we call a normal
way of being in relationships,

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and ask ourselves, are we
going in the right direction?

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Or do we need to recalibrate
our, what we call,

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.870 align:middle line:84%
"decent," what we
call "respectable,"

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:03.240 align:middle line:90%
what we call "normal"?

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do in class
is just that-- questioning

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.520 align:middle line:90%
what people consider normal.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And as a human society,
the question I ask

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:18.120 align:middle line:84%
is, when we talk
about innovation,

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.880 align:middle line:84%
we have made
innovations in machines.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We have made innovations
in all sorts of ways.

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So we don't use iPhone
4 as much as we used to.

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.960 align:middle line:90%
We are now at iPhone 10.

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:36.540 align:middle line:84%
As humans, how much do we
invest in rethinking our--

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Internal world.

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: --our internal
world, our social constructs

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:43.255 align:middle line:90%
of reality, our spiritual--

00:56:43.255 --> 00:56:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The invisible.

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: --the invisible.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking at ways
to upgrade the human?

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:55.590 align:middle line:10%
You speak about dance
being a human right.

00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:57.735 align:middle line:10%
Can you elaborate
on that for us?

00:56:57.735 --> 00:57:00.930 align:middle line:10%
>>SOWAH: Well,
there's no saying.

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Every human society has dance.

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know from
research that Europeans

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:15.300 align:middle line:84%
used to dance ecstatic dances
and wild dances, human dances.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, with
the Puritanic movement,

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:20.350 align:middle line:90%
all these things were--

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Shut down.

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: --shut down.

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Now we have consequences.

00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So basically, my case for the
need for everyone to dance

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:36.780 align:middle line:84%
has something to do with, one,
the movement, two, rhythm,

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.870 align:middle line:90%
three, in community.

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And they transcended
into the spirit.

00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:49.080 align:middle line:84%
All of these are necessary
for the full benefit of dance.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I like to see dance I
say like a landscape.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.860 align:middle line:84%
When you look out in the
window, you see the mountains.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.270 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:58.740 align:middle line:90%
We can groom the mountain.

00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.940 align:middle line:84%
We can groom the forest
to look beautiful.

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:06.900 align:middle line:84%
But to think that the purpose
of the forest or the landscape

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:11.550 align:middle line:84%
is just for beauty
is a little wanting

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:17.260 align:middle line:84%
because we know that the forest
has more to offer humanity

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.237 align:middle line:90%
than just pretty.

00:58:18.237 --> 00:58:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Than meets the eye.

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Meets the eye.

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.972 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: More than meets the eye.

00:58:20.972 --> 00:58:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: In the same way,
much as I appreciate art,

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate aesthetic
of movement or music,

00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I know these human phenomena
are not only for beauty.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: There is a wave and
a pulsation to the whole

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.010 align:middle line:90%
of the manifest world.

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:42.210 align:middle line:90%
All of creation is moving.

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:44.780 align:middle line:84%
The constellations are
moving, the planetary orbits,

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.638 align:middle line:84%
the continual wave
motion of our oceans

00:58:47.638 --> 00:58:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and the winds, et cetera.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in movement.

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when we as human beings
start to clamp down on our life

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:59.720 align:middle line:84%
experience and we carry
stress and we carry stiffness

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and rigidity, is this movement
within the human bandwidth

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:08.210 align:middle line:90%
becoming extinct?

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Are we shutting it
down to the point

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that there will be
tremendous effect?

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what
effects do you see?

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Here's I see it.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I feel that as human beings,
we are daily evolving.

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:27.860 align:middle line:90%
We are daily transforming.

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.900 align:middle line:84%
The question is, which
direction are we going?

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Because every day,
our lives are impacted

00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:38.460 align:middle line:84%
by what we see, what
we smell, what we hear.

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Our diet determines
what direction we go.

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I say is that
we have natural systems.

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:54.130 align:middle line:10%
And some of these natural
systems do not change.

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:58.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, our bodies
are wired to be used.

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:04.060 align:middle line:84%
If we don't use it, certain
parts of our brains get toast.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:10.280 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Certain parts of
our brains are reduced to--

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They go dormant.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Shut down.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: --dormancy.

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:15.120 align:middle line:90%
So the question is this.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.160 align:middle line:84%
In our development,
where we have

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.880 align:middle line:84%
so much material
and external stuff,

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.890 align:middle line:84%
what price are we
paying internally?

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:31.650 align:middle line:84%
The human being is upright
and functioning, I say,

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:34.060 align:middle line:90%
because of polyrhythm.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.710 align:middle line:84%
There is brain function,
movement, there's heart,

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
there is lungs, there is
ribs, there is peristalsis.

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
movement in the body.

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Even within the heart, there's
so much rhythm in there.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And every part of the
body works in its own way

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
to contribute to
the common good.

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And as we begin to tap
in to this polyrhythmic reality

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that we are, what is our
greatest asset that we can

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
offer to a society
that is disconnected,

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that is not well, that is
not in their wholeness,

01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:16.695 align:middle line:84%
and we would
consider sick or ill?

01:01:16.695 --> 01:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
What can we offer once we
connect our multiplicity

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
into a unified, empowered,
soulful individual?

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:28.870 align:middle line:90%
What happens there?

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:36.630 align:middle line:10%
>>SOWAH: I think when I would
talk to folks about healing,

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:42.150 align:middle line:10%
many people tend to focus
on healing for themselves.

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think we find our
healing in the context

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:51.290 align:middle line:84%
of our interdependence
in our relationships.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:55.820 align:middle line:90%
It's like a matrix of healing.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, as I
give of my best to you,

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:05.070 align:middle line:90%
I receive what I need.

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as a society,
we are losing that lens

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.880 align:middle line:84%
in terms of seeing how
our wellness depends

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.050 align:middle line:90%
on the wellness of others.

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So in this healing
matrix that you're referencing,

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
we're perceiving ourselves
as a bigger being.

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
We're interconnected to the
point that they belong to us,

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.000 align:middle line:90%
we belong to them.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.840 align:middle line:90%
There is no other.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a bigger being.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're thinking too
small when it's me,

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
me, me, and we're
trying to heal.

01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The reason we don't heal
when it's a me, me, me,

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.790 align:middle line:84%
is that we're isolating
and thinking too small.

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:45.190 align:middle line:90%
So you're saying, let's expand.

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's open up.

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's allow communion in this.

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: I see it this way.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
When you tend to think
just about yourself,

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you have a
tape of self-doubt--

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
tape of self-criticism,
a tape of imperfection.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But the moment
you begin to think

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
of others, their
well-being, you're

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.250 align:middle line:90%
not focusing on yourself.

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
You begin to participate
in the common good.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, that sense
of fulfillment,

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.980 align:middle line:84%
that sense of purpose,
when you begin

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to play your part in the
whole, that sense of purpose

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.330 align:middle line:90%
is the root of healing.

01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:30.380 align:middle line:90%
It's empowering.

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:37.290 align:middle line:10%
It's life-giving when you begin
to find your purpose in life.

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: In that self-doubt
in the "me, me, me,"

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
focus, what happens is, we
feel like something is missing.

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we start running the mind
and writing a story about what

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.487 align:middle line:90%
it could possibly be--

01:03:48.487 --> 01:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm not enough of this,
or I'm not enough of that,

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.020 align:middle line:90%
or I compare myself--

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
all because there's a sense
that something is missing.

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
saying is missing

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
is our realization that
there's a larger organism here

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.370 align:middle line:90%
that we call community.

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I start
thinking of others, too,

01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I include myself in
that larger organism.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel a greater
sense of fulfillment

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
because I'm allowing
more energies,

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.340 align:middle line:84%
more diversity to be a
part of my personal world

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and my personal identity.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes?

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yes.

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:22.437 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That's where
the healing happens.

01:04:22.437 --> 01:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So you become
part of a bigger energy.

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I do a lot in my work

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.090 align:middle line:90%
is naming these things as we go.

01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody comes
in the circle to dance,

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
it is not for you to
judge them or think

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
how you're going to beat them.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:45.673 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to make them
be the best they could be.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Celebrate them.

01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Celebrate them.

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come
in, no matter who you are,

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.100 align:middle line:90%
people celebrate you.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And when we create that
society, then we'll

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
be heading somewhere-- a
society where we look out

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.880 align:middle line:90%
for the best in each other.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.450 align:middle line:90%
We look out for the best.

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you speak
about restoring harmony

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
within the individual in
order to heal relationships?

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.848 align:middle line:90%
Restoring harmony.

01:05:16.848 --> 01:05:17.732 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: [SCOFFS]

01:05:17.732 --> 01:05:18.620 align:middle line:90%


01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are
all works in progress.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.925 align:middle line:90%
And I said it before--

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.650 align:middle line:90%
self-acceptance is huge.

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:34.790 align:middle line:10%
So one metaphor I
use a lot in my work

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:42.210 align:middle line:10%
is that of the making
of the butterfly.

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:43.650 align:middle line:10%
When you see the
cocoon, when you

01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:48.780 align:middle line:10%
see the various stages
of the butterfly, or even

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.235 align:middle line:10%
when you see a plant--

01:05:50.235 --> 01:05:52.890 align:middle line:10%
a bud grow into a flower--

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:56.030 align:middle line:10%
it starts like this.

01:05:56.030 --> 01:06:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Everything in that
plant is pushing.

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Rise.

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: That is our job.

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you feel the need to
push, when you have challenges,

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:09.660 align:middle line:90%
it's not the end.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
That push is
necessary to come out

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:16.830 align:middle line:90%
with wings that will not fall.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
That push is necessary to
build the necessary strength

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.130 align:middle line:90%
to face the world.

01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I tell the students, when
you feel the challenge, that

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.620 align:middle line:90%
is where the medicine is.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:36.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, accepting that each part
belongs in the larger picture

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:37.930 align:middle line:10%
brings acceptance.

01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I tell them, if
you see a tree that is 2 feet,

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that tree is not ashamed
because another tree is 10.

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: (LAUGHING) Right.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: Because that tree
understands that in its 2 feet,

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that is the height
of its present glory

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.130 align:middle line:90%
and it is going to keep going.

01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Any time you feel ashamed
for your position in life,

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.420 align:middle line:84%
you interfere with
your potential.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So self-acceptance,
understanding the larger

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:13.120 align:middle line:84%
picture, and know that it's a
journey makes you not beat down

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:13.920 align:middle line:90%
on yourself.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The tree doesn't have
an opinion of itself.

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yeah.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:18.725 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We cultivate opinions
about ourselves, which--

01:07:18.725 --> 01:07:19.735 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: Yeah, It's
just being a tree.

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --stops it.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.545 align:middle line:84%
We learn and awaken
through resistance.

01:07:22.545 --> 01:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
This is what you're
saying, that don't back off

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.290 align:middle line:90%
when there is resistance.

01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:28.595 align:middle line:84%
Learn and grow and
allow that power--

01:07:28.595 --> 01:07:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: The push.

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:33.353 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --and the push to be
your guide, to be your path.

01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So I sometimes
put it this way.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I say, if you see a flower
coming out and it's pushing

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.580 align:middle line:90%
and you go and open the pedal--

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.862 align:middle line:84%
the outer one-- that
plant is stunted.

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, it
won't do its thing.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: So the idea of
love, the idea of supporting

01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
each other, does not
mean we should take away

01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
the individual's power
for self-determination.

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It is important, the push.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But you just need the support
to do the pushing ourselves.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, accepting what is is
part of finding harmony

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.100 align:middle line:90%
with what you are.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.050 align:middle line:90%
The moment we hate the journey--

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.819 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, love
is the key, right.

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:17.979 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: [LAUGHS]

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I call it the
universal solvent.

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Yup.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.152 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Everything
dissolves in love.

01:08:21.152 --> 01:08:22.069 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Love, mm-hmm.

01:08:22.069 --> 01:08:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So in this
exchange of love,

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
we know that
community is easier.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We know that
bonding through love

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
generates community faster
versus trying to make our way

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.729 align:middle line:84%
and be competitive
and earn our way in--

01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:37.029 align:middle line:90%
just to love our way into it.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:41.319 align:middle line:10%
Can you speak about how
healing through community

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.711 align:middle line:10%
can truly heal the world?

01:08:43.711 --> 01:08:49.370 align:middle line:90%


01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SOWAH: I think
there's no other way.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.279 align:middle line:84%
There's no other way to
be well in isolation.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:09:05.220 align:middle line:10%
And I feel that our current
paradigm fosters competition,

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.770 align:middle line:10%
individualism, and isolation.

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:12.830 align:middle line:10%
And that process makes
us go fast sometimes.

01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But there is an African
proverb that says this.

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:20.315 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go
fast, go alone.

01:09:20.315 --> 01:09:24.779 align:middle line:10%
But if you want to go
far, go in community.

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
How do we ensure that
every step we take

01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:35.479 align:middle line:84%
is really a forward step and
not a backward one, or just

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:37.479 align:middle line:90%
a step only to fall back?

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, in my little
way, I am using dance,

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:48.359 align:middle line:84%
I'm using singing, I'm using
storytelling and the community

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:53.390 align:middle line:84%
circle as a metaphor for
reimagining a better world--

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
a world that is consistent
with the divine principles that

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.410 align:middle line:90%
guide our lives.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we depart from
the natural contours of life,

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
we build something magnificent,
only for it to fall apart.

01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So I am interested
in inspiring students

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to begin to question
their purpose in life,

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.220 align:middle line:90%
their place in life.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.270 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And how are you
participating in creating

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
a more livable, sustainable,
and peaceful world?

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:32.620 align:middle line:10%
Healing is not about me, me, me.

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Healing is a matrix.

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.980 align:middle line:90%
We are interconnected.

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:40.282 align:middle line:84%
And our health depends on
our interconnectedness.

01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:41.365 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank you so much--

01:10:41.365 --> 01:10:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Thank you.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --for what you are
bringing to this world

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and weaving things
back together again.

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anyone will
ever look at dance and song

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and music the same again after
they hear this conversation.

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
It is most beautiful
and most significant.

01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being with us.

01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SOWAH: Thank you.

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:00.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Medicine is not the only
way you can heal your body.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And healing doesn't
have to be painful.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.910 align:middle line:90%
It can be joyful.

01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
If we suffer physically,
emotionally, and spiritually,

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to mend
those wounds alone.

What Nii Armah is
doing is proof that we

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:18.640 align:middle line:90%
heal best within community.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.580 align:middle line:84%

we are all connected.
