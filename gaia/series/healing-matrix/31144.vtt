>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Raise your hand

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
if you have the
perfect love life.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
If your hand's in the
air, congratulations.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:10%
Most of us struggle
throughout our lifetime

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:10%
trying to find that sweet spot
of passionate, ecstatic love

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:10%
with our partners, while
maintaining careers, raising

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:10%
kids, and quarreling over money.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:10%
For the most part,
the sex suffers.

Ellen Eatough, called
The Soulful Sex Coach,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
has been one of those women who
has found the keys to enjoying

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
an ecstatic love life
with her partner.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Her other passion is
to help others identify

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
the blocks to transcendent
sex and establish a deeper,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
even mystical connection
with our partners.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:10%
I know a lot of people
are looking for that.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:10%
We tend to throw up
every roadblock we can.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:10%
But I have one question.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is, is it true that
the honeymoon has to end?

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLEN EATOUGH:
I don't think so.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:10%
I think that relationships
will definitely change,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:10%
and the brain chemistry
changes the longer

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:10%
you've been with somebody.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:10%
So it will change.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.180 align:middle line:10%
To maybe by definition of
honeymoon, it has to end.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But the love and the
sex and the intimacy

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.242 align:middle line:84%
can grow and get better and
better through the years.

00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I always hear people say, oh,
come on grow up, get real.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:90%
You're too idealistic.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Of course the honeymoon
period has to end.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I think of
the honeymoon period,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I think of that kind of
tender connectedness,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and the choice to be
connected, and to make

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:84%
the relationship a priority as
part of the honeymoon period.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've never understood
why it does have to end.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
That just sounds
like a cop-out so

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
that we can become lazy and fall
into bad habits, which we do.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like a cop-out to me.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.057 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, I just
wanted your take on it.

00:02:10.057 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well it
also depends on how

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:84%
late into the relationship
the honeymoon actually occurs.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Because in the first
period of time,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.327 align:middle line:84%
there's brain chemistry that
actually is like being on a--

00:02:21.327 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On a drug.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: On an addictive drug.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And the blinders are on.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
The rest of our life
falls into the fog

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.467 align:middle line:84%
as we focus all of our energy
and attention on this person.

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And then also, people often
think of the honeymoon

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:90%
as having sex five times a day.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And so that's going to change.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.869 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But it can
be less frequent sex

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:90%
that's even better.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:84%
The sweetness can
still be there.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.381 align:middle line:90%
I think, anyway.

00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's get
into introducing you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.909 align:middle line:84%
to the viewers a
little bit, because you

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:90%
have an interesting background.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of backed into
this whole soulful sex thing.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what
you set out to do.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.179 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Never.

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:58.428 align:middle line:84%
I would have been the last
one in my high school class

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:01.349 align:middle line:84%
to be voted to have anything
to do with sexuality for work,

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.015 align:middle line:90%
that's for sure.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And so you were
a hypnotherapist,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
but you also got your master's
in East-West Psychology.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And you were really trying
to put the pieces together as

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
to the deeper functioning
of the human psyche.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.846 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Absolutely.

00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that journey

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and how you ended up bumping
into this whole ecstatic sex

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
area that you have
now made your life.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well,
I had always been

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
interested in spiritual
development, in psychology,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:84%
in the connection between
science and spirituality.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And also, I'd always
been interested

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
in deeper and deeper levels
of intimate relationship.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.215 align:middle line:84%
And wanting to connect that
with my spiritual sense

00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual source.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So those were ongoing
interests in my life.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I was thrilled
to find that there

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
was a master's degree program
in East-West Psychology, which

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
is a marriage of Western
psychology and Eastern

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.150 align:middle line:90%
spiritual traditions.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So that was a
perfect fit for me.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, I
actually ended up spontaneously

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
discovering this whole
sexual spiritual connection

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:90%
through personal experience.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.887 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:04:15.887 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Kind of got
catapulted into this.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.136 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And after
that, you have

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh my god,
what just happened?

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.314 align:middle line:90%
How do I maintain it?

00:04:22.314 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, how do you
teach others, ultimately.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.905 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So my partner and I are
looking at each other going

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:84%
like, well, how come nobody
ever told us that this existed?

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was motivated to
somehow try to share that.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I was already working
with people on releasing issues

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
which tended to skew toward
sexual and relationship

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:90%
wounding and trauma.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'd been doing that
for a number of years

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:90%
before we even met.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
But now I was
inspired to take it

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
to the positive side of
the spectrum and say,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:84%
wow, how do we help people
experience this exalted realm

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.686 align:middle line:90%
in sexuality?

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered
in my graduate program,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
when I heard a speaker, that
there was research happening

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
on this, and we
weren't the only ones.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.811 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
beyond Masters and Johnsons

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:12.524 align:middle line:90%
kind of research?

00:05:12.524 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Absolutely.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:13.755 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.911 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, maybe
just share with us

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
the characteristics of what
an ecstatic sexual experience

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:90%
is like.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, it
can vary tremendously.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But my personal definition
is a combination

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
of intense sexual
physical pleasure combined

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
with deep emotional intimacy
and a sense of spiritual union.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.844 align:middle line:84%
That's union-- I can talk about
the difference between those.

00:05:41.844 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.535 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would think
a lot of-- even

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
if you're in an exalted
state doing something else,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.107 align:middle line:84%
there must be a
timelessness quality to it.

00:05:51.107 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Oh, yeah.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.724 align:middle line:84%
You can find God
taking out the garbage.

00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.184 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But it's
a little more fun

00:05:56.184 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:90%
when you're having sex.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And there's
an energy to it.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
There's an energy to
sexuality that, if our energy

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
channels are open, can
flow and can heighten

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:90%
the experience tremendously.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet it seems like
we have a tremendous amount--

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
a huge percentage
of the population

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:84%
has a tremendous amount invested
in throwing up boundaries

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and blocks, blockading ourselves
through some kind of fear

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
of maybe past trauma, maybe
fear of some kind of future pain

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:84%
or loss, against
the openness that's

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
required to have these
kinds of experiences.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.144 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's
a conscious investment

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:90%
against opening up.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
usually subconscious.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And there's so many
thousands of years of history,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
really, repressing
and suppressing

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
our natural sexual expression,
that vital life force.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just a natural
expression of life and nature.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But we've got so many cultural
and religious inhibitions

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
that, in addition to
all the personal family

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
stuff and relationship
stuff we've

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
all been through, this
wounding and makes

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.152 align:middle line:84%
us feel vulnerable and
reluctant to really come out.

00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
one area where

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:84%
we tend to come out less
than any other area.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
People can show up and have
sex and even have orgasms.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
you're showing up.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:84%
That's just the physical
component of it.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
part you're addressing.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.686 align:middle line:84%
If you have physical
difficulties,

00:07:24.686 --> 00:07:25.853 align:middle line:90%
it can be related to trauma.

00:07:25.853 --> 00:07:26.769 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Absolutely.

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
really looking

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:84%
at something more
transcendent than that.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: I am.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know that the
physical part could even

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:10%
get so much better when the
other aspects are in play.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In alignment.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
it a little bit.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
You just kind of
briefly tapped on it.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
That when you were dealing with
your hypnotherapy clients, who

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I assume came in for
a variety of issues

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that they were looking to heal,
almost in a Freudian sense,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that the sex seemed to be
at the basis of an awful lot

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.624 align:middle line:90%
of the people's difficulties.

00:07:56.624 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And some were conscious
of it and some weren't.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
My first client happened to be--
and I didn't put out my shingle

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.211 align:middle line:90%
to deal with sexual issues.

00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I was looking to deal
with whatever people

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:90%
wanted to release or deal with.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.052 align:middle line:84%
Chronic pain, head trauma,
migraines, whatever.

00:08:12.052 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:84%
My first client
just happened to be

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.884 align:middle line:84%
a man who'd been molested by
his uncle when he was seven.

00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So he was very conscious of
what he wanted to work on.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had people come
to me because they've

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.695 align:middle line:84%
suffered great pain in
relationships, it hurts,

00:08:24.695 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted
to get through it

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:84%
so they could move on to
a new love life somehow.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:84%
But I've also had people
who had chronic pain.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know that it
related to relationship issues.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.879 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us an
example, maybe, of a client.

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:41.545 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman who,
she'd had decades

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.239 align:middle line:90%
worth of abdominal pain.

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And all the doctors couldn't
figure out what was wrong,

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:90%
said it was all in her head.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And we started-- I don't
purposefully regress people,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but the way that I
work with people,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
with colored light projected
into the eyes, combined with--

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very potent.

00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --eye movement,
and taking people

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.195 align:middle line:84%
through-- the light
I work with has

00:09:05.195 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
an adjustable
strobic flicker rate.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I can help people slow
down into the kind of state

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
you would be in during
hypnotic induction.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:10%
So we're going into a slower
brainwave state, which gives us

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:10%
more access to our
physical sensations,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.875 align:middle line:10%
our emotional state,
more visual imagery, sort

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:10%
of more like a dream state.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:10%
And with eye movement, the
thing about eye movement

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:10%
is whenever we have
experiences and our eyes

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:10%
are in certain positions, if
they're painful experiences,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.542 align:middle line:10%
our eyes will not want
to go there again.

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Really.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
does this look like?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: You've heard of EMDR?

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: So eye
movement, pushing the brain

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:10%
to access those places
where we're uncomfortable,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.955 align:middle line:10%
can help release, and then
help the process finish.

00:09:57.955 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we don't allow
our eyes to go to that place

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.314 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want
to access the painful.

00:10:02.314 --> 00:10:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.188 align:middle line:90%
And it's totally unconscious.

00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But if we can be guided to move
our eyes into these positions,

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
it just helps us complete
the emotional processing that

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:84%
got halted, which is what causes
these blocks to get locked in.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
In working with this--
and people often

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:84%
will go into a regression of
some sort, either in this life,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:90%
or what seems to be past lives.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And so this woman
with chronic pain,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
she started to realize that
her husband and some other man

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:84%
that she knew that she had
an emotional connection with,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
she'd been relating
to from what seemed

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to be a number of past lives.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And there were battles,
and sword in the side,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.012 align:middle line:84%
and these different
kinds of stories.

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:90%
They just got released.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:10%
She went-- [SIGHS] All the story
and all the emotional stuff

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.315 align:middle line:10%
that hadn't been
processed at the time.

00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Emotions in and of
themselves don't block us.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:01.917 align:middle line:90%
It's that when they get--

00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Repressed.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --repressed
or blocked that they then

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
solidify and start
blocking our energy

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and cause us to want
to put up barriers.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And so when she finished
processing all this stuff,

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
[LOUD EXHALE] it wasn't
just understanding it.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.165 align:middle line:84%
It was experiencing
the release of that.

00:11:19.165 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Her chronic pain went away.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.664 align:middle line:84%
Her relationship
with her husband

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:26.499 align:middle line:84%
just got great, which had been
a struggle for many years.

00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
I love the fact

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:90%
that you use that technology.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
You're really big
into frequencies.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And frequencies are the
healing of the future.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:90%
They've always been.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
We've just been using
other ways to access them.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: You know why?

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because the more
subtle we go, the more powerful

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.390 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are right.

00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:47.645 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: If you're burning
a log, you can get fire,

00:11:47.645 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:90%
you can get heat.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.248 align:middle line:84%
You burn that log and
you keep putting logs on,

00:11:50.248 --> 00:11:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to get
a certain amount of heat.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to
the molecular level,

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:84%
you go to the atomic level,
and you activate that--

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:90%
you get an atomic bomb--

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.344 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely true.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.926 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: The smaller
you go, the more subtle

00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
you go in the structure,
the more power it has.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.145 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
subtle energy is so--

00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.309 align:middle line:84%
And not only that--
color and light.

00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
very pure frequencies.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And doing a hypnotic induction
with someone who's already

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
been traumatized through
frequency bypasses

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.636 align:middle line:84%
the resistance of the
mind anyway to say,

00:12:21.636 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to hypnotize me.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.937 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:12:23.937 --> 00:12:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I hear everything you say.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going anywhere.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:90%
The thing that people do.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You've just bypassed
all that by using

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:90%
this incredible technology.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So you've set people
into this state of grace

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:90%
to look around and experience.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations on that.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I love what you're
doing with that.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, I was
just following the--

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's beautiful.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: --course.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:41.841 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:41.841 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:90%
So going back into it.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at
the culture at large,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:84%
sexually, you talk
about a sacred wound

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that this culture
and many others have.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Actually, I
was teaching a workshop

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
at a retreat center
in Austin, Texas.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was having
dinner with someone

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
who was teaching another
workshop at the same time.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.636 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
noticed people who

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:84%
work with people's wounding
often have wounds of their own.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:90%
So she said, what's your wound?

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And she really stopped me cold.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.637 align:middle line:90%
I went, gee, I don't know.

00:13:13.637 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I've done all of
this processing work.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've had personal
sexual traumas and so forth.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly I went, oh my god.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the wound that is the
split between sexuality

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't really put words
around that until that time.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But I know that was
profound for me.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
profound in the culture.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's in Eastern culture.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.895 align:middle line:90%
It's in Western Christianity.

00:13:40.895 --> 00:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
It's somehow we can't be
both embodied and sexual

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and have that raw life
force vitality operating us

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy pleasure.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Hedonism.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to be spiritual,
you have to be above that.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.415 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:13:57.415 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It's all of it.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
People talk about
being one with God.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are God.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.454 align:middle line:90%
And so it's all of it.

00:14:07.454 --> 00:14:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about what happened then,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:84%
historically, that helped put
that wedge between our body

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the time-- and
you speak about this, I know.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
time of the elevation

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
of the mind among the
Greek philosophers.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Many of whom were
gay at the time.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It was largely known that
most of the great philosophers

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.587 align:middle line:90%
were homosexual.

00:14:29.587 --> 00:14:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But it really doesn't
matter, because they probably

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:90%
enjoy sex too at the time.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking only
about the woman part.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, first of
all, they elevated the psyche

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:90%
over the soma.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.304 align:middle line:90%
The soma is the physical.

00:14:43.304 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And the psyche,
for them, was more

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.495 align:middle line:84%
of the mental, spiritual
aspect of life.

00:14:46.495 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:90%
They kind of combined those.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And the psyche was
definitely elevated.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's really the
masculine and the feminine.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So the soma was
the feminine, which

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
is the physical, which
is the emotional.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the feminine,
menstruation and childbirth.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Sort of the, quote, messy
side of life, emotions

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:90%
and physicality.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
was-- and I'm not

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
going to who thinks-- that
was the beginning of misogyny.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But this was also happening
in Eastern cultures.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I heard a female Tibetan
monk speak of this.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying in Eastern
cultures, the same thing.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to reach
Nirvana or Samadhi

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
or whatever your
tradition calls it.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:90%
That that's a better.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.272 align:middle line:90%
You transcend the physical.

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To elevate
beyond the physical world.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: As if the
physical isn't also

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:90%
an expression of the God force.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine is--
and I mean the feminine

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:90%
within men and women.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking
feminine, not woman.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:84%
The feminine is rooted in
the emotions, the intuitive

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
understanding of what
is in the environment,

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and the physicality.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.299 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when we
deny that aspect of self?

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:07.715 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
the repercussions

00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:90%
of it thousands of years later.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And so
that's where the split.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about the
Madonna-whore complex.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.556 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to
back it up a bit?

00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Or do you feel comfortable--
I don't know if you do this.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Backing it up a
bit to Pagan times,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:84%
when the feminine was a little
more-- not a little more.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Was fully honored.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, there
was more balance then.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a scholar in Wicca
or Paganism and so forth.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was nature-based,
as I understand it.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And the vital life
force of nature.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Nature has its birth,
growth, and death cycles.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And so do we, as
a part of nature.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.195 align:middle line:84%
And sexuality is
just an expression

00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:90%
of that vital life force.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.485 align:middle line:84%
And it was honored, and
feminine was revered.

00:16:52.485 --> 00:16:55.547 align:middle line:84%
And the Goddess was often
revered in these cultures.

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.724 align:middle line:84%
And so here we go, we go
through these other periods

00:16:58.724 --> 00:16:59.890 align:middle line:90%
a couple thousand years ago.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
We fall into a state of the
patriarchy, which almost

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.410 align:middle line:84%
went hand-in-hand with
misogyny, just the way it was.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:90%
The female was demoted.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything feminine,
the feminine aspect

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
of self, man and
woman, was demoted

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
to an inferior, as you say,
rather messy kind of business.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So now what happens
when you bring religion

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:90%
into the picture?

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
just exacerbating it.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Christianity
certainly does that.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of evidence
that Jesus was married,

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:84%
but nobody will-- Christianity,
the whole virgin thing

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.080 align:middle line:90%
is really emphasized.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:84%
He came from a virgin,
and she didn't have sex.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:10%
In Catholicism, the
Virgin Mary is revered.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, Judaism, a
man having sex with his wife

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:10%
is performing a mitzvah.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually, I think, less
of an issue in Judaism, as far

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.625 align:middle line:84%
as what I've noticed,
than in Christianity--

00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
of the other--

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.969 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --and a lot
of the other religions.

00:18:05.969 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is
someone who speaks

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:84%
about this in another way,
though, and someone I think

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:90%
is wonderful.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.793 align:middle line:90%
Rocco Errico.

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We love him.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:90%
He's an Aramaic scholar.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:10%
And he really shines a
totally different light

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.120 align:middle line:10%
on the original teachings,
or the original scriptures,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:10%
that became the Bible.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:90%
What is this book?

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:90%
God, Sex, and the Bible.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I don't know if
that's a book, but he talks--

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He talks about it.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I took a
three-day workshop with him.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
God, Sex, and the Bible.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.229 align:middle line:90%
And he teaches clergy.

00:18:33.229 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know he does.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about his
reflection of sex-- God, sex,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:90%
and the Bible.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, first of
all, he's pretty convinced

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that if it wasn't
mentioned in the Bible

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus wasn't
married, it's almost

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:84%
assumed that he would be,
because all men of that age

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.612 align:middle line:90%
were married.

00:18:52.612 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:84%
It just wouldn't
have been an issue

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
that you would write about.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it was part of
the rabbinical tradition, too.

00:18:58.655 --> 00:18:59.655 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Right, right.

00:18:59.655 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him, though.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.195 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, do you see sex
as a gateway to the divine?

00:19:03.195 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Sex is divine.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
We are God expressed, or
pressed out into human form.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And sexuality is God
pressed out into human form.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.826 align:middle line:90%
And I went, yes!

00:19:15.826 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, Rocco!

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Another score for Rocco.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.488 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: We don't
have to use sex

00:19:19.488 --> 00:19:21.510 align:middle line:84%
to get there, although
I think it helps

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:90%
us tap into the awareness of it.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:90%
But we're already here.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.425 align:middle line:84%
We're already God pressed
out into human form.

00:19:29.425 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:90%
And I love that term.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.633 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that term, too.

00:19:31.633 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that's not
how most people feel.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.897 align:middle line:90%
Most people feel shut down.

00:19:34.897 --> 00:19:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Most people
who are spiritual are

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.920 align:middle line:90%
trying to get there.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
part of the problem.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Is that they're trying to
get to a spiritual state.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.385 align:middle line:84%
And they think, then,
they have to override

00:19:48.385 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:90%
some of the physical.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a common thing.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking about
the larger historical cycle,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot will say now that
we've really kind of maxed out

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
on the masculine
emphasis in the culture.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:90%
What we're doing to the planet.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And that we're starting
to tip the scales

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and moving more
into the feminine

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.697 align:middle line:84%
and gradually moving toward
a more balanced state.

00:20:12.697 --> 00:20:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
interesting, because when

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.240 align:middle line:84%
you look at the
reflections around us

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in terms of activism, the first
thing we're trying to recover

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:90%
is the Earth.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Man and woman alike are
trying to recover the Earth--

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:84%
the greatest physical
expression that we're

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:84%
experiencing besides
our own bodies.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:90%
So it is.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
We are putting emphasis back
onto the material world.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really kind of
troubling misinterpretation

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that has occurred, to denigrate
the material world when

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
we as souls have
chosen to incarnate

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:84%
into physical vehicles to
have a physical experience

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.370 align:middle line:84%
blended with the true nature
and bliss of the soul itself.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
doing is taking

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that into the sexual form,
or the sexual relationship

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:90%
between two individuals.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
the transcendent part,

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.971 align:middle line:90%
really, as a spiritual journey.

00:21:04.971 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: It really is.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And from very early on
in this relationship,

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I just said, making
love is like prayer.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like my spiritual practice.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And really deeply fulfilling,
sort of spiritually connected

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:90%
lovemaking is so healing.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think if more and more
people were to experience this,

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that it's part of the
healing of the planet that

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:90%
has to take place.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.560 align:middle line:90%
And it has a spillover effect.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.476 align:middle line:84%
It has a spillover
effect in families.

00:21:43.476 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Look where kids get
their sexual information.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:90%
The internet and their friends.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.877 align:middle line:84%
But if they've got
modeling-- they

00:21:53.877 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
don't have to see their
parents making love.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:84%
They get the vibe if parents
have a great sex life.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:90%
It spills over.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
The energetics of it spill
over into the family.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:90%
And it models in the family.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And it also spills over
into their work lives.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
People have more
energy and vitality

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
for sharing whatever their
passion and purpose in life

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
is when they have
a great sex life.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think it spills
over into the community.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:90%
It's like as Gandhi said.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to start with yourself.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Be the change.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Save the planet, save your--

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and even
on a quantum physics level,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:84%
it's becoming fairly
well understood--

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and HeartMath Institute is doing
some really interesting stuff

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
with it, and the Global
Coherence Initiative.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
That the human emotional
field is intimately

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:84%
intertwined with the
emotional field of the Earth.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has its
own emotional grid.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Those energies are
completely mixed together.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
the Earth when you

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
have a species that are
shut down and repressed

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.987 align:middle line:84%
and blocked on their most
innate spiritual levels?

00:22:59.987 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: That's a
really good point.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can't
release on those levels.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:84%
That stagnates the
entire relationship

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
of the matrix between
Earth and human.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Which is its own part
of the galactic complex.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're talking about
this, what I'm hearing you say

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm feeling
is that you're

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
looking at people who have
moved beyond these blocks,

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and who have released the
deepest part of themselves

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.454 align:middle line:84%
through this
physical experience.

00:23:27.454 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.057 align:middle line:90%
But it's an ongoing process.

00:23:30.057 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I don't think you
just like release them all

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:90%
and then you have great sex.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I think it's
an ongoing process,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and it's layers.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I don't
know a person who

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.731 align:middle line:84%
can grow up in Western culture
without some kind of wounding.

00:23:44.731 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:10%
That's why I think
it's so important

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:10%
to have these
anti-bullying activities.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.580 align:middle line:10%
Because these little
things can block us.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:10%
Being told to shut up
too many times as a child

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:10%
will block us here.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
That's so connected to
our sexuality, actually.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You talk about that.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.511 align:middle line:84%
The pelvis and the jaw are
related to one another.

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Energetically
and anatomically.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:10%
Any physical therapist will tell
you that the pelvis and the jaw

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:10%
are related.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:10%
Singers who, when their throats
are constricted, they're often

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:10%
told to relax their PC muscles.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:90%
And it helps open the throat.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And energetically, the second
chakra, the sexual energy,

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:90%
the creativity, it's the polar.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly number wise,
but it's related to the jaw.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we are shut down in
our verbal self-expression,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:90%
our truth-telling.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
As a child, kids are often
able to see human relationship

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:90%
dynamics, or they can comment.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:90%
They speak the truth.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.894 align:middle line:90%
And grown-ups don't like that.

00:24:54.894 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And so they're often
told that they are wrong.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
That what they observed or
interpreted is inaccurate.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:90%
They stop trusting themselves.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.704 align:middle line:84%
And they're often told to shut
up, be quiet, not be heard.

00:25:06.704 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is shutting down

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.124 align:middle line:84%
your potential sexual
experience before you're even

00:25:11.124 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:90%
in kindergarten.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Absolutely.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of that, because
I was a talker, and still am.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But I got told to be quiet a
lot by teachers and counselors

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a real block.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:10%
And so if we can't
express ourselves,

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:10%
then when we start to, it
feels really vulnerable.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:10%
And if you make a foray into
self-expression and somebody

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:10%
doesn't like it, then it's like,
ooh, I'll never do that again.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And that causes us to contract.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like an energy pipeline.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.450 align:middle line:84%
You can have physical
orgasms and so forth

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:90%
and have that kind of pleasure.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:10%
But if you're really going
to feel the full vital life

00:25:54.220 --> 00:26:00.870 align:middle line:10%
force flowing through us, and
that whole physical, emotional,

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:10%
spiritual integration,
then we've

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:10%
got to get that pipeline freed
up, and the energy flowing.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's a profoundly--

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
profound, but it--

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --fantastic
experience.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a great
deal of maturity.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.325 align:middle line:84%
That this whole subject of
being truthful and honest,

00:26:20.325 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:84%
which is the basis
of trust-- and we'll

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
go into the trust
factor in a little bit,

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:90%
and what lack of trust does.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
We first talked about a moment
ago holding back our truths.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we actually
start sharing our truths?

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we're a
conflicted species.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of stuff
that should be shared.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.240 align:middle line:84%
However, it's always
at the risk of loss.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
It's at the risk of
damaging your relationship,

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:90%
maybe losing the relationship.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So people live in
these devitalized zones

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:90%
of compromise.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.115 align:middle line:90%
And that is the basis--

00:26:54.115 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: That's a
good way of putting it.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:56.294 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:56.294 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's the basis of
a lot of relationships.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.794 align:middle line:84%
You love certain things
about your partner.

00:27:01.794 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
There are other things that
are really untenable to having

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.935 align:middle line:90%
this open, juicy relationship.

00:27:05.935 --> 00:27:06.810 align:middle line:90%
You can't mention it.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.749 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk about it.

00:27:08.749 --> 00:27:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: There's
always a tradeoff.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.950 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:19.051 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there are
ways to communicate.

00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Blurting things out
at inappropriate times

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.641 align:middle line:84%
or at stressful
times is probably not

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:23.515 align:middle line:90%
a great way to start.

00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And starting with an
atomic bomb is probably

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:90%
not the best way to start.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So developing a
practice of being

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
truthful about how
you feel and how

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
various things that
your partner does

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.939 align:middle line:84%
might affect you so that they're
aware of the impact of things

00:27:45.939 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:90%
that are happening.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Or starting to share the way
that-- just your real feelings.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.730 align:middle line:10%
Or sexually, maybe,
what would be helpful

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:10%
for you to enhance
your pleasure.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.027 align:middle line:90%
People are terrified--

00:28:00.027 --> 00:28:00.818 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:28:00.818 --> 00:28:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --of talking
about that sort of thing.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So then, when you get
to bigger issues--

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.170 align:middle line:84%
if you start practicing,
you get to bigger issues,

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.210 align:middle line:84%
you've got a relationship
foundation to work with.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But if there are things that you
want to share with your partner

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and it really does
risk the relationship,

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
then you have to decide,
well do I prefer--

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
judgment about this.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:84%
There are situations where-- do
I prefer to stay in a situation

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:33.770 align:middle line:84%
where we maintain the family
in one household, where there's

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of security,
where we maybe we've

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.600 align:middle line:84%
got a business
partnership of some kind

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.330 align:middle line:90%
as well, whatever it is.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:10%
Am I willing to sort of
throttle some aspect of myself

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:10%
in exchange for that?

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:10%
Whereas the other side of it
might be to take the chance,

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:10%
and you may or may
not get through it.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.434 align:middle line:84%
If it's a big deal, like
infidelities and so forth.

00:29:00.434 --> 00:29:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't know for sure if
you're going to get through it.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.099 align:middle line:84%
Some relationships get better
after that sort of thing

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
because it's cathartic.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:07.876 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:10.755 align:middle line:84%
And if they get the proper
assistance, the processing.

00:29:10.755 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:90%
But not always.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:90%
It can be the end.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, well, is
it more important to me

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
at this stage in
my life to be free?

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean free
from the relationship.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Free from--

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In terms of
that static quality.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.625 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --holding
myself back.

00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Free from not being myself.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:90%
To be free to be myself.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Is it more important to be
free, to be self-expressive,

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:90%
to be honest and truthful?

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And then suffer whatever the
consequences are and work it

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:90%
out the best we can.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And there is no right
answer for everything.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.444 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, there is not.

00:29:43.444 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:84%
It depends also on Maslow's
hierarchy of needs.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:10%
What is our hierarchy of needs
at a given phase of our lives?

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:10%
And it might be when we're in
our '20s, we need that freedom,

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.720 align:middle line:10%
and just to dowse around
and see who we are.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we go into
the next phase,

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.810 align:middle line:84%
where maybe we
need that security.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe when
that phase is done,

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe we need to, now that
we've put it all together

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and finished some of the tough
years and the child-rearing,

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe we need to have that
really fulfilled expression.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But you know,
that freedom in the 20s

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is not the same freedom
as it can be later.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, exactly.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: Because it can
be freedom like freedom

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:10%
to have lots of
relationships or go travel

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:10%
around the world or
play gypsy of whatever.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:10%
But it's not necessarily the
freedom to, first of all,

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:35.570 align:middle line:10%
even recognize and own who
you are and what you feel

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.427 align:middle line:10%
and what you want to
express, and the freedom

00:30:38.427 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:10%
to express those deeper
aspects of yourself.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.885 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, the
wisdom isn't there.

00:30:41.885 --> 00:30:45.129 align:middle line:84%
Usually the development isn't
there yet on a spiritual level.

00:30:45.129 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of the younger kids coming
in are coming in more lit up.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But up until this
period of time,

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.137 align:middle line:84%
most people aren't that lit
up spiritually in their 20s.

00:30:52.137 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was saying the term
dowsing around for ourselves.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Just trying to figure
out what we are,

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:90%
what we want to do next.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.431 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But speaking of
Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:30:59.431 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
he speaks of ecstatic or
mystical or transcendent

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.637 align:middle line:84%
And he, as well as some
other people-- maybe

00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:11.220 align:middle line:84%
you want to get into
this later, so we

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:11.900 align:middle line:90%
don't have to get into this now.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, go ahead.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But he
talks about what

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.955 align:middle line:84%
he's noticed is
that, first of all,

00:31:17.955 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
he noticed the most common
triggers of these kinds

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
of experiences
are music and sex,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and sex being the most profound
of them, the most common.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:10%
And that he
associated people who

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:10%
have evolved more on
the personal development

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.150 align:middle line:10%
level of the hierarchy
of needs tend

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:39.732 align:middle line:10%
to be more inclined to have more
frequent ecstatic or mystical

00:31:39.732 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:10%
experiences in general.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not speaking
of just sexual.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So as we get older, all of
these things come into place.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We always
think that in your 20s

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:84%
is when sex is at the top
of the hierarchy of needs.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
transcendent sex

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.564 align:middle line:84%
isn't exactly the same thing
you're looking for your 20s

00:31:57.564 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
as you might be looking
for later in your 40s,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.032 align:middle line:90%
50s, 60s and so forth.

00:32:01.032 --> 00:32:02.532 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: Wow, if
we only-- if we'd

00:32:02.532 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:10%
known when we were-- if
the young folks only knew,

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.624 align:middle line:10%
they would be looking
forward to getting older.

00:32:07.624 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was possible.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.920 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we
beat ourselves up,

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and we beat each
other up, and go

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
into these states of
mistrust, distrust.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And when there isn't
trust at the basis, what's

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:84%
kind of the best
you can hope for?

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And then dealing with
your hypnotherapy clients,

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.410 align:middle line:84%
you had to deal with
trust issues all the time.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the
beginning of how you

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:84%
start releasing these deep,
deep-seated-- sometimes

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:84%
from past lives,
even-- trust issues.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I really think
that trust and freedom

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.335 align:middle line:90%
go hand in hand.

00:32:37.335 --> 00:32:40.250 align:middle line:84%
That you can't have
freedom without trust.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And as there's more trust,
freedom just naturally occurs.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Freedom to express yourself,
freedom to be yourself,

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.810 align:middle line:84%
freedom to allow others in
your realm to be themselves.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Allowing.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Freedom is allowing and trust.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And expressing
that, again, I

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
keep coming back to the
word genuine maturity.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not talking about age.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
self-responsibility,

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.216 align:middle line:84%
being able to handle the
truth of another person.

00:33:11.216 --> 00:33:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's
something about you

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that is not working
for them, and you

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
have to be able,
with an open heart,

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:90%
to show up and hear that.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Not just express yourself,
but to hear it in return, even

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.184 align:middle line:84%
if it's painful,
and not run from it.

00:33:24.184 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
always the balance.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Agony and the ecstasy is a
great way of expressing it,

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:90%
because it's always both.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.240 align:middle line:84%
It may not be both
simultaneously exactly.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But there can also be at certain
ecstasy within the agony.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.660 align:middle line:84%
There are people that seek
out painful situations because

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.910 align:middle line:90%
of the intensity of it.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.615 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But I
think we all want--

00:33:48.615 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
we all want it.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think more and more there
is an attraction to intensity.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.812 align:middle line:84%
I think this is why that
whole Fifty Shades of Grey--

00:33:57.812 --> 00:33:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We want
peak experiences.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.769 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: We want
peak experiences.

00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why people get

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.315 align:middle line:84%
into even pain as an
intense experience,

00:34:06.315 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:90%
and often cathartic for people.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People
learn through pain.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:90%
Humans learn.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But I
don't recommend always

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:84%
seeking out painful experiences
and relationships just

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.100 align:middle line:90%
to have the intensity.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.832 align:middle line:84%
But just recognizing that that
can be part of the process.

00:34:22.832 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
mentioned a moment ago

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.050 align:middle line:90%
the Fifty Shades of Grey series.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the demographic for that
is mostly younger women, right?

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Soccer moms.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.889 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Soccer moms.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.820 align:middle line:90%
20s, 30s, 40s?

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.477 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: 50s.

00:34:38.477 --> 00:34:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:39.239 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even 50s?

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.381 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Oh yeah.

00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:90%
The interest in the books, yes.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even into-- OK.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.574 align:middle line:84%
But doesn't it skew
heavily female?

00:34:46.574 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:48.901 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:48.901 --> 00:34:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking
at this fellow Christian

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and this relationship he
has with this young girl,

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:84%
what is it women are so
enthralled about and craving

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.452 align:middle line:84%
that has just shot
this series of books

00:35:01.452 --> 00:35:02.410 align:middle line:90%
into bestseller status?

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:03.826 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well
it's interesting I

00:35:03.826 --> 00:35:07.880 align:middle line:84%
was on a panel to discuss
this very question.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.013 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot of
different views on that.

00:35:11.013 --> 00:35:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think part of it relates
to this craving intensity.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Romance novels have
been big forever,

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and this just took it to
the next level of intensity.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:10%
I think, although
there is this--

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:10%
I think it relates a little
bit to the fact that--

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.150 align:middle line:10%
speaking of men and
women now specifically,

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:10%
heterosexual
relationships-- women who

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:10%
are strong or successful
or both in their work life

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.890 align:middle line:10%
often have learned to use a
lot of their masculine energy

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:53.620 align:middle line:10%
to succeed in a
male-dominated culture,

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:10%
or a masculine-energy culture.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
times, people think

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.716 align:middle line:84%
that's how they
want to be in bed.

00:35:59.716 --> 00:36:01.850 align:middle line:84%
But often what
they really want is

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.490 align:middle line:84%
a man who can be more
masculine than they are in bed

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and allow them to let go
into their feminine side.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:14.430 align:middle line:90%
But in a bubble of trust.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So you know that that person's
going to take care of you

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.080 align:middle line:90%
So there's safety.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they get
into that in the books.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Frankly, I couldn't get
through the first one.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't either.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: I was so bored.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was bored
and the writing was bad

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.935 align:middle line:84%
but I thought, wow, these
girls are really into it.

00:36:29.935 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But I
understood the point.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
there is something

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.935 align:middle line:84%
about sort of the extreme of
what I was just describing.

00:36:37.935 --> 00:36:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Being able to let go.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.206 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there were
boundaries that were set up.

00:36:40.206 --> 00:36:41.581 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: There
were boundaries.

00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:42.540 align:middle line:90%
There was trust.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And there was eroticism
and intensity.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:50.941 align:middle line:84%
And so all of those things are
very alluring and very great

00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:51.440 align:middle line:90%
interest.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the other side, I
have a list of subscribers,

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.406 align:middle line:84%
so I sent out a little
email blast saying,

00:36:56.406 --> 00:36:57.600 align:middle line:90%
have people read this book?

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:90%
What's your experience of it?

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.815 align:middle line:84%
Some were saying, oh,
they brought back ideas

00:37:00.815 --> 00:37:03.840 align:middle line:84%
to their relationship and
having fun and good stuff.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And others were
saying that it was

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:90%
very sort of re-traumatizing.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they'd had
experiences that

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:90%
were not put together as well--

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were unwitting.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.593 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: They were unwitting,
or they got into relationships

00:37:17.593 --> 00:37:20.267 align:middle line:84%
where there was a
lot of harm done.

00:37:20.267 --> 00:37:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Not to say physically, but
emotionally, psychologically.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very
wounding to read that,

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.850 align:middle line:84%
or they heard friends
reading it and they

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.760 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to touch it
because they got triggered just

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.730 align:middle line:90%
hearing about it.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's the full spectrum.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.550 align:middle line:10%
But on the other
hand, it does open up,

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:38.370 align:middle line:10%
I think, more
permission for people

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:42.940 align:middle line:10%
to explore their own
boundaries, to push their edges.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
always a good thing.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's just
in your own mind

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:84%
or to experiment
physically and emotionally.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.780 align:middle line:90%
But to push your edges.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
expansive by nature

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.720 align:middle line:90%
rather than contractive.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that makes sense.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:56.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit
ago, we were talking

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
about how once you kind of
have a definition of what you

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.410 align:middle line:84%
desire, and you've started
your spiritual development,

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:08.110 align:middle line:84%
you can go into these more
ecstatic states of lovemaking.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes with a mature
relationship and partner.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
wounding often,

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and the lack of trust where
people in relationships

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.460 align:middle line:84%
wound each other
with harsh words,

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe infidelity that breaks
trust, or other things

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.369 align:middle line:84%
that break trust,
even money situations.

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:27.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people find that
it's really, really difficult

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to then re-open up, as you
did in the honeymoon phase,

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.290 align:middle line:90%
to that person.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go outside
the marriage or whatnot.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what
happens in first encounters.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.430 align:middle line:90%
One night stands.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: Actually, I think
we'll talk about this later,

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.560 align:middle line:10%
but Jenny Wade, who wrote the
book-- who did the research

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.900 align:middle line:10%
and wrote a book called
Transcendent Sex,

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:52.361 align:middle line:10%
When Lovemaking Opens the Veil
is the subtitle of the book.

00:38:52.361 --> 00:38:53.860 align:middle line:10%
Basically, it was
on people who have

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:10%
these unplanned, transcendent,
altered state experiences

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.100 align:middle line:10%
during lovemaking.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.795 align:middle line:10%
And not necessarily
the same as what

00:39:02.795 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:10%
I'd call ecstatic lovemaking,
but I was having those two.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.160 align:middle line:10%
And she found that
a lot of people

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:10%
had these experiences
with somebody

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.010 align:middle line:10%
that was on a one-time basis.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:20.140 align:middle line:10%
And everybody in 91 case studies
interpreted their experience

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:10%
as being spiritual in
nature, interestingly.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But the one-night stands I
found particularly interesting,

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:84%
because I think if you can
create momentary trust,

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.060 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing to lose.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.634 align:middle line:84%
It could be dangerous,
but you're not

00:39:35.634 --> 00:39:37.300 align:middle line:84%
going to lose a
relationship because you

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.520 align:middle line:90%
didn't have one to start.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
the biggest fear,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.985 align:middle line:90%
is losing the relationship.

00:39:40.985 --> 00:39:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fear of
losing what you have.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.600 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: So I
think there's moments

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.910 align:middle line:10%
that are sort of outside of
your normal life sequence

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:54.500 align:middle line:10%
where people just allow
themselves to go for it.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:10%
It like, OK, I don't
care what happens.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.490 align:middle line:84%
This person I'm never
going to see again.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:02.470 align:middle line:84%
If they think I'm weird and
gross or I make weird sounds

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:05.346 align:middle line:84%
or I want to do things that
I've never done before,

00:40:05.346 --> 00:40:06.595 align:middle line:90%
so what if they don't like me.

00:40:06.595 --> 00:40:09.084 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever have
to see them again.

00:40:09.084 --> 00:40:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:90%
So the freedom comes with that.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And also there has been no
broken trust that has occurred.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.520 align:middle line:84%
There are no old
patterns playing out

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.540 align:middle line:90%
between the two people.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.220 align:middle line:90%
It's innocent, in a sense.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.678 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And
there's a difference

00:40:21.678 --> 00:40:24.810 align:middle line:84%
between relationship
trust and sexual trust.

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I have to
comment that I got this

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.650 align:middle line:84%
from Alex Allman, a
colleague of mine.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:90%
He does sexuality work as well.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And he draws an analogy to you
can have a partner that you

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:84%
trust with your life and
to help raise your kids

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and financial trust and
all these kinds of things.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.690 align:middle line:84%
But you might not
have a great sex life.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And he likens it to
an airplane pilot.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.330 align:middle line:84%
When you're flying
in an airplane,

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.334 align:middle line:84%
you don't care if you
have a great relationship

00:40:53.334 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:90%
with that pilot.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:84%
You don't care if he's
got a good family life.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't care if
he's good financially.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But you want to know that he
knows everything and is very

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:06.740 align:middle line:84%
well experienced and
trustworthy flying that plane.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And you want to know
that if the going gets rough,

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.699 align:middle line:84%
he's going to make
it to the tarmac.

00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:84%
He's going to get
that plane down

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:84%
in the worst
conditions possible.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's something about
somebody who has confidence

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:23.847 align:middle line:84%
and you can trust them to take
care of your needs in bed.

00:41:23.847 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And not necessarily
take care of your needs.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But you can explore
your own edges--

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let
me ask you a question.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back just a sec.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --and feel that
you can trust that person to--

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But is
the airline pilot

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:84%
the one that you trust
in bed or out of bed?

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: In bed.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In bed.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Because it's
situation-specific.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.676 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: So you can have a
one-night stand with somebody

00:41:44.676 --> 00:41:51.961 align:middle line:10%
that just exudes this
sexual trustability in bed.

00:41:51.961 --> 00:41:55.850 align:middle line:10%
They might have
terrible relationships.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:10%
They might not be
able to make a living.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.635 align:middle line:10%
They might screw up everything
they do outside the bedroom.

00:42:00.635 --> 00:42:03.010 align:middle line:10%
And you might never want to
have a relationship with them

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:10%
for many reasons, because
they wouldn't even

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:10%
be trustworthy to
show up for a date.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:14.580 align:middle line:84%
But in this time and place,
they exude a trustworthiness,

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.210 align:middle line:84%
a confidence, a skill
set and knowledge

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.890 align:middle line:90%
that you can [SIGHS] sink into.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.173 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is OK.

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:27.185 align:middle line:90%
I can explore my boundaries.

00:42:27.185 --> 00:42:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can bring
that into your relationship

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.600 align:middle line:84%
with someone that you love,
that's just fantastic.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And someone that
you have relationship trust

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:34.420 align:middle line:90%
developed with.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes, yes.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the best,
I think, in terms

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.850 align:middle line:84%
of our sort of
tendencies to want

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:41.360 align:middle line:90%
to have it all in one package.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also,
this whole thing

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.482 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to have it
all in one package--

00:42:46.482 --> 00:42:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe, in a certain
sense, in fairy tales.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.050 align:middle line:10%
I believe that the
honeymoon doesn't

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:10%
have to last-- I mean that
the honeymoon doesn't have

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.800 align:middle line:10%
to end, in terms of that
innocence and openness

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.390 align:middle line:10%
and kindness to one another.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely
do not believe--

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.440 align:middle line:84%
this is my belief system--
that you can necessarily

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.807 align:middle line:84%
expect one person to
be all things to you.

00:43:05.807 --> 00:43:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: No.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is just--
I mean, our grandmothers

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.010 align:middle line:84%
weren't looking
for ecstatic sex.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.843 align:middle line:84%
They were hoping someone
would pay the bills

00:43:12.843 --> 00:43:15.382 align:middle line:84%
and maybe not be violent
with them and not run away.

00:43:15.382 --> 00:43:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And s stick
around long enough

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:18.790 align:middle line:90%
to help them raise the kids.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was a different
expectation than now.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.950 align:middle line:84%
We want to have
everything, men and woman.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Our expectations
out of our lives

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:30.150 align:middle line:84%
have expanded so much, but
our cultural expectations

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.779 align:middle line:84%
of relationship are still
pretty much the same.

00:43:32.779 --> 00:43:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the old age.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.486 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:43:34.486 --> 00:43:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You find the one, and
theoretically live happily ever

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.400 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.110 align:middle line:90%
But look at the--

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
working out too well.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: --family structure.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
families aren't that.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And people feel guilty
for not doing that,

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.880 align:middle line:84%
or they feel wanting
and longing that they

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.500 align:middle line:90%
haven't done that properly.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet you start to see,
sort of under the radar,

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:59.280 align:middle line:84%
more and more explorations of
different kinds of relationship

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:84%
dynamics to start to
suit people's needs.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it may, in fact,
be pretty unrealistic to

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.315 align:middle line:84%
expect all of that
from one person.

00:44:07.315 --> 00:44:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: We don't expect
that from our friends.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not even logical.

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:84%
No, we don't expect
that from anything else.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:13.618 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: We may have
one friend that we

00:44:13.618 --> 00:44:16.540 align:middle line:84%
go to foreign films with, and
somebody else that we go hiking

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and skiing with, because
they don't necessarily

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540 align:middle line:90%
have the same interests.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So we just get a
variety of friends.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet we dump
this on our partner,

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.040 align:middle line:84%
expecting them to be the 100%
package, everything to us.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking off
camera, that oftentimes

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.230 align:middle line:84%
these ecstatic sexual
relationships may not

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:34.510 align:middle line:84%
be during the period
of time that you're

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:36.780 align:middle line:84%
raising your children
and really just looking

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:90%
for stability in life.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to rock
the boat at those times.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And that begs a
lot of questions,

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.000 align:middle line:90%
meaning what's that mean?

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean you
have an affair?

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean you
learn to be creative,

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.140 align:middle line:84%
create a new kind
of relationship

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.930 align:middle line:90%
by mutual agreement?

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.734 align:middle line:84%
Or does it mean you end up
going off with someone else

00:44:54.734 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:90%
and getting a divorce.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It means a lot of
different things.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: It does mean a
lot of different things.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.130 align:middle line:84%
People work out
different things.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Some work out open
marriage agreements

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.067 align:middle line:90%
with very specific boundaries.

00:45:04.067 --> 00:45:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Others are secretive
and have affairs,

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:09.060 align:middle line:84%
which I think starts to
shut down that trust factor

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.000 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And guilt.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Guilt feeds into it.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not
good for ecstatic sex.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.546 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: I was very lucky.

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I had a great partner
for raising my family,

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and we did a lot of-- we had
a great, fun life together.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Travel and family.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And we actually had
an excellent sex life.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.480 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was normal.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.940 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize that--

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
anything beyond.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.976 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: No, I didn't even
realize that everybody wasn't

00:45:35.976 --> 00:45:38.780 align:middle line:84%
having a decent sex
life in their marriages.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was just normal.

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.290 align:middle line:90%
I was very fortunate.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But then, when
the impulse for me

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.649 align:middle line:84%
to bring my spiritual
life, which I'd always had,

00:45:50.649 --> 00:45:52.440 align:middle line:84%
more and more into the
relationship-- which

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.910 align:middle line:90%
was sort of not there.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.570 align:middle line:84%
That was a piece
that I was having

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.653 align:middle line:84%
to share with my friends,
because it wasn't really

00:45:57.653 --> 00:46:00.020 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship in the
way that I'd always wanted.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.675 align:middle line:84%
But I had so much
in the relationship

00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:03.240 align:middle line:90%
that I could get that elsewhere.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
yearning, then, I sensed

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that it was somehow available
through that intimacy

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and sexuality but couldn't
go there with this person.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.342 align:middle line:90%
That was a challenge.

00:46:16.342 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think a lot of
people can relate to that.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:19.049 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:19.049 --> 00:46:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Now let's move into-- well,
you were talking about earlier

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that part of the pathway to
our own higher consciousness

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and these expansive,
peak experiences

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:30.800 align:middle line:90%
can also be through sex.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.180 align:middle line:84%
That sex is the doorway
to the peak experience.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes vice versa.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed a
wonderful man a number of times

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.050 align:middle line:90%
named Hank Wesselman.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.960 align:middle line:10%
And Hank,
anthropologist by trade,

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.810 align:middle line:10%
but really he's started
making his path in life

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:51.280 align:middle line:10%
as a result of having
these ecstatic experiences.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.640 align:middle line:10%
He was making love with
his wife, who they dearly

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.770 align:middle line:10%
love each other.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And afterward, he
would find himself,

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:84%
after going through
that blissful state,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.760 align:middle line:84%
in this altered state
of consciousness,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.820 align:middle line:90%
physically paralyzed.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Almost like people talk about
in abduction experiences.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:09.670 align:middle line:84%
His body would become
paralyzed, but his consciousness

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:10.610 align:middle line:90%
was awake.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, he was jettisoned
5,000 years into the future.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And that became the basis
of his original work

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that he made public, was life
5,000 years into the future.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:25.240 align:middle line:84%
This rich, fully-developed
life that he

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.765 align:middle line:84%
was living as his alternate
self 5,000 years in the future.

00:47:28.765 --> 00:47:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you look at
the time-space continuum,

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.830 align:middle line:84%
just collapse it,
now you could say.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But he said that that
doorway was always

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:36.840 align:middle line:84%
his sexual experience,
that would happen

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.080 align:middle line:90%
after making love with his wife.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And I know you know Hank, too.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.730 align:middle line:84%
You've taken workshops
from him and all.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.434 align:middle line:90%
What is your thought on that?

00:47:44.434 --> 00:47:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well,
he's the only one

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I know of that's had that
particular kind of experience.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Personally, mine have always
been during lovemaking itself.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Although in the research
Jenny Wade's done,

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:02.000 align:middle line:84%
she has a number of case studies
where people had experiences

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.970 align:middle line:84%
after sex, still lying together
in each other's arms, where

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.250 align:middle line:84%
they would then have an
altered state experience.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.759 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
work of Andrew Greeley.

00:48:11.759 --> 00:48:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Oh yeah.

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, he wrote a book called--

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It says
here, Ecstasy--

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Ecstasy--
A Way of Knowing.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I wrote it down.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:21.840 align:middle line:90%
A Way of Knowing.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.464 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:48:22.464 --> 00:48:27.640 align:middle line:10%
And he had also done
some surveys and research

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:32.770 align:middle line:10%
about people having ecstatic
experiences, by whatever sort.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number
of things that

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.590 align:middle line:84%
tend to stimulate
ecstatic experience.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Being in nature is one of those.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But he also noted that music and
sex, sex being the most common,

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.440 align:middle line:84%
was another trigger for
mystical experiences.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he wrote that his view
was that if people were having

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:55.830 align:middle line:84%
better sex, if they knew
more about having good sex

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:59.914 align:middle line:84%
and were having
more fulfilling sex,

00:48:59.914 --> 00:49:01.330 align:middle line:84%
that probably more
people would be

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.299 align:middle line:84%
having these
mystical experiences.

00:49:03.299 --> 00:49:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was just recently, when
I was trying to research him--

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.620 align:middle line:84%
the book's very hard
to get a hold of.

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.569 align:middle line:84%
But I was researching
him on the internet.

00:49:09.569 --> 00:49:10.360 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I discovered he's a
Roman Catholic priest!

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:14.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, like Rocco.

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:15.170 align:middle line:10%
This is interesting.

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:17.590 align:middle line:10%
A very unlikely source
of this information.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.060 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: I think he's probably
a bit of a renegade, though,

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.880 align:middle line:10%
because he's written
a number of novels

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.445 align:middle line:10%
and such about things
going on in the Vatican.

00:49:23.445 --> 00:49:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does he write
it under a pen name

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:25.330 align:middle line:90%
or under his own name?

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Under his name.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: He's primarily
a novelist, apparently.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's pretty gutsy.

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.182 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:49:31.182 --> 00:49:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So now we get back.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.960 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning of
our conversation,

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.410 align:middle line:84%
we were talking
about frequencies.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And in lieu of
our being able to,

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.780 align:middle line:84%
without maybe quite
a lot of therapy,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.300 align:middle line:90%
transform our relationships.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.801 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we're
in a relationship

00:49:47.801 --> 00:49:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and we want to bring
it to the next level.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.810 align:middle line:84%
But you have your
relationship issues.

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:54.480 align:middle line:90%
You have your trust issues.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.920 align:middle line:84%
You have something that's a
wonderful ally for people,

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.150 align:middle line:84%
by way of working
with frequencies.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.650 align:middle line:84%
That, as you said in the very
beginning of the conversation,

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:06.330 align:middle line:84%
can bypass certain judgments
and certain thought processes.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:08.184 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about that
just a little bit?

00:50:08.184 --> 00:50:09.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
another conversation

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and go into some great
depths on this subject.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:13.357 align:middle line:90%
But we have some time.

00:50:13.357 --> 00:50:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: OK.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about the music?

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: So I
already mentioned

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
light and color.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And the therapist--
I was actually

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.882 align:middle line:90%
also working with these wands.

00:50:28.882 --> 00:50:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What are the wands?

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Call them
the golden wands.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.860 align:middle line:84%
It's called this
Inner Quest system.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.825 align:middle line:84%
And they're literally these
wands, about 12 inches long,

00:50:36.825 --> 00:50:37.780 align:middle line:90%
and you hold them.

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And they contain powdered
gemstones and crystals

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and inert gases, and they're
connected to a little base

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:49.050 align:middle line:84%
with a battery in it that puts
out a charge to activate them.

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:52.665 align:middle line:84%
And the formulas relate
to different chakras.

00:50:52.665 --> 00:50:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And I found them really powerful
in working with clients.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:59.952 align:middle line:84%
I would say, we'd be
dealing with something,

00:50:59.952 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:84%
so where are you
experiencing this?

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And they'd feel it
in their stomach.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:04.465 align:middle line:10%
And then they'd go, I'm kind
of feeling it in my throat.

00:51:04.465 --> 00:51:06.850 align:middle line:10%
And I'd say, well, put
the wand on your throat.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Put the number two wand
on your throat, whatever.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this one
woman, her head went back,

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and she let out this
bloodcurdling scream.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.105 align:middle line:84%
I thought the sirens
were going to come.

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:18.966 align:middle line:84%
She goes, [GASPS] that's been
wanting to get out for so long.

00:51:18.966 --> 00:51:22.440 align:middle line:90%


00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And these are also
wands that could

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:28.580 align:middle line:84%
be inserted vaginally
or rectally.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with people
in a very discreet manner,

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.120 align:middle line:84%
under blankets and letting
themself insert and so forth.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And working with them
to process out rape,

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.010 align:middle line:90%
molestation issues and so forth.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:43.892 align:middle line:84%
I had one woman who
was vaginally numb.

00:51:43.892 --> 00:51:45.850 align:middle line:84%
She could feel the pressure
during intercourse,

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:48.730 align:middle line:84%
but she could never feel
any other sensations.

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And after one session with that,
she went home to her partner.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:53.630 align:middle line:90%
She was so excited.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.089 align:middle line:84%
She called me, goes,
I could feel it all!

00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:57.130 align:middle line:90%
She was having great sex.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:51:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So again, that's another
level of frequency.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.401 align:middle line:84%
The guy who created
those wands had also--

00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and this was a
number of years ago--

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:12.780 align:middle line:84%
had put energetic
frequencies onto music CDs.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not putting sound on.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It's energy that is
carried on the sound.

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It would be like white
noise, watery sounds.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been
experimenting with this stuff.

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And you want a little
story about that?

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:27.997 align:middle line:90%
We love stories.

00:52:27.997 --> 00:52:29.621 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I had a
psychologist friend,

00:52:29.621 --> 00:52:31.590 align:middle line:84%
really my mentor with
the light and color.

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.730 align:middle line:84%
He's in Texas, and he
and another colleague

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:37.090 align:middle line:84%
were visiting from
visiting the Bay Area.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:40.360 align:middle line:10%
So my partner and I had
them over for brunch.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.180 align:middle line:10%
My partner was living
on a yacht at the time.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.530 align:middle line:90%
These CDs, I had eight.

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:47.627 align:middle line:84%
One was first chakra,
second chakra, moving up.

00:52:47.627 --> 00:52:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And then that there was
an eighth one, which

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.850 align:middle line:84%
was like psychedelic,
psychotropic.

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It would infuse
psychotropic energies.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So we had on the vitality
one, which was for chakra.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.070 align:middle line:90%
And it was just background.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was making brunch
and we were chatting.

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, I
just couldn't get this food

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:06.310 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And people's conversations
were just like falling apart.

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:12.024 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't follow
a train of thought.

00:53:12.024 --> 00:53:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, it's
kind of odd, you know?

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And then my partner, he admitted
that he'd-- the CDs all sounded

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.930 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.138 align:middle line:90%
They were all the same water.

00:53:21.138 --> 00:53:23.670 align:middle line:84%
He had switched to
the psychedelic one.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was so affirming.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wow.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.180 align:middle line:90%
There is something to this.

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.060 align:middle line:90%
So fast forward.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.570 align:middle line:84%
A number of years
later, I'm trying

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.010 align:middle line:90%
to create music for lovemaking.

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And all I knew to put in
it, that I knew what to do,

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:41.700 align:middle line:84%
was brainwave entrainment,
to help take people

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:46.890 align:middle line:84%
into the ideal state for
ecstatic lovemaking, which

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.300 align:middle line:84%
has been, through
research, shown

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.870 align:middle line:90%
to be the theta brainwave state.

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.167 align:middle line:90%
Which is slower than alpha.

00:53:52.167 --> 00:53:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a state in which we're
usually asleep and dreaming.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.125 align:middle line:84%
But it's a state
where we have the most

00:53:56.125 --> 00:54:01.790 align:middle line:84%
access to our heightened
physical perception,

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:05.170 align:middle line:84%
the most access to
our emotional states,

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:10.270 align:middle line:84%
a more holistic awareness
of your own needs

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:12.620 align:middle line:90%
and your partner's needs.

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
people who are experts

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.050 align:middle line:84%
in brainwave entrainment say
it's the ideal state for orgasm

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was just trying to
get brainwave entrainment

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:23.490 align:middle line:90%
into this music.

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Once it was all produced,
I was introduced

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:28.210 align:middle line:84%
to a man who had worked with
the guy who created the wands

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and created this other
music I had been using.

00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:33.540 align:middle line:90%
He did mastering, CD mastering.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to master CDs
before you produce them.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And he had been
working for seven years

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.000 align:middle line:90%
on these energetic frequencies.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They had been partners
in some way before.

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:44.530 align:middle line:84%
They had gone their
separate ways.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.113 align:middle line:84%
He'd been working
on these frequencies

00:54:46.113 --> 00:54:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to connect sexuality
and spirituality.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, bingo.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And I'd been
working for all these years.

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:54.520 align:middle line:90%
So it was a perfect marriage.

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.720 align:middle line:10%
So then we set forth to get--
there were energy frequencies

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.879 align:middle line:10%
that he'd been developing
into my music CDs.

00:55:01.879 --> 00:55:04.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And then there's
a little back story to that.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:07.300 align:middle line:10%
Because as you were searching
for musicians to do this,

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.734 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people
didn't want to be

00:55:08.734 --> 00:55:10.025 align:middle line:10%
associated with the notion of--

00:55:10.025 --> 00:55:11.230 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: Well, the
musicians didn't care.

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:13.646 align:middle line:84%
But it was the people-- I
needed the brainwave entrainment

00:55:13.646 --> 00:55:15.200 align:middle line:90%
expert to help me create it.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.076 align:middle line:84%
Because we couldn't
use the binaural beats,

00:55:17.076 --> 00:55:18.450 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
wear headphones

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:19.700 align:middle line:90%
when you're having sex, right?

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:21.403 align:middle line:84%
Unless you've got
a headphone fetish.

00:55:21.403 --> 00:55:24.396 align:middle line:90%


00:55:24.396 --> 00:55:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there were three
top guys in the country who

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:30.090 align:middle line:84%
were the brainwave
entrainment specialists.

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And they knew it
was the right thing.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:38.172 align:middle line:84%
But they were trying to make
their own inroads into the--

00:55:38.172 --> 00:55:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you talk
to the Monroe Institute,

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:41.421 align:middle line:90%
for example at all?

00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: No, I didn't.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.206 align:middle line:84%
But I talked to
Jeffrey Thompson, who's

00:55:44.206 --> 00:55:46.080 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of these
brainwave entrainment CDs

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.466 align:middle line:84%
and does the gamma and all
the different brainwave stuff.

00:55:48.466 --> 00:55:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to him
personally, met with him.

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.580 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yeah!

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Theta is it!

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:55.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the ultimate
state and we need

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.910 align:middle line:84%
to make an orgasmatron
and blah blah blah.

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:59.300 align:middle line:90%
He was totally into it.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.390 align:middle line:84%
But he said, we're
working so hard

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to get legitimacy in
this field that sex

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:06.175 align:middle line:90%
would put it over the edge.

00:56:06.175 --> 00:56:07.258 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Again that fear.

00:56:07.258 --> 00:56:09.645 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And the guy
that I worked with actually

00:56:09.645 --> 00:56:13.329 align:middle line:84%
had worked with Andrew Wylie
on his Sound Mind Sound Body

00:56:13.329 --> 00:56:13.870 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:14.869 align:middle line:90%
And I can tell you this.

00:56:14.869 --> 00:56:17.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not a secret.

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:18.835 align:middle line:84%
He created the
brainwave tempo map

00:56:18.835 --> 00:56:20.835 align:middle line:84%
for the musicians, helped
me find the musicians.

00:56:20.835 --> 00:56:23.565 align:middle line:84%
He was instrumental in so
much of the whole system

00:56:23.565 --> 00:56:24.900 align:middle line:90%
that I developed.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.556 align:middle line:84%
But at the last
minute, when it got

00:56:26.556 --> 00:56:29.055 align:middle line:84%
to putting the credits on the
packaging, he said, you know--

00:56:29.055 --> 00:56:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No can do.

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Because
it was OK before.

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But then he just,
at the last minute--

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --this whole fear
factor, this perception factor.

00:56:35.548 --> 00:56:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: The
sexuality, I think

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:39.266 align:middle line:90%
we'll just leave that off.

00:56:39.266 --> 00:56:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:41.599 align:middle line:84%
But this is pervasive
within our culture.

00:56:41.599 --> 00:56:43.973 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: It's part of the
whole thing about our culture

00:56:43.973 --> 00:56:45.541 align:middle line:84%
and the sexuality
being considered

00:56:45.541 --> 00:56:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the dark side, that's sort of
the dark side of the feminine.

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, as
you're talking,

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:51.396 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about
something else.

00:56:51.396 --> 00:56:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is totally unrelated.

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know,
maybe something

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:56.308 align:middle line:84%
that-- we're going to
have another conversation

00:56:56.308 --> 00:56:58.175 align:middle line:84%
and really get into
those brainwaves,

00:56:58.175 --> 00:57:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and get into the different
states of consciousness.

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Just so you're aware of that.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But just as a little finish
on this conversation,

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.970 align:middle line:84%
something to check out is
there's something called TRE.

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember
what it means exactly.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.310 align:middle line:10%
It might have to do with
trauma release something.

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:15.060 align:middle line:10%
That I interviewed a
fellow named David Berceli

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.520 align:middle line:10%
a number of years ago on this.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.200 align:middle line:10%
It's become quite a big deal,
dealing with troops coming back

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.390 align:middle line:10%
from Afghanistan.

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:23.340 align:middle line:10%
Trapped trauma in
the body, and shaking

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.720 align:middle line:10%
it out through a process
very simple, very primal.

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Shaking it out.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm understanding that
some really cool things are

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:35.260 align:middle line:84%
happening around sex with
that release process, too.

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: I'm not surprised.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just wanted to turn
you onto that for just a sec

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.910 align:middle line:84%
before we sign off
for this conversation.

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:43.993 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, there's
a lot of movement in sex,

00:57:43.993 --> 00:57:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and it can help
vibrate it all out.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Alone or with a partner.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is the thing.

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Just really briefly, before
we end the conversation.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.710 align:middle line:84%
How do you recommend people
begin-- because there's

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:00.270 align:middle line:84%
another week or two before
they'll see conversation two--

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:02.970 align:middle line:84%
start releasing that
trauma that's in the body?

00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Just we only have
a minute or two.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.905 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, this music
is actually very helpful.

00:58:07.905 --> 00:58:10.760 align:middle line:84%
You can start working
with it on your own,

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.920 align:middle line:84%
if you want to create a
really safe little bubble

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.770 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, through
self-pleasuring.

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:15.728 align:middle line:90%
Listening to the music.

00:58:15.728 --> 00:58:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I've had a number of
people say that they

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:20.730 align:middle line:84%
get this music-- the music
is called Love Unbound.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It's part of my Music
for Better Sex product.

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:30.050 align:middle line:84%
But they want to work with
moving their sexual energy

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and tapping into
their sensuality.

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And it can really
be very gentle.

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I've yet to hear anybody have
any negative experiences.

00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it's possible
that you can.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.840 align:middle line:90%
But I just haven't had that.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.490 align:middle line:84%
People are generally
saying, women

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:50.760 align:middle line:84%
are having easier orgasms
and multiple orgasms

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.620 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:54.036 align:middle line:84%
People are finally tapped more
into a spiritual connection

00:58:54.036 --> 00:58:54.960 align:middle line:90%
with their partner.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Easier communication about
sexuality with their partner.

00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: More spontaneity
and freedom during lovemaking.

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So all these things
are happening

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.450 align:middle line:84%
as a result of this
brainwave entrainment.

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:10.210 align:middle line:84%
What I call auditory
pheromones infused into music.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the mind
can be our greatest ally

00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:14.390 align:middle line:84%
or it can be our greatest
enemy during sex.

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:16.755 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to pick that
conversation up and look

00:59:16.755 --> 00:59:18.237 align:middle line:90%
at having mindful, mystical sex.

00:59:18.237 --> 00:59:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Out of the head,
and into the heart and body.

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Ellen.

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.
