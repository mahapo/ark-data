00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.347 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: How many
times have you told yourself

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:16.116 align:middle line:10%
you're going to do things
differently, stop bad habits,

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.786 align:middle line:10%
or start a new endeavor, only to
disappoint yourself in the end?

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.655 align:middle line:10%
Well, you can stop
beating yourself up.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.757 align:middle line:10%
Today's guest, Rob
Williams, will tell you

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:27.294 align:middle line:10%
that it's nearly impossible to
change behavior from your will

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:30.397 align:middle line:10%
alone, because your behavior
is driven by the subconscious

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.031 align:middle line:10%
mind.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.234 align:middle line:84%
Unless you go inside and begin
to reprogram the subconscious,

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:36.904 align:middle line:84%
your attempts to change
will likely be challenged.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.572 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've probably
heard this before.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.674 align:middle line:84%
What you may not know
is that there is now

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
a fast and powerful
way to do this,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.145 align:middle line:84%
through what is known
as PSYCH-K. Rob,

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:90%
it's good to see you again.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.648 align:middle line:10%
I think last time
we sat together

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.049 align:middle line:10%
and did this was
seven years ago.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.183 align:middle line:10%
>>ROB WILLIAMS: I think so.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:50.717 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's been a while.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.351 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.687 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's been a while, and
a lot has changed in your field

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:54.454 align:middle line:10%
since then.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.623 align:middle line:84%
But the bones of it
are still proving

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:59.226 align:middle line:84%
to be incredibly powerful
and effective every day.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.995 align:middle line:10%
So, what I'd like
to do is talk to you

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.563 align:middle line:10%
about the inception
of it, for those

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.832 align:middle line:10%
who are not familiar
with PSYCH-K,

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.835 align:middle line:10%
and then I would like to move
into some of the really, truly

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.271 align:middle line:10%
stunning experiments you've
been conducting recently.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.005 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Mm-hm.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:12.506 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:15.642 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So first of all, we
have interviewed Bruce Lipton

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.777 align:middle line:10%
here, on one of our
other shows, as have I,

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:19.545 align:middle line:10%
and I met you two together.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.482 align:middle line:84%
Now let's start
out as a platform.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's start there.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.186 align:middle line:84%
How did you and Bruce find
an overlay in your work,

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.854 align:middle line:84%
and then the
inception of PSYCH-K

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.556 align:middle line:84%
as well, all rolled
into one answer?

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.291 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's
a wonderful story.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.894 align:middle line:10%
I like telling it, so
I'm glad you asked.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:35.628 align:middle line:10%
Bruce and I met
about 20 years ago.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.898 align:middle line:10%
He's a dear friend of
mine and a colleague,

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.466 align:middle line:10%
so we ended up working together.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.702 align:middle line:10%
After we met, found out why
we should work together,

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.704 align:middle line:10%
for about 14 years.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:45.771 align:middle line:10%
And the meeting process
itself was interesting,

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.174 align:middle line:10%
because Bruce and
I were speakers

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:48.508 align:middle line:10%
at the same conference.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:51.144 align:middle line:10%
It was in the Rocky Mountains,
actually, in this area.

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:54.146 align:middle line:10%
And Bruce had done his
normal firing everybody up,

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.783 align:middle line:10%
and giving them new
information about genes,

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.485 align:middle line:10%
and they're not a
victim of their genes,

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.587 align:middle line:10%
or the genetic makeup in
any way, shape, or form--

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.422 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Which some people
were not happy to hear.

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:04.291 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: Well, yeah,
yeah, a lot of people

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:84%
weren't happy to hear it,
mostly mainstream science,

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.762 align:middle line:84%
because they were all invested
in the Genome Project, which

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:90%
turned out to be a bust.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.264 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Almost a bust, really.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:11.498 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:12.566 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Very much so.

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:15.035 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And because, that's
not determining who we are.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:15.769 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Right.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.371 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't determine who we are.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.573 align:middle line:10%
The genes, essentially,
are like, Bruce would say,

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:20.407 align:middle line:10%
a blueprint.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.242 align:middle line:10%
They're waiting for
something to happen.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.578 align:middle line:10%
They don't have
self-emergent properties,

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:25.912 align:middle line:10%
he would say, as a biologist.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.181 align:middle line:10%
In other words, they don't
turn themselves on and off.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.916 align:middle line:10%
There's no on and
off switch for genes.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.451 align:middle line:10%
The really important
thing about that

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:10%
is that he had come
to the conclusion

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.522 align:middle line:10%
that what does turn
genes on and off

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.391 align:middle line:10%
are actually your
belief systems.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.826 align:middle line:10%
And these belief systems are
not just the conscious belief

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.763 align:middle line:10%
systems, but more importantly,
the subconscious ones.

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:45.232 align:middle line:10%
And Bruce-- I was
stunned to hear him

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:10%
as he was giving
his presentation.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.103 align:middle line:10%
I was to follow the presentation
in this particular conference.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.172 align:middle line:10%
And he's talking about all
these wonderful things,

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.974 align:middle line:10%
and I'm thinking, how
does a biologist know

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:54.941 align:middle line:10%
about any of this?

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.144 align:middle line:10%
What's that got to do with--
what's biology got to do with--

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:58.145 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Classical
biology, yeah.

00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:58.478 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.747 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, it
seemed really odd to me.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.583 align:middle line:10%
But I was fascinated that he was
talking about belief systems.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.519 align:middle line:10%
And so he gets to the
end of his presentation,

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.921 align:middle line:10%
after he's made this
wonderful connection,

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.023 align:middle line:10%
and frees everybody from
this idea that we're just

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.659 align:middle line:10%
victims of our genes,
and he says, so,

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.294 align:middle line:10%
what you really need
to learn how to do

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.662 align:middle line:10%
is change your beliefs.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:18.698 align:middle line:10%
So lots of hands, of course,
go up, and people are saying,

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.401 align:middle line:10%
well, Dr. Lipton, Dr. Lipton--
how do you change your beliefs?

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.569 align:middle line:10%
And he says, I don't know.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.336 align:middle line:10%
I'm a biologist.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.005 align:middle line:10%
I have to go now.
[LAUGHTER] So--

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:25.806 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Part two.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.107 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:28.975 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.644 align:middle line:10%
Bruce was on his
way out the door.

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.379 align:middle line:10%
He finished, and then
it was a conference

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.147 align:middle line:10%
where I was up next to speak.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.416 align:middle line:10%
And before he got to the
door in the back of the room,

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:40.454 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, I want to thank
Dr. Lipton for enlightening us

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:43.156 align:middle line:10%
about how it is that we
get to be who we are,

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.959 align:middle line:10%
and that beliefs are a key
part of changing who we are,

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.961 align:middle line:10%
and aiming in a different
direction in our life.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.163 align:middle line:10%
And I said, and I'm going
to show you how to do that.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.799 align:middle line:10%
Well, you could almost hear
the soles of his feet--

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.502 align:middle line:10%
his shoes skidding to a
stop, because he was not

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:10%
interested in whatever
was next, if it

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.605 align:middle line:10%
didn't have to do a biology.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.574 align:middle line:10%
But he stopped, and he
turned around, I saw him

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.409 align:middle line:10%
in the back of the
room, and our eyes met.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.311 align:middle line:10%
And I said, so,
thank you, Bruce,

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:05.879 align:middle line:10%
for introducing the
idea of beliefs,

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.247 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to
show you how you

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.116 align:middle line:10%
can change those in
a matter of minutes.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:10.984 align:middle line:10%
Well, instead of
leaving the room,

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.752 align:middle line:10%
he found a seat in
the back and sat down,

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.386 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.856 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: And he watched
a demonstration of PSYCH-K,

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:18.425 align:middle line:10%
of the belief change
work that I do.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.894 align:middle line:10%
And he watched a woman
go from abject terror

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:23.396 align:middle line:10%
of public speaking-- because
we had her greatest fear there.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:26.266 align:middle line:10%
There were some 120 or so
people in this conference,

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:10%
and there was her fear.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.802 align:middle line:10%
It might have been
a room of snakes,

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:10%
if you had a snake phobia.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.638 align:middle line:10%
But her fear was people.

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:35.075 align:middle line:10%
And being able to stand up in
front of them, be comfortable,

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:37.144 align:middle line:10%
and speaking her mind.

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:39.546 align:middle line:10%
But we did this process,
took about 10 minutes to do.

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:40.914 align:middle line:10%
Bruce watched the process.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:44.651 align:middle line:10%
The woman went from shaking
on the stage, with me,

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.086 align:middle line:10%
as I said, why
don't you introduce

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:47.554 align:middle line:10%
yourself a little
bit to the group?

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:48.855 align:middle line:10%
Well, she couldn't do that.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.024 align:middle line:10%
So we did the process.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:53.493 align:middle line:10%
And right after this
process was completed,

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.662 align:middle line:10%
she starts to say, well, I
really do feel different.

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:56.963 align:middle line:10%
And she said, it's very odd.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:57.264 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel--

00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:58.498 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Did she take over?

00:04:58.498 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah--
she took over.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.334 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, she did.

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:10%
I thought I was going to have
to yank her off the stage,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.572 align:middle line:10%
because she's kind of
walking up and down,

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:07.541 align:middle line:10%
and talking to people,
because she's liberated.

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:10%
Now she's free to be
in this relationship

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.678 align:middle line:10%
with this mass of people.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:12.712 align:middle line:10%
It was wonderful.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.748 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, that was
very validating for you,

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:15.815 align:middle line:10%
with Bruce watching.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:19.152 align:middle line:84%
Because that was to become the
beginning of a wonderful love

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:19.653 align:middle line:90%
affair.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.654 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: Well,
that's very true.

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:21.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Business love affair.

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:23.323 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.325 align:middle line:90%
We very much respect each other.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.993 align:middle line:84%
It's like a mutual
admiration society.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.763 align:middle line:10%
And we learned, right
then, that his story

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.131 align:middle line:10%
stops where mine begins.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:32.566 align:middle line:10%
And we thought,
there's a fit here.

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:34.201 align:middle line:84%
People should have
the whole story.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:35.802 align:middle line:10%
This is how you get
to be how you are,

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:38.338 align:middle line:10%
but if you want to change it,
you can rewrite that software.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.906 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
when I first met you.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:42.242 align:middle line:84%
And this was at the Science
and Consciousness Conference

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:44.711 align:middle line:84%
in Santa Fe, when those were
still going on, years ago.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.213 align:middle line:84%
And you two were
paired at the time.

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:50.584 align:middle line:84%
And I was just so fascinated
by the tandem information

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:51.484 align:middle line:90%
that was being given.

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.587 align:middle line:84%
Which is how we ended up
doing our last interview.

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:56.289 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to just interject
something, because we're

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.194 align:middle line:84%
going to go into the basis of
PSYCH-K. When you're talking--

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
when Bruce is talking,
about the genes-- you know,

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.565 align:middle line:84%
I would debate this
with people at the time,

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.499 align:middle line:90%
and say, no, really.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.735 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, well,
how come is it--

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.204 align:middle line:84%
why is it that all
the women in my family

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.507 align:middle line:84%
have had breast
cancer, for example.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:17.711 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the story
gets really interesting.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.447 align:middle line:84%
To me, that is the argument
people keep bringing up.

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:22.082 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but my father
had a heart attack,

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:24.184 align:middle line:84%
and his father had
a heart attack.

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:27.287 align:middle line:84%
There is a different kind of
inheritance than just genes.

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:28.555 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Precisely.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.324 align:middle line:10%
There's a belief
system inheritance,

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:34.127 align:middle line:10%
you might want to call it, that
essentially-- if you grow up

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:36.162 align:middle line:10%
in a similar situation,
with similar beliefs,

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.498 align:middle line:10%
like your parents got their
beliefs from their parents--

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.233 align:middle line:10%
it's a hand-me-down,
generational thing--

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.801 align:middle line:10%
they don't even know
they're doing it.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.036 align:middle line:10%
It's not the parents' fault.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.504 align:middle line:10%
That's what they
think reality is.

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:46.573 align:middle line:10%
That's how they
think life works.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.908 align:middle line:10%
So they simply inform their
kids, quite automatically.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.244 align:middle line:10%
We talked about the subconscious
mind being so powerful.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.078 align:middle line:10%
It is.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.047 align:middle line:10%
It just says, OK, this
is the way life is.

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:55.015 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't question it.

00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:57.817 align:middle line:10%
It runs that program,
over and over and over.

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.586 align:middle line:84%
So you hand-- along
with the genes,

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:02.088 align:middle line:84%
you hand down beliefs, and
perceptions, and vanities,

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and values to your kids.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.292 align:middle line:10%
And as it turns out,
what Bruce is saying,

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:07.594 align:middle line:10%
in that magnificent
moment when--

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.896 align:middle line:10%
it comes at the end of
his program, and he says,

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.398 align:middle line:10%
you're not a victim
of your genes.

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:13.233 align:middle line:10%
Essentially, your
beliefs actually

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:15.035 align:middle line:10%
activate your genetic makeup.

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:17.237 align:middle line:10%
And then so if you have a
different set of beliefs,

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:18.972 align:middle line:10%
those genes never get activated.

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.573 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And this
is even in utero.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:23.043 align:middle line:84%
I remember one case he wrote
about in the original book,

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:25.945 align:middle line:84%
"Biology of Belief," that
really stunned me at the time.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.848 align:middle line:84%
It was about an
embryo-- a fetus--

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:32.419 align:middle line:84%
that was growing up in a violent
environment inside the mother.

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:36.122 align:middle line:84%
And that sent a signal to
the genetic development

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:40.927 align:middle line:84%
of that fetus, that baby, to
have a thickening of the skull.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:43.897 align:middle line:84%
To protect itself against
any physical violence

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:45.498 align:middle line:90%
that might be coming its way.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.133 align:middle line:84%
As, apparently, may
have been happening

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.336 align:middle line:90%
with the mother or siblings.

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:51.604 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember that
other part of the story.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:55.108 align:middle line:90%
That is so profound.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:56.776 align:middle line:10%
And this is what you
were talking about.

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:59.079 align:middle line:10%
And this can express
itself, what--

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:00.847 align:middle line:10%
when you're looking
at disease, we're

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:04.117 align:middle line:10%
looking at-- there is
always a-- what's it called?

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:07.053 align:middle line:84%
Psychoneuroimmunological
root, right?

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.188 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Big word, yeah.

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:09.356 align:middle line:90%
The mind/body connection.

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:10.824 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:11.424 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:14.761 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about that, and
how you developed PSYCH-K.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Well, PSYCH-K got
developed in 1988, actually.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.067 align:middle line:10%
In '88, '89, over the course
of a two or three month period.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:23.603 align:middle line:10%
I had reached a period in
my own personal growth,

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:27.173 align:middle line:10%
in my own search for
something that would really be

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.076 align:middle line:10%
an effective catalyst for
change, in my own life,

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.678 align:middle line:10%
as well as in other people's.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.212 align:middle line:10%
And so, I'd gotten
to the point where

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:35.648 align:middle line:10%
I've taken a lot of courses
in different things,

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.015 align:middle line:10%
things you would
recognize today.

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:39.852 align:middle line:10%
NLP, and hypnotherapy,
and Reiki,

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.921 align:middle line:10%
and Touch for Health, and
educational kinesiology,

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:45.091 align:middle line:10%
and just on and on and on,
investigating and searching,

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.726 align:middle line:10%
as deeply as I
could and as broadly

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:48.895 align:middle line:10%
as I could to find
out what really works.

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:52.332 align:middle line:10%
What really gives people the
tools-- that are transferable,

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:53.733 align:middle line:10%
not just as a
therapist, because I

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.969 align:middle line:10%
was doing private
practice therapy.

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:58.505 align:middle line:10%
And I'd gone to the University
of Colorado, gotten a master's

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:01.207 align:middle line:10%
degree in counseling, learned
the traditional mechanisms

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:10%
for therapy-- insight-based
talk therapy, primarily.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.678 align:middle line:10%
Essentially going
back in the past,

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.415 align:middle line:10%
figuring out what happened,
who you blame, forgive them,

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:10.083 align:middle line:10%
and then, supposedly,
you're just

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.385 align:middle line:10%
supposed to be able to change
everything then, and move

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:10%
into the future.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.155 align:middle line:10%
I didn't find that
that was the case.

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:19.192 align:middle line:10%
I found that insight alone was
seldom a sufficient condition

00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:10%
to make long-lasting changes.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.663 align:middle line:10%
So I kept looking
elsewhere for the answers.

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:26.666 align:middle line:10%
And, finally, came to a
place of frustration one day.

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean, so severely.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.803 align:middle line:10%
I was trying to put
together a workshop

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:31.504 align:middle line:10%
to teach something I
had already learned,

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:10%
and I was part of
doing this course

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.308 align:middle line:10%
in "educational
kinesiology," it was called.

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.876 align:middle line:10%
Today it's called
Brain Gym, mostly.

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.411 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
most common way

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:90%
people understand that process.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.515 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm putting
together this flyer,

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.684 align:middle line:10%
and I was making these
really ridiculous mistakes

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:45.251 align:middle line:10%
on the flyer.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.052 align:middle line:10%
Just little things.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.154 align:middle line:10%
There was a little
tiny box where

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:49.722 align:middle line:10%
you put the registration
information.

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:53.126 align:middle line:10%
Time, date, that sort
of thing-- location.

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:10%
And I just messed it up.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.261 align:middle line:10%
And this wasn't like me.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.629 align:middle line:10%
I'm a perfectionist, you know?

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.164 align:middle line:10%
I can make this right.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.265 align:middle line:10%
And I kept making mistakes.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:10%
I got madder and
madder at myself.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.304 align:middle line:10%
And finally, I just
stopped what I was doing.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:06.139 align:middle line:10%
I was really,
really angry inside.

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:09.476 align:middle line:84%
So I went outside-- this was in
December, in Denver, Colorado,

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:11.811 align:middle line:84%
where it was cold--
and I sat down,

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:16.216 align:middle line:84%
and I just clenched my
fists, and I said, "OK, God.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:18.785 align:middle line:10%
If you don't want me to do this,
what do you want me to do?"

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.387 align:middle line:10%
It was one of those moments
of, it's a rhetorical question,

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.555 align:middle line:10%
I didn't expect an answer.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:23.256 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:25.291 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: But in fact,
I got an answer, Regina.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.861 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beginning of
PSYCH-K. It was so amazing.

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:30.563 align:middle line:84%
I was, one moment, in
this state of rage.

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:34.834 align:middle line:84%
The next moment, I'm seeing
information in my head,

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.569 align:middle line:90%
like a teleprompter.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.104 align:middle line:90%
I could see the words.

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.439 align:middle line:10%
These weren't my words.

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:41.274 align:middle line:10%
But I was witnessing
these words.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:44.043 align:middle line:10%
So I ran back into the
house, out of the cold,

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:46.846 align:middle line:10%
and started typing what I saw
in my mind into my computer.

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:49.649 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And was this the
framework for the protocols

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:50.884 align:middle line:10%
that what became PSYCH-K?

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:51.251 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:52.852 align:middle line:84%
It was the very
first pattern, and it

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:55.221 align:middle line:84%
was a very-- of all the
patterns, and most of them

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:58.525 align:middle line:84%
are quite simple, but this
one was more complicated.

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:00.793 align:middle line:10%
There were 13 paired
statements of opposites,

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:05.064 align:middle line:10%
and the entire instructions
for using this process.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.166 align:middle line:10%
It just really stunned me.

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.335 align:middle line:10%
But there I was, looking
at something that I knew

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.104 align:middle line:10%
came through me,
but not from me.

00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:12.939 align:middle line:10%
So my intellect
didn't have a chance

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:15.708 align:middle line:10%
of being happy with
itself, and taking credit,

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:18.745 align:middle line:10%
but I was so humbled
by the experience.

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:20.213 align:middle line:10%
And so I looked at what it was.

00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:21.648 align:middle line:10%
I studied it.

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:22.982 align:middle line:10%
It seemed to make sense.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.417 align:middle line:10%
It had components
in it of things

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.085 align:middle line:10%
that I had studied
before-- a little of this,

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:28.221 align:middle line:10%
a little of that, and so
on-- but it was put together

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:29.756 align:middle line:10%
in a way I never
would have imagined.

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:32.025 align:middle line:10%
Nor would I have
conceived of on my own.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.294 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you had to go
through that self-sabotage

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:36.396 align:middle line:10%
before you would have ever
been frustrated enough,

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:39.632 align:middle line:10%
and how many of us go
through self-sabotage

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:43.469 align:middle line:10%
on a regular basis, trying to
stuff ourselves down some chute

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:45.705 align:middle line:10%
that we really
shouldn't be going down.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.208 align:middle line:84%
I thought of it as
self-sabotage in a way,

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.944 align:middle line:90%
but it's also self-education.

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.946 align:middle line:10%
I needed to see
everything that was

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:56.082 align:middle line:10%
available in that
area of self help,

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:59.619 align:middle line:10%
and I needed to be open
enough, in other words, sort

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:01.788 align:middle line:10%
of frustrated enough,
at one moment,

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:04.424 align:middle line:10%
to just surrender
the whole concept of,

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:07.126 align:middle line:10%
OK, I really can't figure
this out, what's going on.

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:10.496 align:middle line:84%
So what I said was, OK, God,
you don't want me to do this,

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:12.131 align:middle line:90%
what do you want me to do?

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:13.666 align:middle line:10%
In retrospect, I
look back and I say,

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.836 align:middle line:10%
there's that old adage of
ask, and you shall receive?

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:17.337 align:middle line:10%
I did.

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:18.571 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't very nice asking.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.773 align:middle line:10%
It was more accusatory.

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:23.843 align:middle line:10%
But nevertheless,
what was given to

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:25.478 align:middle line:10%
me was incredibly
interesting to me.

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.547 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You had to be that
frustrated to be that open.

00:12:27.547 --> 00:12:27.947 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Absolutely.

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:28.481 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.818 align:middle line:84%
So, now you're given the
bones of the protocols.

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:35.655 align:middle line:84%
How did you begin, and what
was the very basic concept?

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:90%
You said pairs of opposites.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.392 align:middle line:84%
Now let's start informing
us as to what that means.

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:40.093 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.894 align:middle line:84%
It didn't turn out to
be solely associated

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:90%
with pairs of opposites.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.733 align:middle line:10%
This particular pattern is
called a "core belief balance."

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:50.503 align:middle line:10%
Because it deals with things are
basic to our lives in general.

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.205 align:middle line:10%
Statements like,
"I want to live."

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:10%
And then its opposite,
"I want to die."

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.408 align:middle line:90%
I love myself.

00:12:55.408 --> 00:12:56.676 align:middle line:90%
I hate myself.

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:57.744 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:12:57.744 --> 00:13:02.115 align:middle line:10%
These paired opposites could
be accessed, or checked into,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.083 align:middle line:10%
at the subconscious
level of the mind,

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.618 align:middle line:10%
using what's called
"muscle testing."

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Kinesiology is the
brand name of it,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.123 align:middle line:84%
but muscle testing could be
used in a lot of different ways.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.557 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's
used nutritionally,

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:13.693 align:middle line:84%
and to test different
energy systems

00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:15.094 align:middle line:84%
in the body--
"meridian systems,"

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:16.396 align:middle line:90%
they're called-- and so on.

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:18.097 align:middle line:10%
But in PSYCH-K, we
don't use it that way.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:20.466 align:middle line:10%
We use it specifically
as a mechanism

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:23.002 align:middle line:10%
of checking for congruency
at the subconscious level--

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:24.937 align:middle line:10%
agreement or disagreement,
in other words--

00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:26.773 align:middle line:10%
about what something
you might say out loud.

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:29.342 align:middle line:84%
Something as simple as, if
you were part of a dyad,

00:13:29.342 --> 00:13:31.344 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working with you, you
would say, my name is Regina.

00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:33.212 align:middle line:84%
And we would muscle test,
to see if your subconscious

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.847 align:middle line:84%
mind agrees or
disagrees with that.

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.582 align:middle line:10%
One would hope it would agree.

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:38.117 align:middle line:10%
But then it gets
more interesting

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:40.586 align:middle line:10%
when you say something
like, I love myself.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:42.689 align:middle line:10%
People have spent years
in front of mirrors,

00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:10%
saying I love myself,
I love myself,

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.893 align:middle line:10%
and the voice that's coming
back in their head says,

00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:47.994 align:middle line:10%
no you don't, no you
don't, and besides,

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.929 align:middle line:10%
here are all the reasons
why you shouldn't.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:52.365 align:middle line:84%
So these are all programs
that we carry around,

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:54.367 align:middle line:84%
that oftentimes are not
worthy of who we are,

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:55.835 align:middle line:90%
or who we're becoming.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.071 align:middle line:10%
And that's where things
get real interesting.

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.173 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let me ask you
a question at this point,

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.108 align:middle line:10%
because there are
people, we all know

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:10%
people-- you know,
it's like, how

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.613 align:middle line:10%
do they do that-- that make a
decision-- I'm going to stop

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.450 align:middle line:10%
smoking tomorrow--
and that's it.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.584 align:middle line:90%
And they never smoke again.

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.419 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
say the same thing.

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:17.056 align:middle line:84%
Any behavior, any habit,
where they simply lay down

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:19.258 align:middle line:84%
the law with themselves,
and through will,

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:20.493 align:middle line:90%
are able to do it.

00:14:20.493 --> 00:14:22.495 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference
with someone

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:25.865 align:middle line:84%
like that versus the
rest of us, that struggle

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.301 align:middle line:84%
with these kinds of
habitual changes?

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:29.335 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Sure.

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.104 align:middle line:10%
My experience in
the last 25 years

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:32.972 align:middle line:10%
tells me that the real
difference, typically,

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:36.609 align:middle line:10%
is, there's very little, if
any, subconscious resistance

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:39.412 align:middle line:10%
to a conscious decision
one makes, and then

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:42.782 align:middle line:10%
uses will to change
their path in life.

00:14:42.782 --> 00:14:45.184 align:middle line:10%
But when there are a lot of
subconscious programs-- "sub,"

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:10%
by the way, means below,
so below the level

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.354 align:middle line:10%
of your conscious awareness--

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:49.021 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So you
don't know what it is.

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: You don't
know what it is.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:53.059 align:middle line:10%
You don't even know it's there,
except you see the effect.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.394 align:middle line:10%
It can turn into
being self-sabotaging.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.464 align:middle line:10%
It can turn into
being procrastination.

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:00.266 align:middle line:84%
It can be-- you're
just habituated

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:90%
to do this over and over again.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.102 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself
doing it before you're even

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:04.203 align:middle line:90%
consciously aware of it.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.538 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop it.

00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:08.941 align:middle line:10%
So, to me, what I found out was
the people that could change

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:12.378 align:middle line:10%
using, say, just insight-based
counseling and therapy,

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.013 align:middle line:10%
could change because
they didn't really

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:16.149 align:middle line:10%
have any resistance to
moving in that direction.

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:18.117 align:middle line:10%
What they needed was
information and a plan

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.418 align:middle line:10%
to move in that direction.

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.854 align:middle line:84%
But people who got the
plan, got the information,

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:24.257 align:middle line:84%
knew exactly what caused
them to be the way they were,

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:28.795 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't change, clearly had
self-sabotaging, self-limiting,

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:30.963 align:middle line:84%
beliefs at the subconscious
level of the mind.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.598 align:middle line:84%
And when those got
changed-- and that's

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.567 align:middle line:84%
the essence and
core of PSYCH-K--

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:35.968 align:middle line:84%
to be able to shift
those beliefs,

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:38.671 align:middle line:84%
write new software for
your own hard drive,

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and change the
printout of your life--

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.841 align:middle line:90%
that made a huge difference.

00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:43.409 align:middle line:84%
Because then,
everything was lined up.

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.778 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious beliefs
supported your conscious goals,

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's moving
in the same direction.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.682 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now
that you say that, when

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.284 align:middle line:84%
I think of the
people-- just a couple,

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:54.587 align:middle line:84%
off the top of my head--
those people have, usually,

00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:58.357 align:middle line:84%
a very clear way of living,
good, solid self-esteem.

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:01.427 align:middle line:84%
They also don't seem to be
dragging a lot of other issues

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:01.961 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:02.195 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Absolutely.

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:03.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that might
be indicative of what

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.398 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Usually so.

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:06.833 align:middle line:84%
If their lives are
pretty in order,

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:09.101 align:middle line:84%
they don't have a lot of
things that are bugging them,

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:11.737 align:middle line:84%
and what they really want to
do is just improve their life,

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:14.774 align:middle line:84%
generally, then, will power,
affirmations, or visualization,

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:17.844 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of positive
thinking will work.

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:19.612 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the vast
majority of people,

00:16:19.612 --> 00:16:22.114 align:middle line:84%
I'd say easily 80%
of the population,

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
doesn't do it that way,
and can't do it that way.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.588 align:middle line:84%
They are really internalized--
they have internalized--

00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:31.357 align:middle line:84%
many programs that don't allow
this ease of moving forward.

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:32.024 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:34.026 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing up
feeling defeated already,

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:36.963 align:middle line:84%
with their New Year's
resolution on January 1.

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:38.631 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm going to
make this resolution.

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.099 align:middle line:84%
It probably won't
work, but-- yeah.

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:41.467 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're
talking about,

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.501 align:middle line:90%
is that kind of thinking.

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.002 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.705 align:middle line:84%
Now, you had the
beginning part of it.

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:48.708 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a little
more expanded idea

00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:51.811 align:middle line:84%
of how you would implement
these protocols when you're

00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:53.346 align:middle line:84%
working with
someone, for example.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.981 align:middle line:84%
So people can get
a flavor for it.

00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:56.115 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Sure.

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.918 align:middle line:10%
It's really very
simple, logically.

00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:02.588 align:middle line:10%
It's very rational.

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.723 align:middle line:10%
The whole interaction
begins with,

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:06.224 align:middle line:10%
so why did you come today?

00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:07.894 align:middle line:10%
What do you want to
change in your life?

00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:10%
Why are you here?

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.996 align:middle line:10%
And so a person says,
well, I can't do this,

00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:12.698 align:middle line:10%
or this is happening in my
life, and I want to change it.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.401 align:middle line:10%
Very quickly in PSYCH-K,
we move to the future,

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:16.301 align:middle line:10%
instead of the past.

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.037 align:middle line:10%
Traditional therapy
takes you to the past,

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:20.205 align:middle line:10%
and says, well who did
what to whom, and when,

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:23.242 align:middle line:10%
and figures out how come you're
behaving the way you are.

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:10%
But the really
important thing here

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.112 align:middle line:10%
isn't how things have been.

00:17:26.112 --> 00:17:28.146 align:middle line:90%
It's how you want them to be.

00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So very quickly, anybody that's
a facilitator of PSYCH-K--

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.852 align:middle line:84%
and there are thousands of
people worldwide now doing

00:17:32.852 --> 00:17:34.954 align:middle line:84%
this work, and
over 40 instructors

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:36.722 align:middle line:84%
teaching it around the
world in workshops,

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:39.025 align:middle line:84%
so people can learn to
do this for themselves--

00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:42.561 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that moving towards
the future, and solutions,

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.665 align:middle line:84%
instead of wallowing in the
problems, is a huge first step.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:48.935 align:middle line:10%
Very critical to
re-framing and redirecting

00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:50.369 align:middle line:10%
your attention and intention.

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.204 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as you go
to this place of, well,

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.773 align:middle line:90%
what would a solution look like?

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:54.674 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:59.111 align:middle line:10%
For the longest time, I would
start these sessions like that,

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.613 align:middle line:10%
and the person
would tell me, well,

00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:02.682 align:middle line:10%
what's wrong, what's going
on, and I'd say, well,

00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:05.251 align:middle line:10%
if it didn't have to
be that way any longer,

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.186 align:middle line:10%
if we could do something
right here, right now,

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:10.189 align:middle line:10%
that would change that
forever, what would you

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:11.223 align:middle line:10%
like to see in your life?

00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:13.693 align:middle line:10%
What would you like
your life to be like?

00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:10%
And the most common
response was this.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.366 align:middle line:10%
They just stared like
a deer in headlights.

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:22.768 align:middle line:10%
They had never thought about
what they wanted instead--

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:23.169 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They just
knew what they wanted--

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:23.769 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: -- of
what they have.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:24.337 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: -- to get rid of.

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:25.805 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:27.773 align:middle line:10%
They were all
about the negative.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.442 align:middle line:10%
All about the limitations.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So of course that
reinforces that consciousness.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.111 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Of course it does.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.546 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thought by
thought, day by day,

00:18:33.546 --> 00:18:35.181 align:middle line:84%
year by year, you're
reinforcing it,

00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:37.516 align:middle line:84%
by remembering and involving
yourself in the past.

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Right.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.819 align:middle line:84%
Especially since
you've had no vision

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
of what you'd like
it to be instead.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.657 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as the facilitator
can help a person move from how

00:18:44.657 --> 00:18:46.258 align:middle line:84%
it's been to how
they want it to be?

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:46.759 align:middle line:90%
Boy.

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:49.528 align:middle line:10%
You're over halfway there
in any PSYCH-K session.

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:51.564 align:middle line:10%
Because at that point,
what you're going to do

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:55.134 align:middle line:10%
is take that information of
how they want the future to be,

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.969 align:middle line:10%
condense it down
into a statement that

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.638 align:middle line:10%
is designed, specifically,
to be internalized

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:01.507 align:middle line:10%
at the subconscious
level of the mind.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:02.875 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out
the subconscious

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:04.477 align:middle line:10%
doesn't think like
the conscious mind.

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.879 align:middle line:10%
So, we're having this
conversation right now.

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.647 align:middle line:10%
Mostly, the subconscious
mind would not

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:10.383 align:middle line:10%
have an idea of what
we're talking about,

00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:11.984 align:middle line:10%
because it thinks
very literally, almost

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.152 align:middle line:10%
like a five-year-old child.

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:16.222 align:middle line:10%
A precocious five-year-old, but
a five-year-old nevertheless.

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:10%
If you want to talk
to the subconscious,

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.126 align:middle line:10%
you have to talk in
very concrete terms.

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:24.764 align:middle line:10%
So once we could, how would I
say-- capsulize this intention,

00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:27.066 align:middle line:10%
which might be quite abstract,
about what a person wants

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.635 align:middle line:10%
in the future, into a
statement the subconscious can

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:32.304 align:middle line:10%
internalize, then,
then, we can enter

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:34.573 align:middle line:10%
one of the balance processes,
or the change processes,

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:34.974 align:middle line:10%
in PSYCH-K.

00:19:34.974 --> 00:19:36.142 align:middle line:10%
And there are numerous ones.

00:19:36.142 --> 00:19:37.276 align:middle line:10%
It's not one thing.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:39.345 align:middle line:10%
It's not, you just do
this, one size fits all.

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.379 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't work with therapy.

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:41.647 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't work with clothing.

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:42.314 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:45.184 align:middle line:10%
What you're saying
would not bode well

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.686 align:middle line:10%
for the entire industry
of talk therapy.

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you're continuing
to repeat, and then reinforce,

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
the feelings of the
past in talk therapy.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.328 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is really
a moving beyond that.

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:59.265 align:middle line:84%
Maybe people do this because
it's offering a friend.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:00.533 align:middle line:90%
Someone to talk to.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.701 align:middle line:90%
A comfort of some kind.

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it's
not a quick path

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.439 align:middle line:84%
to change, which is
why so many people seem

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:08.607 align:middle line:84%
to stay in therapy for
year after year after year.

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:09.208 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Right.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.876 align:middle line:10%
Therapy-- I will say
about talk therapy,

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.012 align:middle line:10%
that its advantage
and its utility

00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:17.416 align:middle line:10%
rests in its ability for you
to get context of your life,

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.385 align:middle line:10%
so that you see how
things fit together.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.619 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So there
you get your insights.

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:20.886 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.288 align:middle line:10%
The insights are important.

00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:24.957 align:middle line:10%
But after insight, that's
where talk therapy generally

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:26.892 align:middle line:10%
stops in its effectiveness.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:28.961 align:middle line:10%
The expectation is, and
this is what I was taught

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:31.897 align:middle line:10%
in the university training,
is, once you have the "a-ha,"

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.999 align:middle line:10%
the insight, then
things just change.

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:36.502 align:middle line:10%
Well, ah, that
wasn't my experience.

00:20:36.502 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:10%
Hardly at all did
that ever happen.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.272 align:middle line:84%
So you start with
insight, that's great.

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:41.574 align:middle line:84%
People then understand
the nature of their lives.

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:42.842 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
almost your base camp.

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:43.609 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: It is.

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.678 align:middle line:10%
You can start with that.

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:47.546 align:middle line:10%
Good, insight-based
talk therapists

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:50.549 align:middle line:10%
can help you very quickly
connect the dots in your life.

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:52.585 align:middle line:10%
You see how this
affects this, and this

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:10%
is how these things go together.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.187 align:middle line:10%
And the impact of them.

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:58.257 align:middle line:10%
But then, the next step
is the critical step.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:01.427 align:middle line:10%
You have to move from OK, that's
what was, and that's why it is,

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:03.195 align:middle line:10%
to how do you want it to be?

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:04.396 align:middle line:10%
Then you're creating a new--

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:06.632 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But isn't there
often an addiction in there?

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:11.103 align:middle line:10%
A little addiction to
some of the, maybe,

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.106 align:middle line:10%
misunderstood consequences,
or benefits from--

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.342 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Oh, sure,
sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:16.342 --> 00:21:17.143 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:19.311 align:middle line:10%
If you rewrite the software
of the subconscious,

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:22.348 align:middle line:10%
you've got a way better chance
of making long-lasting changes

00:21:22.348 --> 00:21:23.549 align:middle line:10%
than just having the insight.

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:24.717 align:middle line:90%
But you're absolutely right.

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:27.319 align:middle line:84%
In psychology, it's
called "secondary gain."

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.654 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Secondary gain, right.

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:30.289 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: There's
a benefit, a payoff

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.824 align:middle line:10%
you've had all those
years from what

00:21:31.824 --> 00:21:33.926 align:middle line:10%
you consider to be a disability.

00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:35.227 align:middle line:10%
Which, on one hand, it is.

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:38.264 align:middle line:10%
But on the other hand, it's
an ability, to get a need met.

00:21:38.264 --> 00:21:39.965 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, what
happens is, when

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.535 align:middle line:10%
a person changes their
perception at the subconscious

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:44.803 align:middle line:10%
level and begins
behaving differently,

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:48.541 align:middle line:10%
that critical need-- which might
be getting attention, love,

00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:52.144 align:middle line:10%
feeling important, feeling
valuable, being a victim

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:54.246 align:middle line:10%
so somebody will save you--
those kinds of things?

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's all being met.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.414 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.382 align:middle line:10%
Huge payoff.

00:21:56.382 --> 00:21:59.952 align:middle line:10%
So if you don't have that need
met with the new way of being,

00:21:59.952 --> 00:22:02.621 align:middle line:10%
sometimes people will revert
back to the old way of being.

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.089 align:middle line:10%
The good news about
that in PSYCH-K

00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:07.126 align:middle line:10%
is this-- as soon as you
recognize that's the case,

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:08.894 align:middle line:10%
then you can build
in that need getting

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:10.596 align:middle line:10%
met with the new
vision of the future.

00:22:10.596 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:10%
Good.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.764 align:middle line:10%
That's good to know.

00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:13.832 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: So you're not
just stuck, in that way.

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:16.535 align:middle line:10%
Because negotiating basic
needs out of the system

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:17.703 align:middle line:10%
doesn't work at all.

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:20.339 align:middle line:10%
You just have to figure out a
new way to get that need met.

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:21.173 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:21.874 align:middle line:90%
Very good point.

00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we're looking at the
subconscious mind, as you said,

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.678 align:middle line:90%
it's not heavily nuanced.

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
being bludgeoned.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.017 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes it's trauma
and pain that many people

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:32.918 align:middle line:90%
have learned through.

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:35.688 align:middle line:84%
And that they have
adapted their behavior to

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:90%
for survival, or whatnot.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.459 align:middle line:84%
So you have to work with
a different set of tools.

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:43.128 align:middle line:84%
You can know that someone
said something really, just,

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:45.297 align:middle line:84%
horrific to you that
destroyed your self-esteem

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:48.901 align:middle line:84%
when you were five
years old, for example.

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:51.103 align:middle line:84%
You can say that,
but the reality

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:53.005 align:middle line:84%
is the feelings
of it don't change

00:22:53.005 --> 00:22:54.506 align:middle line:90%
by even recognizing that.

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:55.007 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:55.641 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Absolutely.

00:22:55.641 --> 00:22:57.509 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that
feeling, that's the buzz.

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:58.711 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:22:58.711 --> 00:22:59.345 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:59.345 --> 00:23:01.614 align:middle line:10%
The feeling is the
program expressing itself.

00:23:01.614 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: Feelings are the
direct response of perception.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.986 align:middle line:10%
If you perceive that, whatever
happened to you in the past,

00:23:06.986 --> 00:23:10.256 align:middle line:10%
it can be really traumatic
and all that from one person's

00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:12.691 align:middle line:10%
point of view, but no big deal
from another person's point

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:13.192 align:middle line:10%
of view.

00:23:13.192 --> 00:23:14.994 align:middle line:10%
It's real interesting
how the human mind

00:23:14.994 --> 00:23:19.531 align:middle line:10%
in each individual processes
experience quite differently.

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.567 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Give me an idea
of a couple of the-- we

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:22.635 align:middle line:10%
have a couple
minutes before we're

00:23:22.635 --> 00:23:23.636 align:middle line:10%
going to take a little break.

00:23:23.636 --> 00:23:26.038 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know what happened
in one of your first really

00:23:26.038 --> 00:23:27.973 align:middle line:84%
big breakthroughs, when
you put this together.

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.174 align:middle line:90%
Give us an example.

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:30.876 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: The biggest
one, the one that

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:33.445 align:middle line:10%
happened first, that really put
it on the map for me to say,

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:35.414 align:middle line:10%
there's something here
that's very important,

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:38.083 align:middle line:10%
was that a woman was referred
to me, who had just gotten out

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.052 align:middle line:10%
of drug and alcohol
rehab, and she'd

00:23:40.052 --> 00:23:41.654 align:middle line:10%
been diagnosed with
Crohn's disease.

00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:43.155 align:middle line:10%
That's a
gastrointestinal disorder

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle line:10%
that typically is incurable from
the mainstream medical model's

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.193 align:middle line:10%
point of view.

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:49.795 align:middle line:10%
And I worked with her.

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:51.196 align:middle line:10%
That very first
pattern I told you

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:52.798 align:middle line:10%
about that was given
to me in my head,

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.199 align:middle line:10%
called the core belief balance?

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:56.802 align:middle line:10%
She was the first person
I ever did that with.

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:10%
And so, we ran that pattern.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.206 align:middle line:10%
It took about 45 minutes to
do, because I was new at it,

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:03.142 align:middle line:10%
and because it's a little
bit more complicated

00:24:03.142 --> 00:24:05.577 align:middle line:10%
with these 13 paired
statements, and so on.

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:08.881 align:middle line:10%
But we went through the
whole pattern of change.

00:24:08.881 --> 00:24:11.884 align:middle line:10%
This is something you do lying
down, rather than standing up,

00:24:11.884 --> 00:24:14.753 align:middle line:10%
so she was on a body table,
like a massage table.

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:17.189 align:middle line:10%
So she gets off the table
after the thing is over,

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.624 align:middle line:10%
and she looks at
me, and she says,

00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what just happened,
but something just changed.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.695 align:middle line:10%
And I said, great.

00:24:22.695 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what
happened, either.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.364 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let's find out.

00:24:25.364 --> 00:24:27.366 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: And tell me
what the change is like.

00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:29.601 align:middle line:10%
So, to make a long
story short, I

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:32.604 align:middle line:10%
saw her, couple, two or three
more times in an hour session,

00:24:32.604 --> 00:24:33.472 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:36.375 align:middle line:10%
She went back to
the clinic-- this

00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:39.478 align:middle line:10%
was in Nevada, the GI clinic,
gastrointestinal clinic--

00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:43.816 align:middle line:10%
and had new pictures, new
X-rays taken, of her colon.

00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:45.317 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
sign of Crohn's.

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long
after this was--

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:48.654 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: This was
maybe two, three months.

00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:49.555 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't long it all.

00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:51.323 align:middle line:10%
And so, of course,
when the clinic

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:53.559 align:middle line:10%
looked at her pictures, and
the first thing they said,

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:54.927 align:middle line:10%
well, we must have
the wrong X-rays,

00:24:54.927 --> 00:24:56.362 align:middle line:10%
because there's no Crohn's here.

00:24:56.362 --> 00:25:00.065 align:middle line:10%
There's no blockage in
the intestinal tract.

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:02.935 align:middle line:10%
And then they said, well,
no, they're the right X-rays.

00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:05.738 align:middle line:10%
She said, well that can't
be, because it's incurable.

00:25:05.738 --> 00:25:09.074 align:middle line:10%
So it must be some kind
of spontaneous remission.

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:12.945 align:middle line:10%
They make up words for
incurable diseases being cured,

00:25:12.945 --> 00:25:14.947 align:middle line:10%
because in their world,
that's impossible.

00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:15.614 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:17.282 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: And yet,
that was the case.

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:21.153 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But you have seen this
over and over and over again.

00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:25.724 align:middle line:84%
The body has an innate ability
to take care of itself,

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:27.459 align:middle line:90%
if we get out of its way.

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.429 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: I would say it
a little bit differently,

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:32.398 align:middle line:84%
but real close to
what you just said.

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:10%
The body has an innate
ability to take instructions

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.901 align:middle line:10%
from the subconscious mind.

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:39.204 align:middle line:10%
And when the signals from
the subconscious to the body

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:42.241 align:middle line:10%
change, the body
changes its response.

00:25:42.241 --> 00:25:44.109 align:middle line:10%
What we see is
the body changing,

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:47.179 align:middle line:10%
so, it's kind of like
watching somebody drive a car,

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:49.415 align:middle line:10%
but you're not from a planet
where there are any cars.

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:51.116 align:middle line:84%
And the windows are
real dark, and there's

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:52.885 align:middle line:84%
somebody in there driving
it, but you don't know that.

00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:84%
You see the car doing all
kinds of intelligent things,

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.688 align:middle line:84%
so you think the
car is intelligent.

00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:58.357 align:middle line:84%
When, in fact, the
driver's intelligent.

00:25:58.357 --> 00:26:00.392 align:middle line:10%
If they stop the car
and the driver gets out,

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.094 align:middle line:10%
the car is really stupid.

00:26:02.094 --> 00:26:04.863 align:middle line:10%
Then it just sits there and
doesn't know what to do.

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:07.533 align:middle line:10%
So the idea here, and
we've done this a lot

00:26:07.533 --> 00:26:11.069 align:middle line:10%
in complementary healing,
and integrative medicine,

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.938 align:middle line:10%
is to talk about the
wisdom of the body.

00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:10%
But if Bruce Lipton were
here in this interview,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.376 align:middle line:10%
he would say, well,
that's not exactly true.

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:20.779 align:middle line:10%
That what's true about the body
is it has this innate capacity

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:24.049 align:middle line:10%
to respond to what he would
call epigenetic signals.

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:25.217 align:middle line:10%
Signals above the genes.

00:26:25.217 --> 00:26:26.385 align:middle line:10%
Which is the mind.

00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:28.854 align:middle line:10%
The mind informs the
body, the cells then

00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:31.723 align:middle line:10%
produce the chemistry, and then
you see the effect in the body.

00:26:31.723 --> 00:26:33.225 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So what's
the chain, then,

00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:36.028 align:middle line:10%
when you have the conscious
mind, the subconscious mind?

00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:38.797 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to make a conscious
decision to even take on change

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:40.933 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, before you
inspire the subconscious

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:41.433 align:middle line:90%
change?

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.402 align:middle line:90%
So does it start with a choice?

00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:44.069 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A conscious choice.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.473 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then it goes to
working with the subconscious,

00:26:47.473 --> 00:26:48.941 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes
into the physical?

00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAMS: The conscious
mind's job is to look at life,

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.679 align:middle line:10%
look at what's going on
in your life, and say,

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:54.446 align:middle line:10%
is this working for me?

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:55.681 align:middle line:10%
Is this not working for me?

00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:58.884 align:middle line:10%
It's the initial one that
decides on what your goal is.

00:26:58.884 --> 00:27:01.086 align:middle line:10%
But right after that part?

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:03.489 align:middle line:10%
It better be partnered
up with the subconscious.

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:04.056 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:04.056 --> 00:27:05.791 align:middle line:84%
On that note, we're going
to take a short break,

00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:07.192 align:middle line:84%
and when we come
back, we're going

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:09.428 align:middle line:84%
to look at some of the
other examples of people

00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
that Rob has worked with,
which are really just stunning.

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.199 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:15.801 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We are
back, and we're going

00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:18.937 align:middle line:10%
to talk about a very, very
personal experience for Rob,

00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:21.874 align:middle line:10%
because it had to do with his
mother, who had breast cancer.

00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:26.111 align:middle line:10%
But I would like you to give
a little bit of backstory

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:26.712 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:29.081 align:middle line:84%
So we can see it come full
circle by the end of this.

00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:29.781 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Sure.

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:31.683 align:middle line:84%
Well, because of
this interview, I

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:33.952 align:middle line:84%
started thinking a lot about
the backstory, as you say,

00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:35.787 align:middle line:90%
and how all this began.

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:40.692 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, when I was in my
20s, or maybe 22, 23 years old,

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:43.996 align:middle line:84%
something like that, I
was living in California.

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:45.564 align:middle line:90%
My mother was there, of course.

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:47.699 align:middle line:84%
And she was really
this, sort of,

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:50.269 align:middle line:84%
spiritual mentor to
me in my early 20s.

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:54.106 align:middle line:84%
I was at UCLA,
studying philosophy,

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:57.209 align:middle line:84%
and a form of philosophy
that's really sort of-- it's

00:27:57.209 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:90%
called logical positivism.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.946 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
materially-based.

00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:03.415 align:middle line:84%
And its version of
spirituality isn't anything

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:05.784 align:middle line:84%
like we talk about
spirituality these days.

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:10.422 align:middle line:84%
And she kept nudging me to take
a broader perspective of what

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:13.125 align:middle line:84%
philosophy really was,
and what spirituality was,

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:15.761 align:middle line:84%
and at one point, she
just kept hounding

00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:18.363 align:middle line:84%
me to go see this woman
she thought the world of,

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:21.767 align:middle line:84%
that did past life regressions
and psychic readings.

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:24.336 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's
just ridiculous.

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:25.938 align:middle line:90%
That's all just crap, Mom.

00:28:25.938 --> 00:28:29.274 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go
listen to some woman

00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:32.144 align:middle line:84%
go on about stuff that
can't possibly be true.

00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:33.712 align:middle line:90%
She's making it up, anyway.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:37.282 align:middle line:90%
Well, my mother was persistent.

00:28:37.282 --> 00:28:41.653 align:middle line:84%
Now look, son, won't you do
this just for your mother?

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:42.154 align:middle line:90%
Guilt trips.

00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:43.088 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Guilt trips.

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.256 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Exactly.

00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:48.694 align:middle line:84%
So I went and sat with this
woman for a couple of hours,

00:28:48.694 --> 00:28:51.096 align:middle line:84%
and she did this, what she
called a "soul reading."

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:52.464 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the beginning

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:55.567 align:middle line:84%
of me being very
inquisitive about things

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.969 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand.

00:28:56.969 --> 00:29:00.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did it resonate
with you at that time?

00:29:00.005 --> 00:29:02.908 align:middle line:84%
Once you sat in the
chair across from her?

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.543 align:middle line:90%
Or were you resistant to it?

00:29:04.543 --> 00:29:05.911 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:08.113 align:middle line:84%
It resonated, and
I was resistant.

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:10.182 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to believe
what she was telling me.

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:11.316 align:middle line:90%
Some of it I couldn't confirm.

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:12.884 align:middle line:84%
There were past lives I
don't know anything about.

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:14.386 align:middle line:90%
You're this, and you did this.

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:17.155 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
about it, Regina, was

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:20.092 align:middle line:84%
that the qualities and
attributes that this woman

00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:22.527 align:middle line:84%
spoke of, that I had now--
and this is at the tender

00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:84%
age of 20-something-- I had
the whole rest of my life ahead

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.798 align:middle line:84%
of me-- she said, you could
be good at this, and this,

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:27.432 align:middle line:90%
and this.

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.434 align:middle line:84%
I knew that, but she had
no right to know that,

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.136 align:middle line:90%
as far as I was concerned.

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:34.706 align:middle line:84%
So I did my best to
just dismiss her.

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:35.607 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't.

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:37.242 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, then
she got me curious.

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:39.578 align:middle line:84%
So I went to see two more
psychics after that, because I

00:29:39.578 --> 00:29:40.946 align:middle line:84%
figured, my logical
mind told me,

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:43.515 align:middle line:84%
if you go see another psychic--
I mean, they're all the same,

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:44.716 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:46.418 align:middle line:84%
You would see another
one, and he or she

00:29:46.418 --> 00:29:48.887 align:middle line:84%
would tell you something
different, well, then--

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:49.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The first
one was wrong.

00:29:49.655 --> 00:29:49.821 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:51.256 align:middle line:84%
The first one was wrong, or
the second one's faking it--

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:53.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're on your
path, trying to disprove them.

00:29:53.025 --> 00:29:53.859 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Exactly.

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:56.361 align:middle line:84%
I was on the "this
can't be true" path.

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:58.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, obviously you
got on this "can be true" path,

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:01.099 align:middle line:90%
because we're here, so-- OK.

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:02.467 align:middle line:90%
So that's the lineage--

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.969 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: That
was her gift to me.

00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:05.671 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was a
gift from your mother.

00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:06.104 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:07.739 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
let's talk about what

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:10.075 align:middle line:84%
happened when your mom found
out she had breast cancer.

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:10.776 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Sure.

00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:14.346 align:middle line:84%
At the time, she was living
in San Diego, California,

00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:17.282 align:middle line:84%
and I was living
here in Colorado.

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:20.018 align:middle line:84%
And she was planning on
moving out of the city.

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:90%
The city had outgrown her.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.256 align:middle line:84%
She just couldn't get around, it
was not good for her to drive,

00:30:24.256 --> 00:30:26.324 align:middle line:90%
she was 81 years old.

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:28.126 align:middle line:84%
So she's looking for
a quieter place, where

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:30.529 align:middle line:84%
she can have a quieter life,
and a small group of friends,

00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:31.863 align:middle line:90%
and it's not so tense.

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:33.532 align:middle line:84%
So she chose the
small town where

00:30:33.532 --> 00:30:35.634 align:middle line:84%
I live, in South
Central Colorado.

00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:38.103 align:middle line:84%
So she had all the plans set
up, she was ready to move,

00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:39.237 align:middle line:90%
and she did one last thing.

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
She thought, well, I better go
get a real good medical check

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.142 align:middle line:84%
up before I move
out to the boonies.

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And so she did.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.714 align:middle line:84%
She saw an oncologist,
and some other physicians

00:30:48.714 --> 00:30:51.183 align:middle line:84%
at Scripps Institute, one of
the finest medical facilities

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:52.451 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:54.319 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
they did a mammogram,

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:57.923 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out they found
cancer in one of her breasts.

00:30:57.923 --> 00:31:02.294 align:middle line:84%
And the oncologist said,
essentially, this is not good,

00:31:02.294 --> 00:31:07.699 align:middle line:84%
and you need to have a radical
mastectomy immediately.

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:10.035 align:middle line:84%
She was stunned, of
course, for this diagnosis,

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:12.571 align:middle line:84%
and the prognosis,
which was pretty grim.

00:31:12.571 --> 00:31:14.506 align:middle line:90%
So she went home.

00:31:14.506 --> 00:31:15.941 align:middle line:84%
She said, I need
to sleep on this.

00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:19.411 align:middle line:84%
She went home that night,
and she had a dream.

00:31:19.411 --> 00:31:23.315 align:middle line:84%
And that dream was that she
did consent to the operation,

00:31:23.315 --> 00:31:25.083 align:middle line:84%
but she died on the
operating table.

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ooh.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.385 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: And this
was very real to her.

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:27.753 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ooh.

00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:28.353 align:middle line:90%
I have chills.

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:29.054 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:30.489 align:middle line:90%
Me, too, when she told me.

00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:33.492 align:middle line:84%
So she wakes up the next
day with this vivid dream

00:31:33.492 --> 00:31:35.894 align:middle line:84%
in her mind, and said, I
can't go down that road.

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:38.096 align:middle line:84%
So she asked some more
questions about the cancer.

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:40.265 align:middle line:84%
It was a slow-growing
kind of cancer,

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless
life-threatening.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.035 align:middle line:84%
And she made a
call at that point.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.738 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go
through with this surgery.

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:49.474 align:middle line:84%
She believes in
these kinds of signs.

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:50.075 align:middle line:90%
Very clearly.

00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:50.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:50.909 align:middle line:90%
As she should.

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.177 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:53.845 align:middle line:90%
So, she moved.

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.947 align:middle line:84%
And we had a
discussion about it.

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:57.682 align:middle line:84%
All things considered,
we said, all right,

00:31:57.682 --> 00:32:00.152 align:middle line:84%
what if we set ourselves a
goal of, six months from now,

00:32:00.152 --> 00:32:03.855 align:middle line:84%
we'll go back to a hospital--
not back to California,

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:06.358 align:middle line:84%
but one in Colorado--
have new pictures taken,

00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and compare the two,
and see what happens.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:12.597 align:middle line:84%
If we can't redirect this
disease process using PSYCH-K,

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:15.534 align:middle line:84%
much less invasive-- you get
to keep both breasts, for one

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:19.671 align:middle line:84%
thing-- then, if it
turns out we could not

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:21.373 align:middle line:84%
affect it in one
way or the other,

00:32:21.373 --> 00:32:24.009 align:middle line:84%
then we would take a look
at a more radical procedure.

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:90%
But what if we gave it a chance?

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.078 align:middle line:90%
And she said, let's do that.

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:27.712 align:middle line:90%
So she came.

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:29.648 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to
her very recently,

00:32:29.648 --> 00:32:31.283 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
remember exactly how

00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:33.618 align:middle line:84%
many PSYCH-K sessions
we did, but we both

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:35.787 align:middle line:84%
agreed it was
between four and six.

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Not very many, over the
course of six months.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:43.862 align:middle line:84%
But they were very-- what can I
say?-- very meaningful to her,

00:32:43.862 --> 00:32:47.399 align:middle line:84%
because the subconscious mind
was really helping her make

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:50.101 align:middle line:84%
some changes that she hadn't
been able to change for all

00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:90%
of her life.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.572 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
family interactions

00:32:53.572 --> 00:32:57.075 align:middle line:84%
that took place, that probably
were the trigger for the cancer

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:57.576 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:32:57.576 --> 00:33:00.645 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that one of
the most salient features,

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.747 align:middle line:84%
personality features,
of cancer patients,

00:33:02.747 --> 00:33:06.151 align:middle line:84%
is long-held anger and
resentment, unexpressed.

00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:08.220 align:middle line:84%
This is in that
psychoneuroimmunological

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.521 align:middle line:90%
literature you talked about.

00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:12.557 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to her
about that, because I

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:13.592 align:middle line:90%
was a part of the family.

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:14.659 align:middle line:90%
There were four children in it.

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:17.195 align:middle line:84%
My father and mother divorced
when I was about 15 years old.

00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:19.631 align:middle line:90%
They'd been married 16 years.

00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:22.801 align:middle line:84%
And as I queried
her about it, she

00:33:22.801 --> 00:33:25.403 align:middle line:84%
admitted that she hadn't
really let go of that anger.

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:28.139 align:middle line:84%
She was very hurt, very
disappointed, very surprised,

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.274 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:33:29.274 --> 00:33:31.243 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about
that for a little bit.

00:33:31.243 --> 00:33:32.477 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we worked on.

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:34.946 align:middle line:84%
That sort of stuff was
the stuff that we got to

00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:38.116 align:middle line:84%
in these four to six sessions
over the six month period.

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:40.252 align:middle line:84%
Now the interesting part
was, we went back, we

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:42.921 align:middle line:84%
went to the hospital,
got new pictures taken,

00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:45.757 align:middle line:84%
and I was allowed to come into
the room with the radiologist,

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:46.658 align:middle line:90%
and so was my mother.

00:33:46.658 --> 00:33:48.693 align:middle line:84%
And we were in this dark
room, and these pictures

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:51.129 align:middle line:90%
of the X-rays were on the wall.

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:54.032 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a physician, so
I'm looking at the pictures,

00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:56.368 align:middle line:84%
and I see the current
picture, and it's

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:58.837 align:middle line:84%
got this white, scarring
material in one of the breasts.

00:33:58.837 --> 00:34:00.939 align:middle line:90%
And I said, gee, that's too bad.

00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:03.208 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the
cancer's still there.

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:06.678 align:middle line:84%
And the radiologist said,
no, that isn't cancer.

00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:11.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's tissue
damage from the biopsy

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:12.817 align:middle line:90%
at Scripps Institute--

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:13.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The cancer was gone.

00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:14.351 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: -- six months ago.

00:34:14.351 --> 00:34:14.853 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:16.521 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't completely gone.

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:17.589 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what it was.

00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.956 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:34:17.956 --> 00:34:18.657 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: So he
says, no, no, no, there

00:34:18.657 --> 00:34:20.158 align:middle line:90%
are these little dots, here.

00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.458 align:middle line:90%
This is the cancer.

00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:22.594 align:middle line:90%
And we compared the two.

00:34:22.594 --> 00:34:25.163 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's
clearly been at least a 40%

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:28.033 align:middle line:84%
to 50% reduction in
these little dots.

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:28.667 align:middle line:90%
In the cancer.

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:30.534 align:middle line:84%
So it's going in
the right direction.

00:34:30.534 --> 00:34:33.371 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at her, looked
at my mother, and said,

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:36.141 align:middle line:90%
are you afraid of the C word?

00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:37.242 align:middle line:90%
Meaning cancer, of course.

00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no, I'm not.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.578 align:middle line:84%
And he said, then
I see no reason

00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:43.514 align:middle line:84%
for any radical action
at this time at all.

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you want to, you
can come back in six months,

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.819 align:middle line:90%
we'll take some more pictures.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:48.987 align:middle line:90%
That was 11 years ago.

00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
My mother is 92 years
old, still in health,

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.625 align:middle line:84%
still alive, still
with both breasts.

00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:55.994 align:middle line:84%
So that drives the
point home, to me,

00:34:55.994 --> 00:34:57.796 align:middle line:90%
in a very, very personal way.

00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:02.434 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so gratified
that she had pushed me

00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:04.602 align:middle line:84%
hard enough to get
me on this path.

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.538 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This path
where you can save her.

00:35:06.538 --> 00:35:06.838 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Right.

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:07.038 align:middle line:90%
Where I become--

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:08.406 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're going
to help her save herself.

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:09.574 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:10.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:11.776 align:middle line:84%
Now, I assume there
are other people,

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.678 align:middle line:84%
many, many other people,
who have had cancers

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds, who have
been helped by this?

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.181 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:18.383 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the guy that's
seen all of them, fortunately--

00:35:18.383 --> 00:35:19.751 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you have
thousands of facilitators.

00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:20.819 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:24.189 align:middle line:84%
And I get to hear the stories
vicariously these days, mostly.

00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:25.690 align:middle line:90%
But they're beautiful stories.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:30.362 align:middle line:84%
There was one I just heard
about a woman that had diabetes.

00:35:30.362 --> 00:35:31.963 align:middle line:84%
She'd had it for
18 years, and it

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:34.132 align:middle line:84%
had gotten to the point
where she was giving herself

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:37.369 align:middle line:84%
insulin shots four times
a day, for eight years.

00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:40.739 align:middle line:84%
And one of our
instructors, Larry Valmore,

00:35:40.739 --> 00:35:43.408 align:middle line:84%
who's in the Denver area,
worked with this woman

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:46.845 align:middle line:84%
for about an hour and
1/2, at one point,

00:35:46.845 --> 00:35:50.048 align:middle line:84%
and then, time
for her next shot.

00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:51.816 align:middle line:84%
Well, she checks
her insulin levels

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.084 align:middle line:90%
before she takes the shot.

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:55.653 align:middle line:84%
That determines the
potency of the shot.

00:35:55.653 --> 00:36:00.258 align:middle line:84%
And the insulin level had
dropped to virtually normal,

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:01.960 align:middle line:84%
in just a very short
period of time.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.696 align:middle line:84%
She woke up in the morning,
and normally her insulin levels

00:36:04.696 --> 00:36:07.332 align:middle line:84%
would be even worse,
but they weren't.

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:90%
They were yet even lower.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.235 align:middle line:90%
More at the normal level.

00:36:10.235 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:90%
This happened very quickly.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.038 align:middle line:90%
Literally overnight.

00:36:13.038 --> 00:36:15.306 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she essentially
reverse the diabetes?

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:16.007 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:17.942 align:middle line:84%
What happened was, she's
off the oral medicine

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:19.744 align:middle line:84%
she's been taking, she
takes no more shots.

00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:22.514 align:middle line:84%
This was, I don't know,
five or more years later.

00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:25.183 align:middle line:84%
The important thing
here is, I think,

00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:29.487 align:middle line:84%
is to understand that, when
you think of the mind as part

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:32.557 align:middle line:84%
of your medical team-- the
mind of the patient, not just

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:35.527 align:middle line:84%
the mind of the doctor--
the mind of the patient

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:38.029 align:middle line:84%
is an active ingredient
in the healing process.

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:40.498 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most powerful,
and most underrated,

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:41.966 align:middle line:90%
in our medical system.

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I really believe, Regina,
that if our medical community

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.338 align:middle line:84%
could see the mind
of the patient

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:50.542 align:middle line:84%
as another doctor on
the team for healing,

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:54.245 align:middle line:84%
that our entire health care
program would be so much more

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:54.746 align:middle line:90%
effective.

00:36:54.746 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.481 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:56.481 --> 00:36:58.349 align:middle line:84%
But we, I think we're
still a little-- that's

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:00.585 align:middle line:90%
not under Obamacare just yet.

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:02.153 align:middle line:84%
We're a little way,
a little way away.

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:03.588 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean people can't

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.290 align:middle line:84%
take personal
responsibility and do this.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:08.126 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this is something
that's going to break the bank.

00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:10.528 align:middle line:84%
Anybody, pretty much, can
afford PSYCH-K sessions,

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:11.763 align:middle line:90%
if they were going to go that.

00:37:11.763 --> 00:37:14.666 align:middle line:84%
So you've made it something--
it's a modality that's

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:18.103 align:middle line:84%
very accessible to
the average person,

00:37:18.103 --> 00:37:20.738 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get into
some other areas of this,

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:23.775 align:middle line:84%
because we've only talked about
physical health challenges.

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:27.779 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this extends
to emotional, mental,

00:37:27.779 --> 00:37:29.447 align:middle line:84%
but it even extends
to spiritual.

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:30.815 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
I wanted to get

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:33.785 align:middle line:84%
into that incredible
experiment you did.

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:35.453 align:middle line:90%
But first, let's set it up.

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:38.022 align:middle line:84%
Who is Doctor Jeffrey
Fannin, and how did you meet?

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:40.525 align:middle line:84%
And what was the genesis
for this experiment

00:37:40.525 --> 00:37:42.360 align:middle line:90%
you're going to tell us about?

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.496 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: Well, it was
a wonderful and fortuitous

00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:46.731 align:middle line:84%
meeting, almost
two years ago now.

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:53.338 align:middle line:84%
And Jeff is a wonderful man,
and a fabulous neuroscientist.

00:37:53.338 --> 00:37:57.609 align:middle line:84%
And he and I met sort
of in an odd way,

00:37:57.609 --> 00:38:00.311 align:middle line:84%
through a middle person
who actually knew Jeff.

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:05.016 align:middle line:84%
And Jeff was helping this
person set up her own setup

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:06.751 align:middle line:90%
for doing neuroscience.

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:09.454 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, brain
mapping and such.

00:38:09.454 --> 00:38:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was this
woman that introduced

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.892 align:middle line:84%
Jeff to PSYCH-K for the
first time said, "Do you

00:38:13.892 --> 00:38:14.659 align:middle line:90%
know about this?"

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:16.361 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "I've
never heard of it."

00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:18.396 align:middle line:84%
"Well, would you like to
know something about it?

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:20.498 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it ties
into what we're doing."

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:21.866 align:middle line:90%
And so Jeff said, well, sure.

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:24.836 align:middle line:84%
And so she facilitated
a change process

00:38:24.836 --> 00:38:26.871 align:middle line:84%
called the "optimal
health balance."

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:29.274 align:middle line:84%
This balance is kind of like
that core belief balance

00:38:29.274 --> 00:38:31.843 align:middle line:84%
I told you about, except
there's 22 statements involved,

00:38:31.843 --> 00:38:36.114 align:middle line:84%
and they're all derived from the
field of psychoneuroimmunology.

00:38:36.114 --> 00:38:38.583 align:middle line:84%
They're all the
characteristics and qualities

00:38:38.583 --> 00:38:40.151 align:middle line:90%
of people who stay well.

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.152 align:middle line:90%
Not people who get sick.

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not studying
pathology here.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.188 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about just like--

00:38:43.188 --> 00:38:43.655 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:45.823 align:middle line:84%
How much money is there
normally dedicated

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:47.759 align:middle line:90%
to that in the universities?

00:38:47.759 --> 00:38:48.493 align:middle line:90%
Virtually nothing.

00:38:48.493 --> 00:38:49.194 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:38:49.194 --> 00:38:49.961 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:51.796 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's
not a drug for it.

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.232 align:middle line:90%
You can't bottle it and sell it.

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:57.702 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of it is that
once you introduce these belief

00:38:57.702 --> 00:39:01.372 align:middle line:84%
systems to a person, it's
like cloning healthy beliefs.

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:03.708 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having your body
filled with information

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:06.277 align:middle line:84%
from toxic beliefs, you
turn that around completely,

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.279 align:middle line:84%
and say, all right,
what if this were true?

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.647 align:middle line:90%
What if this were your reality?

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:12.317 align:middle line:84%
That immediately begins
to change biochemistry.

00:39:12.317 --> 00:39:14.118 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing.

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:15.553 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can do this.

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:17.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know what's
interesting about that

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:21.559 align:middle line:84%
is people tend to have
a resistance to that.

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.261 align:middle line:90%
They think, oh, that's not true.

00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:25.096 align:middle line:90%
I'm just telling myself a lie.

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:27.498 align:middle line:84%
You're telling yourselves
lies all day long, anyway.

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.166 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:29.968 align:middle line:84%
You're just telling
an old story that's

00:39:29.968 --> 00:39:33.171 align:middle line:84%
worn out and no longer true by
reinforcing these subconscious

00:39:33.171 --> 00:39:33.671 align:middle line:90%
beliefs.

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:34.872 align:middle line:90%
That's a lie.

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.407 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to
be something in us

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:41.446 align:middle line:84%
where we want to be so
diligent to the conscious mind

00:39:41.446 --> 00:39:44.315 align:middle line:84%
that we won't allow ourselves
to insert a new story.

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.283 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:39:45.283 --> 00:39:46.117 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's up with that?

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:48.086 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: And remember
that the new story told

00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:50.255 align:middle line:84%
at the conscious level
has very little effect

00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:51.189 align:middle line:90%
on the subconscious.

00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:53.358 align:middle line:84%
And very little effect
on your biochemistry.

00:39:53.358 --> 00:39:56.961 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason that there
is PSYCH-K. Its core value is

00:39:56.961 --> 00:40:00.031 align:middle line:84%
it delivers conscious wisdom
to the subconscious mind, where

00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:02.567 align:middle line:84%
it can turn into
constructive biochemistry.

00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:06.004 align:middle line:84%
So using the same idea,
taking these belief systems

00:40:06.004 --> 00:40:08.339 align:middle line:84%
and then introducing them to
the subconscious mind using

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.942 align:middle line:84%
one of the patterns
for doing that,

00:40:10.942 --> 00:40:13.711 align:middle line:84%
is a whole big different deal
than saying affirmations--

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:16.381 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm really well, I trust
my body to heal itself,

00:40:16.381 --> 00:40:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm powerful-- and that's
interesting, but not

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:21.753 align:middle line:84%
necessarily to the subconscious,
unless you speak its language.

00:40:21.753 --> 00:40:23.988 align:middle line:84%
Once you do-- and that's
what happened with Jeff.

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:27.892 align:middle line:84%
He had this experience, and
he was so profoundly moved

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:31.462 align:middle line:84%
once the process was finished,
he said, I just feel different.

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:34.832 align:middle line:84%
I feel different than I felt
before I started this process.

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:36.067 align:middle line:90%
In a good way.

00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he was very interested
in what had transpired.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.839 align:middle line:84%
He actually brain mapped
himself before the process,

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:43.141 align:middle line:90%
and then after.

00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:45.443 align:middle line:84%
And his story's very interesting
about what he noticed.

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:49.080 align:middle line:84%
This very big shift in the
consciousness of his own brain,

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.015 align:middle line:90%
in the brain energy patterns.

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:52.817 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to
be interviewing him,

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:53.785 align:middle line:90%
so I will ask him about that.

00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:54.719 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Wonderful.

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:55.586 align:middle line:90%
Please do.

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:57.388 align:middle line:84%
Because that got his
undivided attention.

00:40:57.388 --> 00:41:00.758 align:middle line:84%
According to Jeff,
what he saw, the change

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:02.226 align:middle line:84%
he saw in that short
period of time,

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.795 align:middle line:84%
was impossible in
his discipline.

00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:05.229 align:middle line:90%
And yet, there it was.

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So he's a very wonderful
man, with a very keen sense

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.903 align:middle line:84%
of inquiry, and
curiosity, as I am,

00:41:11.903 --> 00:41:14.072 align:middle line:90%
interested in finding out stuff.

00:41:14.072 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And so he started
along this path.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.176 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's something
here I got to find out about.

00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:20.812 align:middle line:84%
So he gave me a call,
we met on the phone,

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:23.348 align:middle line:84%
and decided that we
needed to get together.

00:41:23.348 --> 00:41:27.485 align:middle line:84%
So my wife and I drove down to
Phoenix, Arizona-- or Glendale,

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:27.985 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:30.521 align:middle line:84%
It's a suburb of Phoenix,
where Jeff's office is.

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:33.124 align:middle line:84%
And we decided we were going to
do some experiments, because he

00:41:33.124 --> 00:41:34.525 align:middle line:90%
had all the equipment.

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.661 align:middle line:84%
He could hook me up to
this brain mapping device--

00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.162 align:middle line:84%
it's an EEG machine,
essentially,

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.831 align:middle line:84%
and then in its more
sophisticated level

00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:84%
it's called quantum
electroencephalogram, QEEG.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.902 align:middle line:84%
Jeff will tell you
more about that.

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:48.539 align:middle line:84%
But we had the high
tech toys to play with.

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:50.608 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To really see
the effect on the brain--

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:50.942 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:41:50.942 --> 00:41:51.943 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -- of PSYCH-K.

00:41:51.943 --> 00:41:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:53.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:53.945 --> 00:41:56.247 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: And we stretched
it, because we didn't just

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.949 align:middle line:84%
do ordinary PSYCH-K.
We decided we

00:41:57.949 --> 00:41:59.317 align:middle line:84%
were going to do
some experiments

00:41:59.317 --> 00:42:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I had done 20 years earlier
but didn't have the equipment

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.689 align:middle line:90%
to measure the effects.

00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:07.191 align:middle line:84%
And that was about
three or four years

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.728 align:middle line:84%
into using PSYCH-K in
my private practice.

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:13.264 align:middle line:84%
I kept wondering, because
my spiritual awareness

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:16.834 align:middle line:84%
kept growing, and my curiosity
about the spirit world,

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:17.802 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:42:17.802 --> 00:42:20.071 align:middle line:84%
I just decided that
I had to find out

00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:23.508 align:middle line:84%
if we could make a link-up,
while in physical bodies,

00:42:23.508 --> 00:42:29.414 align:middle line:84%
mind to mind, with beings like
the collective consciousness

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:32.517 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, or Christ
consciousness, or Buddha

00:42:32.517 --> 00:42:36.087 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, or, in this
case, people that I admired,

00:42:36.087 --> 00:42:39.524 align:middle line:84%
like Nikola Tesla,
or Edgar Cayce,

00:42:39.524 --> 00:42:40.725 align:middle line:90%
the great American psychic.

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:42.627 align:middle line:84%
And I thought there might
be a way to do that.

00:42:42.627 --> 00:42:47.231 align:middle line:84%
So in an experimental way, using
a process in PSYCH-K called

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:51.369 align:middle line:84%
"surrogation," which allows
this higher self to higher self

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:52.437 align:middle line:90%
link-up--

00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:53.938 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why you can do that

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:57.008 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of people,
other people,

00:42:57.008 --> 00:42:59.143 align:middle line:84%
even if they're not aware
of the process, right?

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:00.178 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:43:00.178 --> 00:43:03.514 align:middle line:84%
You can use it long
distance to help people

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.783 align:middle line:84%
that you can't have be in
front of you, doing PSYCH-K.

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:07.518 align:middle line:84%
So it's very valuable
in that context.

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:10.154 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you can even do it
through another person, right?

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:11.088 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.924 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like, my
brother is having--

00:43:12.924 --> 00:43:14.292 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
brother, but say I

00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:15.927 align:middle line:84%
say my brother's
having a hard time.

00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:18.229 align:middle line:84%
You could work on my
brother through me.

00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:20.832 align:middle line:84%
That's another type
of surrogate procedure

00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:21.933 align:middle line:90%
you do as well, right?

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:22.667 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:24.635 align:middle line:84%
I work with people
in that situation,

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:26.938 align:middle line:84%
but there's a permission
protocol associated with it

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
the person's spirit.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.608 align:middle line:84%
Just because you
and I might think,

00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.144 align:middle line:84%
well, gee, your brother's in
bad shape here, let's help him--

00:43:33.144 --> 00:43:34.178 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I get this.

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:36.247 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: -- then you
have to honor what that

00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:37.482 align:middle line:90%
person's soul's journey is.

00:43:37.482 --> 00:43:38.483 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spiritual approval.

00:43:38.483 --> 00:43:38.716 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Right.

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:41.252 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which may not be a
buy-in by their conscious mind.

00:43:41.252 --> 00:43:42.587 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: No, not at all.

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:43.221 align:middle line:90%
They're two different things.

00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:44.088 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just wanted
to bring that up,

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:46.724 align:middle line:84%
because I remembered that you
do that kind of surrogate work

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:47.358 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:49.093 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into this
kind of surrogate work,

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:52.029 align:middle line:84%
where you're talking with
a disembodied individual--

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.297 align:middle line:90%
disincarnate individuals.

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.599 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:55.733 align:middle line:90%
Beings without bodies.

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:56.567 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who knows?

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:58.769 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the beings even have
an extension of themselves

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:01.339 align:middle line:84%
from that time that's still
existing in the matrix.

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Who knows how that goes?

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.508 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Exactly.

00:44:03.508 --> 00:44:06.878 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I proposed
this to Jeff, he lit up.

00:44:06.878 --> 00:44:09.247 align:middle line:84%
He thought, that's a very
interesting hypothesis.

00:44:09.247 --> 00:44:11.015 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out if
there's any way

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:14.218 align:middle line:84%
that the machinery will
indicate that there's

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:16.587 align:middle line:84%
some consciousness
other than your own mind

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.456 align:middle line:90%
in a linked-up state.

00:44:18.456 --> 00:44:22.593 align:middle line:84%
So, Raes, my wife,
facilitated the link-ups.

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:25.062 align:middle line:84%
There were eight
or nine of them.

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:27.064 align:middle line:84%
The ones that I found
most interesting

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:31.536 align:middle line:84%
were actually with Edgar
Cayce, and Nikola Tesla.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:36.407 align:middle line:84%
Several of the other ones
had interesting impacts,

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:39.510 align:middle line:84%
but they were more
physiological.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.178 align:middle line:90%
Sensations in my body.

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:44.015 align:middle line:84%
But with Cayce, it was
the most amazing thing.

00:44:44.015 --> 00:44:44.949 align:middle line:90%
That's what got me.

00:44:44.949 --> 00:44:46.384 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a powerful entity.

00:44:46.384 --> 00:44:47.385 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Oh, jeez.

00:44:47.385 --> 00:44:51.222 align:middle line:84%
And I've admired Cayce
and his work for years.

00:44:51.222 --> 00:44:54.025 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Bruce Lipton
and I gave a presentation

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:56.661 align:middle line:84%
at the Association for
Research and Enlightenment,

00:44:56.661 --> 00:44:57.828 align:middle line:90%
several years ago.

00:44:57.828 --> 00:45:01.532 align:middle line:84%
So I make the link-up, it's OK
with Cayce, it's OK with me,

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.200 align:middle line:90%
so we're linked-up now.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.936 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going through
the same procedure

00:45:04.936 --> 00:45:08.039 align:middle line:84%
I'd gone through with every
one of these other experiments.

00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:10.341 align:middle line:84%
The short period of time,
doing exactly the same kinds

00:45:10.341 --> 00:45:10.841 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:12.009 align:middle line:90%
Jeff was in charge of that part.

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:13.878 align:middle line:84%
He's the scientist, and
he's being meticulous

00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:15.146 align:middle line:90%
about how we're doing this.

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:16.547 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He has your
electrodes on the head.

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.448 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:21.986 align:middle line:84%
20 of them, in a little skull
cap that's ever so attractive.

00:45:21.986 --> 00:45:22.954 align:middle line:90%
With all the goo in it.

00:45:22.954 --> 00:45:25.356 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like being in an
old beauty parlor, only worse.

00:45:25.356 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.492 align:middle line:84%
Like one of the
old-time swimmers.

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:30.361 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, I'm
in this process,

00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:32.496 align:middle line:84%
and just going along
with it, and all

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:36.233 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden-- all of a
sudden, I get this feeling

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.802 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not in this chair.

00:45:37.802 --> 00:45:40.137 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even in the room
anymore, where I was with Jeff.

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:44.208 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I'm standing
there, in some place.

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:45.943 align:middle line:84%
Cayce is with me--
his consciousness--

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:48.646 align:middle line:84%
he's standing to my right-- I
remember this very vividly--

00:45:48.646 --> 00:45:51.015 align:middle line:84%
and he shows me this
place, and this place

00:45:51.015 --> 00:45:54.151 align:middle line:84%
is-- what it looked like to me--
the only thing I can liken it

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:57.054 align:middle line:84%
to in our world
is very, very tall

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:58.823 align:middle line:90%
walls of little LED lights.

00:45:58.823 --> 00:46:00.758 align:middle line:84%
Billions and billions
of LED lights.

00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:03.794 align:middle line:84%
And they went all the way
out into the distance,

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:06.497 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't see where
those two walls ended.

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:09.467 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, Cayce
is saying, look, this

00:46:09.467 --> 00:46:12.269 align:middle line:90%
is the Hall of Records.

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:14.171 align:middle line:84%
This is where the Akashic
Records, the records

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:17.675 align:middle line:84%
of every soul on
the planet, exist.

00:46:17.675 --> 00:46:19.010 align:middle line:90%
This is how I did what I did.

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:22.613 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Akashic
Records, I would then

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:24.849 align:middle line:84%
read the Akashic record
of that individual,

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:26.617 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I knew
how to help them.

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Either what they needed
therapeutically, medicine,

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.423 align:middle line:90%
or some other intervention.

00:46:32.423 --> 00:46:35.259 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
this, fascinated.

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:36.794 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself
in this situation.

00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:38.162 align:middle line:84%
So I'm listening
to Cayce explain

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:39.630 align:middle line:90%
how he did all this stuff.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.531 align:middle line:84%
I'm staring at
all this stuff, he

00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:42.333 align:middle line:84%
says, OK, pick any one
of the lights here,

00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:43.834 align:middle line:90%
and he said, just focus on it.

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:44.368 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:45.636 align:middle line:84%
I found one on
the wall, and just

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:46.804 align:middle line:90%
arbitrarily picked on that.

00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.305 align:middle line:84%
And it moved out
of the wall, and it

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:50.274 align:middle line:84%
came over about three
feet in front of us.

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:52.977 align:middle line:84%
And it opened up, like
it was a little vault.

00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:56.847 align:middle line:84%
And he's explaining how this
Akashic record is encased

00:46:56.847 --> 00:47:00.151 align:middle line:84%
in this area, and
every one of these LEDs

00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:01.619 align:middle line:90%
represents a different soul.

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:03.254 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was so fascinating.

00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:05.556 align:middle line:84%
So I'm listening intently to
him, and all of a sudden I

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:08.292 align:middle line:84%
hear, behind me, this
sound of this voice,

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.895 align:middle line:84%
and it says, "I need
to speak with Jeff."

00:47:10.895 --> 00:47:13.898 align:middle line:90%
And I think, what?

00:47:13.898 --> 00:47:16.367 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking I'm hallucinating--
I'm already hallucinating,

00:47:16.367 --> 00:47:19.170 align:middle line:84%
it feels like, because here I
am in this really amazing place.

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.373 align:middle line:84%
But it was so real, and
so lucid, and so detailed.

00:47:22.373 --> 00:47:24.141 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm listening
some more, and then I

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:25.476 align:middle line:90%
hear the voice again.

00:47:25.476 --> 00:47:27.311 align:middle line:90%
"I need to speak Jeff."

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I
just turned around,

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how this works,
but I knew it was Nikola Tesla.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:36.487 align:middle line:84%
It was as if I could read
his stream of energy.

00:47:36.487 --> 00:47:38.222 align:middle line:90%
His energy signature.

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:40.291 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him, and
I said, "OK, Nikola."

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:45.496 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "Tell Jeff to
meet me in alpha theta."

00:47:45.496 --> 00:47:46.397 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK--"

00:47:46.397 --> 00:47:47.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
not your language,

00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:48.733 align:middle line:90%
but that was Jeff's language.

00:47:48.733 --> 00:47:49.433 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: No, it's
Jeff's language.

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:51.368 align:middle line:84%
I said, "OK, I'll tell
him that, but could I

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:52.603 align:middle line:90%
go back now to Cayce?

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:54.605 align:middle line:84%
I'd really like to find
out more about this."

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:56.507 align:middle line:84%
But I promised Tesla
that I would tell Jeff.

00:47:58.943 --> 00:48:00.711 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
you were experiencing

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:90%
as you were going through it.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.816 align:middle line:84%
But what was Jeff seeing as
you were going through it?

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:08.886 align:middle line:84%
Because he says that
whole-brain state

00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:12.957 align:middle line:84%
is the pathway to our expanded
consciousness to The All.

00:48:12.957 --> 00:48:13.657 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:17.361 align:middle line:84%
And he'll talk more about
that, more lucidly than I can.

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:19.864 align:middle line:84%
What we've done is we've
written three technical papers

00:48:19.864 --> 00:48:21.665 align:middle line:84%
together, and they
have been published,

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:23.768 align:middle line:84%
in different fields--
one in neuroscience,

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:25.936 align:middle line:84%
one in psychotherapy, and
one in, actually, business

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:27.004 align:middle line:90%
management.

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:29.607 align:middle line:84%
And what we saw in the
research that we did,

00:48:29.607 --> 00:48:33.077 align:middle line:84%
subsequently to our meeting,
and all this fascinating stuff,

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:36.614 align:middle line:84%
was that the typical
outcome-- 98% of the time,

00:48:36.614 --> 00:48:38.816 align:middle line:84%
a person doing one of the
PSYCH-K balances, or change

00:48:38.816 --> 00:48:41.619 align:middle line:84%
processes, ends up in
this whole-brain state.

00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:43.487 align:middle line:84%
This whole-brain
state is, in effect,

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:45.856 align:middle line:84%
a balanced identification
between the left and the right

00:48:45.856 --> 00:48:49.026 align:middle line:84%
hemisphere of the brain,
where cross-talk is magnified,

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:51.529 align:middle line:84%
and you get communication
going very quickly

00:48:51.529 --> 00:48:52.463 align:middle line:90%
and uninterrupted--

00:48:52.463 --> 00:48:53.931 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
showing up in the brain map.

00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:54.832 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:56.367 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
changes-- when you were

00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:57.835 align:middle line:84%
going into this
whole-brain state,

00:48:57.835 --> 00:49:00.805 align:middle line:84%
when you were communicating with
the beings on the other side,

00:49:00.805 --> 00:49:04.175 align:middle line:84%
was distinctly different than
it had been prior, right?

00:49:04.175 --> 00:49:04.875 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:07.378 align:middle line:84%
What happened was-- let's
get this straight, too,

00:49:07.378 --> 00:49:09.413 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't
doing balances.

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:10.614 align:middle line:90%
We were doing an experiment.

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:13.584 align:middle line:84%
Where we saw the 98%
change was in people

00:49:13.584 --> 00:49:15.319 align:middle line:84%
who actually did
a PSYCH-K balance.

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:17.922 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you this story about
how we stretched the envelope

00:49:17.922 --> 00:49:19.290 align:middle line:84%
because we were
curious about it.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.825 align:middle line:84%
So when I went into
the state, and we

00:49:20.825 --> 00:49:22.593 align:middle line:84%
went in with the
permission protocols that

00:49:22.593 --> 00:49:25.129 align:middle line:84%
are spiritual in nature,
that's what made the link-up.

00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:28.732 align:middle line:84%
Then I was taken, in
this case with Cayce,

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:31.001 align:middle line:84%
to see the Hall of Records,
and the Akashic Records,

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.304 align:middle line:84%
and that's where Tesla said,
"I need to speak to Jeff."

00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:36.273 align:middle line:84%
So when this was all over,
I turned around to Jeff

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:38.008 align:middle line:84%
and I just said,
"well, that was weird."

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I said, "I just met Nikola
Tesla and Edgar Cayce,

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.149 align:middle line:90%
and Tesla has a message for you.

00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Meet him in alpha theta.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.518 align:middle line:84%
Does that make
any sense to you?"

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:49.153 align:middle line:84%
And Jeff says, "Of
course it does.

00:49:49.153 --> 00:49:51.956 align:middle line:84%
I have alpha theta machinery
all over the place here.

00:49:51.956 --> 00:49:54.458 align:middle line:84%
And I regularly go there,
so I know how to do that."

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:56.427 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting,
because we recently

00:49:56.427 --> 00:49:58.762 align:middle line:84%
interviewed Patrick Flanagan,
and that, of course,

00:49:58.762 --> 00:49:59.997 align:middle line:90%
feeds into the Tesla story.

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:02.766 align:middle line:84%
But, as Patrick Flanagan,
when he was a kid,

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:04.668 align:middle line:84%
he invented something
called the Neurophone.

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:08.172 align:middle line:84%
And what you just said
triggered my bringing this up.

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:11.442 align:middle line:84%
What he designed it
for was to create

00:50:11.442 --> 00:50:14.011 align:middle line:84%
a quicker speed, synapse speed,
between the right and left

00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:15.346 align:middle line:90%
hemispheres of the brain.

00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:17.181 align:middle line:84%
And he said, as
a result of that,

00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:20.217 align:middle line:84%
his IQ became such they actually
couldn't even measure it,

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:24.054 align:middle line:84%
and he could simultaneously
be expressing himself

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:27.858 align:middle line:84%
in beta, alpha, theta,
even down into gamma--

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:28.792 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: And delta--

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:31.262 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -- delta,
at the same time.

00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:34.899 align:middle line:84%
Which is not--
that's not possible.

00:50:34.899 --> 00:50:38.269 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're one of the,
maybe, top meditating

00:50:38.269 --> 00:50:40.004 align:middle line:84%
monks in the world,
that's not something

00:50:40.004 --> 00:50:40.971 align:middle line:90%
that's really possible.

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:43.641 align:middle line:84%
But he did it by
stimulating that exact thing

00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:45.175 align:middle line:84%
that you and Jeff
were talking about.

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:46.143 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Right.

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:48.078 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that means
there are sciences out

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:50.481 align:middle line:84%
there that just aren't
helping facilitate this

00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:51.916 align:middle line:84%
as well, which is
really exciting.

00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:54.051 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah, and this
is very portable science.

00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:56.921 align:middle line:84%
Because with the PSYCH-K, you
can do it anywhere, anytime.

00:50:56.921 --> 00:50:58.489 align:middle line:84%
And I've had kids
as young as eight

00:50:58.489 --> 00:51:00.758 align:middle line:84%
years old come to these
classes and just suck it up,

00:51:00.758 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
difficult, or complicated,

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.862 align:middle line:90%
and people 80 or 90 years old.

00:51:04.862 --> 00:51:06.897 align:middle line:90%
So, the full spectrum of people.

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.399 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how old you are,

00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:11.068 align:middle line:84%
you can benefit from
this whole-brain state.

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:13.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
deal is, once you

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:16.273 align:middle line:84%
can get the two portions of
the brain to really, clearly,

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:19.576 align:middle line:84%
start flowing back and
forth with each other,

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.412 align:middle line:84%
is that what's called
the whole-brain state?

00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:22.112 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:24.448 align:middle line:84%
If you have this balance
identification energetically

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:25.983 align:middle line:84%
between the hemispheres
of the brain,

00:51:25.983 --> 00:51:27.418 align:middle line:84%
they're operating
simultaneously,

00:51:27.418 --> 00:51:28.686 align:middle line:90%
not sequentially.

00:51:28.686 --> 00:51:30.187 align:middle line:84%
Jeff has coined the
phrase that this

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:31.889 align:middle line:84%
is a "gateway to
higher consciousness,"

00:51:31.889 --> 00:51:33.457 align:middle line:84%
and that's what he's
seeing as a neuroscientist,

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:34.191 align:middle line:90%
and where we're going.

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:36.126 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
exciting, because that's not

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:37.328 align:middle line:90%
where neuroscience has been.

00:51:37.328 --> 00:51:40.898 align:middle line:84%
They're mapping out really
basic behavioral, temperature,

00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:42.766 align:middle line:84%
left brain stuff,
a lot of the time.

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:45.302 align:middle line:84%
This is really an
exciting new territory

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:46.337 align:middle line:90%
you guys are going into.

00:51:46.337 --> 00:51:47.271 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Very much.

00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:51.008 align:middle line:84%
Jeff is one of the most
accomplished neuroscientists

00:51:51.008 --> 00:51:53.377 align:middle line:84%
in this field of human
evolution right now.

00:51:53.377 --> 00:51:55.379 align:middle line:84%
And I've been very
privileged to be

00:51:55.379 --> 00:51:56.747 align:middle line:84%
able to work with
him, and for us

00:51:56.747 --> 00:52:00.117 align:middle line:84%
to put our heads together,
and our backgrounds together,

00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:03.053 align:middle line:84%
and be able to show that
people can, in fact, change

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness
very quickly.

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.693 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's seeing that
the PSYCH-K is giving that

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:10.794 align:middle line:90%
whole-brain state--

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.061 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: That's correct.

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is allowing
that whole brain state

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.231 align:middle line:90%
to establish itself in people.

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:16.467 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: That's what our
research papers are about.

00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:18.102 align:middle line:90%
Most of them are peer reviewed.

00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:20.537 align:middle line:84%
It's showing up that this
is the way it actually

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:23.540 align:middle line:84%
works in your brain, and that
anybody can achieve this state.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.242 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you
noticed the same thing

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:27.111 align:middle line:84%
as what Patrick Flanagan
was talking about?

00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:29.380 align:middle line:84%
In that, as people go
through this process,

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.181 align:middle line:84%
they might find
even a quickening

00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:32.249 align:middle line:90%
of their mental processes?

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:33.217 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:52:33.217 --> 00:52:34.451 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit.

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:35.986 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: Well,
I can talk about it

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:40.357 align:middle line:84%
from my personal history,
more than anything else.

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.759 align:middle line:84%
My experience is,
over the years,

00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:43.560 align:middle line:84%
because I've done more
PSYCH-K than anybody

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.063 align:middle line:84%
I know, because I was
there when it originated.

00:52:46.063 --> 00:52:47.865 align:middle line:84%
And people often
ask, well, what's

00:52:47.865 --> 00:52:48.932 align:middle line:90%
PSYCH-K done for you, Rob?

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:51.535 align:middle line:84%
What's the big difference
between you and other people

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:52.336 align:middle line:90%
and PSYCH-K?

00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:54.772 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, for me
the big benefit of PSYCH-K

00:52:54.772 --> 00:52:58.709 align:middle line:84%
is my highs in life
have gotten much higher.

00:52:58.709 --> 00:53:01.812 align:middle line:84%
And my lows have
gotten much higher.

00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:03.647 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if the whole
scale of experience,

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:08.986 align:middle line:84%
of human experience, goes
up a big, giant step.

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:12.156 align:middle line:84%
And so, I used to spend a
lot more time in my lows,

00:53:12.156 --> 00:53:13.390 align:middle line:90%
and they were a lot lower.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.993 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's like a little,
acute experience of low.

00:53:15.993 --> 00:53:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I could feel that way,
but this is way better.

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:22.199 align:middle line:84%
And as people are hearing
this, they're thinking,

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:24.168 align:middle line:90%
yes, I want that.

00:53:24.168 --> 00:53:26.136 align:middle line:90%
So, let's look at it in reverse.

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:28.739 align:middle line:84%
Right now, what you're talking
about, that's your reality.

00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:30.374 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this for a long time.

00:53:30.374 --> 00:53:31.175 align:middle line:90%
And I can feel it.

00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:34.511 align:middle line:84%
You have a very nice, clean,
high frequency about you.

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.814 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people are
mired in the everydayness

00:53:36.814 --> 00:53:39.550 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of negative
feedback and programming

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.752 align:middle line:90%
coming from every direction.

00:53:41.752 --> 00:53:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
that for a moment,

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:46.490 align:middle line:84%
because we have to somehow
get out of the mire.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:48.358 align:middle line:84%
What does that look
like, when you're

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.393 align:middle line:90%
looking at brain mapping?

00:53:49.393 --> 00:53:50.961 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any idea
what Jeff is seeing,

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:52.496 align:middle line:84%
and what you were
seeing in people,

00:53:52.496 --> 00:53:55.666 align:middle line:84%
when you're just
stuck in the mud?

00:53:55.666 --> 00:53:57.734 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: The mud
is perception, Regina.

00:53:57.734 --> 00:54:00.104 align:middle line:84%
And when you change your
perception, there is no mud.

00:54:00.104 --> 00:54:00.804 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:02.706 align:middle line:84%
People are so used to
thinking about, oh, I've

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:04.708 align:middle line:84%
got this deeply
ingrained, limiting belief

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.477 align:middle line:90%
that I can't change, and so on.

00:54:06.477 --> 00:54:09.513 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly myth these
days, and not fact.

00:54:09.513 --> 00:54:11.949 align:middle line:84%
When it comes right
down to it, our minds

00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:14.551 align:middle line:84%
are photons of light, held
in an electromagnetic field.

00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:15.419 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:17.087 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: And so
when you move energy,

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:20.023 align:middle line:84%
when you get the laser going
in the right direction, all

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:21.325 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden all that changes.

00:54:21.325 --> 00:54:22.459 align:middle line:84%
And then your
perception changes.

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.994 align:middle line:84%
And that drives
biochemical changes.

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.329 align:middle line:90%
And then your body is different.

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:27.931 align:middle line:84%
That's why this whole
psychoneuroimmunological thing

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:28.699 align:middle line:90%
is real.

00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:30.267 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
starts with a choice.

00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:32.569 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMS: It starts with
a conscious choice, followed

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:36.106 align:middle line:84%
by subconscious change that
informs the cells in a new way.

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:38.008 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful,
beautiful thing to see.

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:40.344 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one thing I've
heard you say in the past

00:54:40.344 --> 00:54:43.847 align:middle line:84%
is, you've spoken
about the mind.

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:49.353 align:middle line:84%
Taking back our minds is really
the last frontier of freedom.

00:54:49.353 --> 00:54:50.554 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMS: Right.

00:54:50.554 --> 00:54:53.857 align:middle line:84%
I think, in our culture
that give such credence

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:56.426 align:middle line:84%
and importance to money,
and money management,

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:58.495 align:middle line:84%
as a way to feel
safe in the world,

00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:00.564 align:middle line:84%
and to feel in
control of your life,

00:55:00.564 --> 00:55:04.501 align:middle line:84%
I say mind management is way
more important than that.

00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:07.871 align:middle line:84%
And your spiritual development
is the top of that pyramid.

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:09.740 align:middle line:84%
For you to learn
and remember who

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.675 align:middle line:84%
you really are, as
a spiritual being

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:14.811 align:middle line:84%
having a human experience,
not the other way around.

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:16.547 align:middle line:84%
Once you step into
that full-knowing?

00:55:16.547 --> 00:55:19.183 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
biblical reference about,

00:55:19.183 --> 00:55:20.617 align:middle line:84%
first enter the
kingdom of heaven,

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:22.786 align:middle line:84%
then all else will
be given to you?

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:25.189 align:middle line:84%
I say, first enter the
full awareness of who

00:55:25.189 --> 00:55:28.091 align:middle line:84%
you are as a divine being
having a human experience,

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:29.626 align:middle line:84%
and everything you
need to support

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:30.861 align:middle line:90%
that will be given to you.

00:55:30.861 --> 00:55:32.429 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
only a choice away.

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.064 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for your time, Rob.

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely beautiful
work you do.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.068 align:middle line:84%
As we spoke about
before, PSYCH-K

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:40.771 align:middle line:84%
has about 40 certified trainers
around the world for those

00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:44.141 align:middle line:84%
wishing to become facilitators,
and thousands of facilitators,

00:55:44.141 --> 00:55:46.143 align:middle line:84%
if you just need a
little help yourself.

00:55:46.143 --> 00:55:48.278 align:middle line:84%
With the amount of
fear-mongering and tension

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:50.614 align:middle line:84%
surrounding us on a
daily basis, perhaps it

00:55:50.614 --> 00:55:52.816 align:middle line:84%
is time to begin
restructuring what

00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:55.118 align:middle line:84%
lies underneath our
feelings and behavior.

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:59.189 align:middle line:84%
You can connect with PSYCH-K
through P-S-Y-C-H, Psych,

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.757 align:middle line:90%
dash K, dot com.

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:05.629 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
