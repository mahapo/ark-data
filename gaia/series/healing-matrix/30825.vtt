00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
If you're female,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
over 40, married with kids, or
making waves in your career,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
you've probably noticed some
irregularities in your body

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
shape or size, in
your sleep or mood.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
According to Doctor
Sara Gottfried,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
author of "The Hormone
Cure," hormonal imbalances

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
account for most of our weight,
sleep, and mood disorders.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that these imbalances

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
can be corrected naturally,
without pharmaceuticals.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
This means that we can feel
juicy and alive again--

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:84%
if quality of life is a priority
worth putting some education

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:90%
and effort into.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It's so nice to be
sitting with you.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:10%
I think I have
about 100 dog-ears

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:10%
on the pages of your book
because this is actually

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:10%
very useful information.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:10%
And you're getting
a lot of publicity

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:10%
as a result of what you've done.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.121 align:middle line:10%
You're trying to
help women take back

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:10%
their own hormonal health,
which feeds into stress,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of things that--
to the point where virtually

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:10%
everybody needs to
understand these things.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.804 align:middle line:84%
So let's start
with your own story

00:01:30.804 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
because you've been through
your own load of stress.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:90%
You're a braniac.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Harvard, Harvard-trained,
MIT, engineer, doctor.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
You've gone over
into this field now.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Give us your own
background and how

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.382 align:middle line:90%
you ended up in this position.

00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SARA GOTTFRIED: Sure.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, I would
definitely say, Regina,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:10%
that it started with
my great-grandmother.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:10%
I want to honor her
first because she was not

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:10%
the typical grandmother
who shows up

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:10%
at your house with Barbies
and gum, See's candy.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:10%
She showed up with
kale, carob cookies.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:10%
And she was a serious
yogini way before there

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:10%
was a yoga studio on
every street corner.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
And she taught me a
really important lesson,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:84%
which is that you don't
find the answer to health

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:90%
in a prescription pill bottle.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
You find it in how you
craft your lifestyle.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.347 align:middle line:84%
You find it in the way
that you use your fork,

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the way that you eat, move,
think, and supplement.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wise woman.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.678 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Very wise woman.

00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Slept on a board,
outlived four husbands.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But really, it wasn't
until I was in my 30s

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.657 align:middle line:84%
that this really
made sense to me.

00:02:31.657 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And by then, you had
already gone to medical school.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
She said you're not going to
find your answers in a pill,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:90%
yet you went for the pill.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: And then I
went to medical school.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So I went to learn all
about the pills, right?

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: And
that is the nature

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:90%
of conventional medicine.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:84%
We live in a culture--
and the medical industry

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
is part of this--
that believes that you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
do find the answer
in a pill bottle.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:90%
And I disagree with that.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So I had a defining
moment when I was my 30s.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I was practicing McMedicine.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I was working at a health
maintenance organization.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing somewhere
around 30 patients a day.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had what I would
call the four F's.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I was frazzled,
frumpy, fat, and you

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:84%
can imagine what
the fourth F was.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I was not happy.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had PMS, I
had low sex drive.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.592 align:middle line:90%
I felt too young to feel so old.

00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you have
kids by this time?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.725 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: I did

00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:26.308 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:26.308 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So I had
two kids in my 30s.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:90%
I have two daughters.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And honestly,
residency training was

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.977 align:middle line:90%
nothing compared to being a mom.

00:03:35.977 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's brutal.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.675 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: It's brutal.

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brutal hours.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.249 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: And we
don't talk about that.

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
At least in residency, when I
was working 120 hours a week

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and I was on call
every third night,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I had two nights
where I could sleep.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you're a mom and
you step into that role,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and we're wired as
women to over-provide,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to over-accommodate,
to people please.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So for me, when I
became a mother,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:90%
that was a pivotal time.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:90%
And I was such a stress case.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Terrible PMS.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Blamed my husband for most
things, especially in the week

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:90%
before my period.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:90%
And I went to my doctor.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:90%
I did what a lot of women do.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
When I saw my doctor, and
I explained my symptoms,

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
he wrote a prescription
for an antidepressant.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So he offered me Prozac, told me
to exercise more and eat less.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt like this
was exactly the wrong advice.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to have
that moment where

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I realized OK, this legacy
from my great-grandmother, it's

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And I took that
prescription, which

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
just left me feeling
cold, and I decided

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to apply
that medical training

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:90%
to my own body.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at that
time, were you a surgeon?

00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:52.516 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: I was.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I was board-certified
as an OB/GYN.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm still board-certified
as an OB/GYN,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:84%
although my focus is really on
hormones and self-realization,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, I was
doing hysterectomies

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:84%
during the day, prescribing
birth control pills-- which

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I no longer think
is a good idea--

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was delivering
babies at night.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I was burning the
candle at both ends.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:90%
This is not a unique story.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So many women are
experiencing this.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I decided to take
a look at my own hormones,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
when I did what we call here in
the Silicon Valley biohacking,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and really take on my own
physiology, and figure out,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, why do I feel like crap?

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't I do this differently?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%
What I found was that my
cortisol, my main stress

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.610 align:middle line:90%
hormone, was sky high.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It was three times the normal
range, the optimal range.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And that was not something
that my conventional physician

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:90%
would ever test for me.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's what got
me to start thinking

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
about a different way of
approaching the hormonal issues

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:90%
that women have.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to be
overly reductionistic

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and say that all the problems
we face as women and men

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:90%
are hormonal.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:90%
But they're a big part of it.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.671 align:middle line:84%
They really drive what
we're interested in.

00:06:06.671 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
The drive our
metabolism, and our mood,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and whether we have
sugar cravings.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:84%
They drive a lot of our
quality of life day to day.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you
take our lives back,

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:84%
say, maybe five or
six decades, which

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.562 align:middle line:84%
had a different set
of stressors to it.

00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But say you're a
woman, say you're a mother.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Your husband is
selling something

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
or he's going to work somewhere,
and you have a few kids

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.390 align:middle line:90%
to raise.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're making
cakes in the afternoon

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
for when they come
home, and you're

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.680 align:middle line:84%
washing your clothing by hand,
and the way of life then,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
what would a cortisol
profile look like then?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Such
a juicy question.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So the way that I
would answer that

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:90%
is to start first with the data.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe fill
in some of the theory,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:84%
based on what I know from
observing women and men for 20

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
First, we know from
studies that have

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
been done that women are less
happy now than they've ever

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
been in the history
of the world.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a feminist.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that women
bring so much value and so many

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
important things to the table
when it comes to equality.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big fan of women
stepping into their power.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I
really feel like there's

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:90%
a cost to the women's movement.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So dialing back
60 to 70 years, I

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:84%
would say that my
great-grandmother, who

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:84%
was a bit of a
radical, she did not

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
have the cortisol
issues that I have.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
She was not trying to raise
her children in a city

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.597 align:middle line:84%
where she didn't have
any other family.

00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a big part of it.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a big--
the whole breakdown

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%
of family and extended family.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.342 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:84%
We know that Hillary
Clinton famously

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
said it takes a village
to raise a child.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, as a
woman in perimenopause,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that it takes a village
to do most things.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Yes, for sure, with raising a
child, but many of the things

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that we are trying
to do as women.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.681 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just the
sheer comfort of knowing

00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
you have aunts, and sisters,
and grandmothers nearby.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:84%
If your life is in
any kind of stress,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
you have someone to
help share the burden.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Also to talk to, and
confide in, and trust.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.259 align:middle line:90%
Those factors aren't there.

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: They're not there.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
We've really lost a connection
to those intimate relationships

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:90%
with our extended family.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
an important part

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:90%
of how women cope with stress.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
We know that, unfortunately,
stress favors men.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying
that as a feminist,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and it pains me a
bit to say that.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But we know that the way
that we deal with stress

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:90%
is different as women.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:84%
We also, we have some
strategies that I

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
think are more effective than
the strategies that men use,

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:84%
but not all of us are
using those strategies.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
One strategy, for example,
is estrogen and oxytocin.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the classic
stress research that

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:84%
was done in the 1930s by Walter
Cannon at Harvard Medical

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
School, he found that people
go into fight or flight

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
when they have a
stress response.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great system
for dealing with danger--

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
when you're the tiger chasing
after you, for instance.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:84%
But his research
was done in men.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was assumed
to apply to women.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't apply to women.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.933 align:middle line:84%
So some women go
into fight or flight,

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
especially under
physical danger.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to emotional stress,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.757 align:middle line:90%
women respond very differently.

00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More depression?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well, that's one
of the downstream effects,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Certainly women have much
higher rates of depression,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of thyroid problems, of sleep
issues-- double the rate

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:90%
of sleep issues.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We're on twice as
many antidepressants.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:90%
That's another conversation.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
stress response, what

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.424 align:middle line:84%
we know from some of
the research at UCLA

00:09:59.424 --> 00:10:00.840 align:middle line:84%
with Shelley Taylor,
for instance,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:90%
is that women tend and befriend.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So when you call a
girlfriend because you've

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
had a fight with
your darling husband,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.182 align:middle line:84%
it's a very important
hormone therapy

00:10:12.182 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:84%
that you're getting when
you pick up the phone.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.430 align:middle line:90%
You are raising your oxytocin.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.492 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
think that oxytocin

00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:84%
is something that you release
when you have an orgasm

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:90%
or when you breastfeed.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out
that oxytocin is

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
one of the most powerful
ways to lower your cortisol.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.016 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol's that
main stress hormone.

00:10:29.016 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit more
complicated than that,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.765 align:middle line:84%
but I think that's a
good way to describe it.

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can get
it as easily as a hug.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.904 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: So a hug, yes.

00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:10%
There's so many different
ways to raise your oxytocin,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.244 align:middle line:10%
and one of them is hugging.

00:10:41.244 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:10%
I can't remember the name of
the guy who did the Ted talk,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.909 align:middle line:10%
but he talks about
eight hugs a day,

00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:10%
how that's the right
dose if you look

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.216 align:middle line:10%
at the physiology of oxytocin.

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, you have to
hug a man a little bit longer

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
than you have to hug
a woman because we're

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.155 align:middle line:84%
a little better at
making oxytocin.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:56.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, OK.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So hug your
man a little longer.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.031 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Takes them longer
to get the buzz, all right.

00:11:01.031 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So continue on with that.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So the way that our
bodies handled stress then

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
might look like what compared
to what we're now experiencing

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.742 align:middle line:84%
in the modern
lifestyle of today.

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well,
there's a number

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.241 align:middle line:90%
of different differences.

00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think it might
be worthwhile to take

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:90%
on a few of these individually.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Another huge change since
six or seven decades ago

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:90%
is the food that we're eating.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.909 align:middle line:84%
Michael Pollan has
talked about how

00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
if you're confused
about what to eat,

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.717 align:middle line:84%
just eat what your
great-grandparents ate, right?

00:11:33.717 --> 00:11:34.925 align:middle line:90%
That makes such a difference.

00:11:34.925 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.471 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Right?

00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Eat whole foods.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Eat pastured milk.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Eat eggs that are not from
stressed-out chickens,

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:84%
but from chickens
that are happy.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe
that the food industry

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:90%
has changed dramatically.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
reasons for that.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
The cow that you get at Safeway
is very different than the cow

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
that my great-grandmother
was eating

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.822 align:middle line:90%
six or seven decades ago.

00:11:58.822 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
reasons why we have

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
a much higher rate of dairy
allergy, for instance.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We know that gluten has
dramatically changed.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And the way that my
grandmother ate bread,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.890 align:middle line:90%
it was often made by hand.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
There's almost a meditative
quality to making bread.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
locally milled grain.

00:12:18.585 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Locally
milled grain.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And what we have now is
bread that has bromide in it,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.100 align:middle line:84%
which causes a number of
problems with your thyroid.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It has a form of gluten
that is inflammatory.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To create
fluffy white bread.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Fluffy white bread.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.995 align:middle line:84%
There's a big difference in
terms of the food industry.

00:12:39.995 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get on a
soapbox about just that.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But we've got all
these different drivers

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:90%
of inflammation.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.519 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol's one of them,
being more stressed.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
My great-grandmother
didn't have an iPhone,

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.804 align:middle line:84%
for instance, which is a
blessing and curse, right?

00:12:55.804 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.094 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: I can
do GPS for the Soul,

00:12:58.094 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and I can actually monitor
my stress response now.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But my grandmother
didn't need to do

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.756 align:middle line:84%
that six or seven
decades ago like I do.

00:13:06.756 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't have someone
texting her and calling

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:90%
her the way that I do.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So women, I think,
are more overwhelmed.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we have an
epidemic of women

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
who feel stressed
out and overwhelmed.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little chubbier
than they want.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:90%
More mood issues.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And the root of it
is hormone imbalance.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn
nothing else today,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
but that's a really
important message, I think.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
That it's not you,
it's your hormones.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Which you address in
great detail, every hormone,

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:10%
every way to approach it in
a natural way, in your book.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:10%
You've done a
beautiful job of that.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:10%
We're going to get into some
of the really key hormones

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:10%
and how you can manage them
naturally rather than go

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.634 align:middle line:10%
get a pill for your depression.

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And one thing
you're talking about

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:84%
is I'm noticing among women
more and more, as time goes on,

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.122 align:middle line:84%
there's a kind of
hypervigilance going on now.

00:14:03.122 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't know
any other word for it.

00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:08.969 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're on alert all
the time, watching over this,

00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:90%
watching over that.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Making sure it all
comes together,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:84%
the house, the home, the
kids, the commuting, whatever,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
comes together.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
That seems to me to be one
of the greatest stressors,

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.014 align:middle line:90%
is the mind never just relaxes.

00:14:22.014 --> 00:14:23.680 align:middle line:84%
You go to bed, you're
running your list.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
You wake up, you have
a list waiting for you.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, this affects men too.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
But we know that women
tend to multitask and take

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
on more responsibility
when it comes

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to the domestic and
child-rearing aspects

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.527 align:middle line:84%
So of course, more
hypervigilance.

00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Definitely
more hypervigilance.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.052 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:14:42.052 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
nervous system--

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I like to make this
astonishingly easy

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:84%
because you can have your eyes
glaze over pretty fast when

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
biochemistry or genetics,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and how it interacts
with the environment.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
the nervous system,

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.509 align:middle line:84%
the way that I think
about it really

00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
simply is that you've
got an on button

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:90%
and you've got an off button.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
The on button is the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.947 align:middle line:84%
It's what it allows
us to deal with, say,

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
the alarm that
went off in my home

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
on Saturday night when my
husband was out of town.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And when that alarm went off,
I went into hypervigilance.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.801 align:middle line:84%
I could feel my cortisol
going through the roof.

00:15:20.801 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I was certain that there was a
robber or something happening

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:90%
upstairs.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.590 align:middle line:90%
I had my two daughters here.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I felt really vulnerable.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not the best situation
for me as a woman.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
The female matrix doesn't do
that well being the protector.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:84%
When my husband's here,
and he's lying by my side,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:90%
and the alarm goes off?

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that same response.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I can actually go back to
bed after he goes and deals

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So you're absolutely right
about this hypervigilance.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:84%
We are really good
at this on button.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
We're not so good
at the off button.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So the off button is the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And we want this lovely
dance between the two,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
like a tango, where
you're not in hyperdrive,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
you're not constantly
pushing that on button.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.105 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are like race
car drivers, I think.

00:16:09.105 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you a male
analogy, how about that?

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think of race
car drivers, I

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.540 align:middle line:84%
think about how
their mastery doesn't

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
come from pressing the
pedal to the metal.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:84%
It comes from knowing when
to take a strategic break.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It comes from figuring
out I need a pit stop.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I need some new tires.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I need to know when to hit the
pause button so that I really

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:36.000 align:middle line:84%
have mastery around my
success as a race car driver.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to really focus
on that off button, something

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that I think you've
done so beautifully,

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Regina, in your career.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like when I have a
woman who comes and sees me

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
in my practice--
and I'll tell you

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:90%
about one that I saw this week.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I have a woman named
Joan, who is 47 years old.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And she came to me and she said,
"I would rather do anything

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:90%
than have sex with my husband.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:90%
I would rather be on Facebook.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather garden.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather drink a smoothie.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's affecting our marriage.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:90%
I feel really bad about it.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:90%
I love my husband.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like I am
such as stress case.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm running around,
task to task,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.702 align:middle line:84%
not able to slow down and
enjoy sex with my husband.

00:17:24.702 --> 00:17:26.785 align:middle line:84%
Can't you just give you
some of that testosterone?

00:17:26.785 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I heard testosterone
would help."

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So here again, she's talking
about a bioidentical hormone,

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
but she's jumping
to the prescription.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so
important to look at,

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
upstream, what are
the root causes.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
find the root cause

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:84%
rather than being in a
rush to mask the symptom,

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that's where you're more
likely to have a cure.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
You're more likely to create
this good neighborhood.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So what we found with her
was that her cortisol,

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
similar to mine in my 30s,
was quite high in the morning.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And then it was quite
low in the afternoon.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And it made her have this
brain fog, like low energy

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.570 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
figured out was a way

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:84%
to manage her cortisol
so that we could get it

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.030 align:middle line:84%
into that Goldilocks
position in the morning.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Not too high.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.204 align:middle line:84%
Not that tired, but
wired stress feeling

00:18:17.204 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
where you're
hypervigilant, right?

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A terrible
feeling, yeah.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.763 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: And then in the
afternoon when she has that

00:18:22.763 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:84%
brain fog and she's
reaching for, I don't know--

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A mocha.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: --a
latte, chocolate,

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
anything-- what we did there
is we actually had her start

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:84%
doing a form of exercise
that would help her

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.692 align:middle line:84%
with her cortisol levels
and reduce the sugar

00:18:37.692 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:90%
cravings that she was having.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's really
key because all exercise is not

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.755 align:middle line:90%
equal.

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Absolutely.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.264 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially
depending on your own profile.

00:18:46.264 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Some are jacking up cortisol
and some are soothing it, right?

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So true, and I
think we don't realize this.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
We've got this idea
that one size fits

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
all when it comes to
our health, and nothing

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.360 align:middle line:90%
could be further from the truth.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.244 align:middle line:84%
We've really got to figure out
how do we calibrate for you.

00:19:02.244 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened to this lady?

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So you get her on
appropriate exercise

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
afternoon instead of caffeine.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So we
changed her cortisol.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And the cool part
here is that when

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.790 align:middle line:84%
you change the root cause,
and her high cortisol

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, low cortisol
in the afternoon, what we found

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:84%
was that we were able to get
her other hormones into balance.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So in her situation,
she had what

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I would call a problem with
hormonal Charlie's Angels.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Can I mention that, too?

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.106 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:19:33.106 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: When I was
going through this biohacking

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
exercise in my
30s, and I realized

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that my cortisol was high.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
why I was gaining weight

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:84%
was because my thyroid
wasn't working well.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:90%
It was low.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:90%
I also had estrogen dominance.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I had pretty much every problem
a woman could have, hormonally.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And I came to this conclusion.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I had another epiphany, which
is that you want three hormones

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.155 align:middle line:90%
in particular to support you.

00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
place where I

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:84%
love to keep it
astonishingly simple.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
These are your hormonal
Charlie's Angels.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
They are cortisol,
estrogen, and thyroid.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
In men, I like to always give
the men a little something

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:90%
to think about.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:84%
In men, it's a
little bit different.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:84%
It's cortisol,
testosterone, thyroid.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
If you have those three
hormones working for you, not

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.912 align:middle line:84%
against you, you are going to
be able to feel so much better.

00:20:26.912 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Like you're living
life fully, like

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.995 align:middle line:84%
you're able to rock
your mission and be

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:90%
of service in a whole new way.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So what we did with this woman
was we worked on the cortisol.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That actually
helped her thyroid.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
the two are intertwined.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.636 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: They
are intertwined.

00:20:41.636 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
When one goes up,
the other goes down.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And thyroid has a lot
of important roles.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
We know that 20% of
people with depression

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:90%
have low thyroid function.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me crazy when
someone comes to see me.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
They get started on
an antidepressant

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and no one ever
checked their thyroid.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:90%
So we want to think about that.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
The other piece for
her is that her thyroid

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
was a big part of
her low sex drive.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So she had hypervigilance,
low thyroid function,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:90%
and she was 47.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So she was right
at that age where

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:84%
I think about it as a
perfect storm, where

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:84%
you have a problem
with all three

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.410 align:middle line:84%
of these hormonal
Charlie's Angels.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So in her situation,
her estrogen was lower.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.810 align:middle line:84%
It was causing some
vaginal dryness.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of the reason why

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:90%
she wasn't enjoying sex as much.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Her orgasms had changed.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The lining of her lady
garden, her female genitalia,

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:90%
was starting to change.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Testosterone was lower
because of the high cortisol.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to the root
cause and you fix the cortisol,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful thing
is the crosstalk

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:90%
between these hormones.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.414 align:middle line:84%
So when we did that,
when we got her cortisol

00:21:52.414 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to support her
again, her thyroid

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:90%
got into the optimal range.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Her estrogen balance got better.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
We did a little bit of
local therapy in the vagina

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.435 align:middle line:84%
with some bioidentical,
lowest dose estrogen.

00:22:08.435 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Creams.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: And it
made a big difference

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.441 align:middle line:90%
with the vaginal dryness.

00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:13.274 align:middle line:90%
It also helped her orgasms.

00:22:13.274 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So
one of the things

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that she didn't tell
me when we first

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
started talking is that she
had always really enjoyed sex.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And she really enjoyed the
orgasms that she would have.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And she felt like in
her 40s, the orgasms

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:90%
were just slowly fading.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They weren't toe-curling
like they were in the past,

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:90%
in her 20s and in her 30s.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And she could barely even notice
if she was having an orgasm.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was
an estrogen effect.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.411 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too much estrogen?

00:22:45.411 --> 00:22:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: It's a little
bit more complicated.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:84%
In her situation,
she was actually low

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:84%
in estrogen, which is
why she had the dryness.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But you're right that just
as when I was in my 30s

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and I had estrogen
dominance, which is common--

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
it's about 70 to 80% of women
between the ages of 35 and 45--

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that's the first part
of perimenopause.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:90%
So phase one, perimenopause.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Your progesterone
is low, and you

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.080 align:middle line:90%
get into estrogen dominance.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:90%
It's another tango.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:84%
You want a really nice
ratio between progesterone

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and estrogen.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Estrogen's like that.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the archetypal
feminine hormone.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.445 align:middle line:84%
It gives us breasts,
and hips, and makes

00:23:25.445 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
us juicy in our
joints, in our vagina.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And progesterone is
like that stable partner

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:90%
that you can really rely on.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It soothes you.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:90%
You feel protected.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Protects your uterus.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Helps you calm down.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like nature's Valium.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
happens between 35 and 45

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:84%
is that your ovaries don't
make as much progesterone.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of women feel this,
like it's harder to calm down.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
They have that
hypervigilance, right?

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And don't sleep well.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: They
don't sleep well,

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and then they get
into this spiral.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.706 align:middle line:84%
When you don't sleep well,
it raises your cortisol.

00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Then you start drinking
coffee in the morning

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's all you can think
about when you wake up.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or taking Ambien
or some drug at night.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Or taking
a sleeping pill.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:84%
When you don't sleep well
at night, raises cortisol.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
looking for sugar,

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
because it can make you
have sugar cravings.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:84%
It can give you
problems with insulin.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And when insulin starts to rise,
as it does when cortisol starts

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:84%
to rise, that makes you lay
down more fat, especially right

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:90%
here at the muffin top.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's this whole
vicious cycle that happens.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:10%
And what I really want
women to understand

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:10%
is that you're not
doing anything wrong.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:10%
There's probably a
biological reason

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:10%
why you feel overwhelmed,
why you feel hypervigilant.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter of
you're missing the mark.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I want you to start
with the biology.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a really
important message.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you've
helped thousands

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.637 align:middle line:84%
of women on this level
already, haven't you?

00:24:51.637 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well, I've
been very fortunate.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:10%
I've been seeing
patients for awhile.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:10%
I started at Harvard
Medical School in 1989.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:10%
Actually, I moved
there from Alaska.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.489 align:middle line:10%
There are not many Alaskans who
go to Harvard Medical School.

00:25:05.489 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: No.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's even this
attitude in Alaska--

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I moved from Maryland
to Alaska when I was 10.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
There's an attitude in Alaska
that if you go to an Ivy League

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:90%
school, you need to overcome it.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So I don't come to you
as I'm from Harvard.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:90%
I have some modesty around this.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:84%
You were just talking about
muffin tops a little bit ago.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes, muffin tops.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, when we were
talking about this cycle of

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
stressed out female
hormones, and some

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of the primary
players-- and we're

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.930 align:middle line:84%
going to go into a couple of
them in more detail in a bit.

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.312 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
psychological factor.

00:25:44.312 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is when
your great-grandmother hit

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:84%
her 50s, 60s, and 70s,
she wasn't expecting

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:84%
to look like she did in her
20s and 30s, which we do now.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are we
totally delusional?

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, should this
even be a goal?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.620 align:middle line:84%
You're wearing tight
jeans at 50, 60, and 70.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you're upset because
you have a muffin top?

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.270 align:middle line:84%
What's going on here
psychologically,

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.936 align:middle line:84%
and how much of this do you have
to deal with with your clients?

00:26:14.936 --> 00:26:17.844 align:middle line:90%
Just their own self-perception.

00:26:17.844 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well,
in some ways, I

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.040 align:middle line:84%
don't think we need patriarchal
society to hold us back anymore

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:90%
because we do it to ourselves.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're surrounded by all
of these images and media--

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
everyone knows this-- of
the ideal of the female form

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.104 align:middle line:84%
being what I would call
an anorexic adolescent.

00:26:37.104 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 6 feet
tall, 115 pounds.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: 6 feet tall, a
freak of nature, honestly.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A genetic mutation.

00:26:42.375 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So
someone who's got

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:48.170 align:middle line:84%
DNA that makes them incredibly
tall, not have much fat at all

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:90%
on their body.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's a completely
unattainable ideal.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I do feel like
we need to be empowered

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
around understanding what
it looks like to nurture

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:90%
ourselves, to nourish ourselves.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all have
different ways to do that.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:84%
For some people,
it's meditation.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:84%
For some people,
it's learning how

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.630 align:middle line:84%
to hit that pause
button, the off button.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to this
standard that we have for

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:84%
ourselves-- and you mentioned
my great-grandmother.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:84%
She was not wearing skinny
jeans, you're absolutely right.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.294 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have
low-rise jeans or need

00:27:24.294 --> 00:27:25.460 align:middle line:90%
to worry about a muffin top.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have a
muffin top because I

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
think her cortisol was right
in that Goldilocks position--

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.440 align:middle line:90%
not too high, not too low.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But she also wasn't
feeling pressure

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:84%
to look like she was
25 when she was 50.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
big one, the damage

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.940 align:middle line:84%
it does on the psyche
of women to try

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:84%
to attain this thing that's
really unattainable by way

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:84%
of imagery, by what's put
out by Madison Avenue.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I know very few
women they don't have

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:84%
a fair amount of self-loathing
about their bodies,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.494 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
are very beautiful.

00:27:57.494 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: It's very true.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a disconnect
between who we are

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:90%
and who we feel we should be.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let me
ask you then on that.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
If you were to go back to an
era and look at Hollywood--

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:84%
let's say Hollywood maybe
in a purer sense, where

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.090 align:middle line:84%
you have people from the
town and community, and even

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Aunt Bea thrown in there.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.340 align:middle line:84%
If you looked at women
from another time,

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
where would you say a
standard healthy female form

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.326 align:middle line:90%
actually existed?

00:28:30.326 --> 00:28:34.022 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.022 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there's
no standard among women,

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:84%
but what era would
we look to where

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.039 align:middle line:84%
that's natural-- some
people worked on the farm,

00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:84%
some people have to walk
because they didn't have cars.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It was just a more
organic kind of lifestyle,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily focused on
oh, I've got to lose weight.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Sure.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
there's-- we've gone--

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.340 align:middle line:84%
the pendulum swings
back and forth, right?

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.986 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: You can think of
the flappers in the '20s who

00:28:56.986 --> 00:28:58.580 align:middle line:84%
were really skinny,
had no breasts,

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
and had almost no estrogen.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.092 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
the healthiest form.

00:29:03.092 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I also think Twiggy in the '60s
is not the healthiest form.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
was not healthy.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.711 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: So it's not those.

00:29:07.711 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll start with the
process of elimination.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.985 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I thought of
when you asked this question

00:29:11.985 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:84%
was actually an
African tribe, where

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:84%
the elders, the women who
were over the age of 50,

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.650 align:middle line:84%
the menopausal women,
teach young men

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:90%
how to please women sexually.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Now to me, that's the best
use of the female form.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Doesn't that
sound like a great tribe?

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:31.995 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: But to get to
your question about Hollywood

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and what's healthy.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
When I think about
the Victorian era,

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:44.074 align:middle line:84%
when I think about
the form of women

00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:48.142 align:middle line:84%
when it was valued for them
to have more fat on them,

00:29:48.142 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily think
that that was so good

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:84%
either because many of those
women were wearing corsets.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.534 align:middle line:84%
They were choking in
their ribs so tight

00:29:55.534 --> 00:29:56.825 align:middle line:90%
that they could barely breathe.

00:29:56.825 --> 00:29:59.449 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't know then
you can just have them removed.

00:29:59.449 --> 00:30:02.329 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.329 --> 00:30:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Right.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Look at how popular Spanx are.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we're
so different now.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I think
is important to me

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:84%
is a level of
freedom, and a level

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:84%
of being able to authentically
pursue your dream,

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:90%
whatever that is.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I think in terms of
Hollywood, of Kate Hepburn.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.900 align:middle line:90%
I think of Meryl Streep.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.265 align:middle line:84%
I am riveted every time
I watch Meryl Streep.

00:30:26.265 --> 00:30:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter what
role she's playing.

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:84%
She can be Maggie Thatcher
with Alzheimer's disease

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:90%
and I am crazy for her.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind if she's got 10
or 20 extra pounds on her.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:90%
I think she looks glorious.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.150 align:middle line:90%
She is radiant.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's
more about agency.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It's more about freedom
and empowerment.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Really, women having
more choices, not fewer.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So if we're trying to weigh
120 pounds maybe 5 foot 5,

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:90%
there's a cost to that.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
If you go on Atkins because
you're trying to lose your fat,

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:90%
that raises cortisol.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that cortisol
not just depletes you

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.900 align:middle line:84%
of your happy brain chemicals
and gives you a muffin top,

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:84%
it also accelerates
the aging of your skin.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So it affects the
skin about 20 x more

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:90%
than other parts of your body.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
a place where I

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:26.840 align:middle line:84%
think hormone balance and
health is present outside.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a reflection of
what's happening inside.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.219 align:middle line:84%
Your skin is a mirror of
what's happening in your mind.

00:31:32.219 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good point

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So I think that's
an important piece as well.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:35.491 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:35.491 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's start looking at
some of the simple things.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to more on
a chemical level in the body.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:84%
When we look at some
of the top interrupters

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.560 align:middle line:84%
for balanced hormones,
what are some of the things

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.255 align:middle line:90%
that we take in?

00:31:50.255 --> 00:31:51.390 align:middle line:90%
You say fork.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
The fork to the mouth is
really an important part.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And look at where the
interrupters are happening

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and then look at how we
can begin restoring them.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.330 align:middle line:84%
How we can begin restoring
cortisol naturally.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:90%
You talked about this one case.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
things we can do too.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.309 align:middle line:84%
There are herbal
remedies as well.

00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to get
into some of them

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.610 align:middle line:84%
so people can see
themselves in this story.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Sure, sure.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
it's important to say

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that the cool part here is
this isn't some huge project.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Small hinges swing big doors.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really happy
to talk about what's

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.840 align:middle line:84%
proven and also these smaller
things that you can be doing.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe as you listen today,
maybe what I would want,

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:84%
what I would prescribe, is
to pick one or two things

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about today.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So the other piece that
I think is important

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:84%
is that when it comes
to hormone imbalance,

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to
rebalance your hormones

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:84%
than to live with the
misery of hormone imbalance.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's an important
piece to take away as well.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to what do you
do, what are the interruptors,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I think about the interrupters
in a systematic way.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're really
big on scientific studies.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Huge.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I want to
just say that for you

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that it's not
conjecture on your part.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.385 align:middle line:84%
You really follow what
works by way of the studies.

00:33:09.385 --> 00:33:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well, this
is an important piece

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.820 align:middle line:84%
that you're raising,
because not only do I

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.300 align:middle line:84%
believe that women
deserve the best

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:84%
evidence behind any
recommendation that's made.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:84%
That's true for
men too, but women

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.640 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that were part of
this vast, uncontrolled medical

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.020 align:middle line:84%
experiment for 57 years
in the United States.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:84%
When Premarin was one of the
most popular prescriptions.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So it's a form
of estrogen that was used.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.925 align:middle line:84%
Women were promised that they
would stay feminine forever

00:33:37.925 --> 00:33:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and young forever if they
took this prescription.

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And oh, by the way, it causes
endometrial cancer, cancer

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:84%
of the uterus, cancer
of the breasts,

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:49.100 align:middle line:84%
increases your risk
of heart disease.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know that until
we did the best type of study,

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:90%
which is a randomized trial.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was not
done until 1999.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:84%
The next study was done in
2002, which most people know

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:84%
about the Women's
Health Initiative.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But 57 years of a vast,
uncontrolled medical experiment

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.960 align:middle line:90%
on women.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's shameful.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I was part of the conventional
medical training that was not

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.284 align:middle line:84%
just suggesting
conventional hormone

00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:18.159 align:middle line:84%
therapy, synthetic
hormone therapy, to women,

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.820 align:middle line:90%
but proselytizing.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So I really feel like
we've got a high bar now

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
in medicine to keep
women safe when

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:90%
it comes to these interventions.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So let's get to some
of those interventions.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to your fork,
we'll start with that.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
Maybe how you eat, move,
think, and supplement.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.650 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to your fork,
some of the worst players,

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
the interrupters are
dairy, especially

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:90%
conventional cow dairy.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:48.639 align:middle line:90%
Not organic.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.055 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Not
raw, necessarily.

00:34:50.055 --> 00:34:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have a
different spectrum.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Not
raw necessarily.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a different spectrum.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:58.040 align:middle line:84%
When it comes from
goats and sheep,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.380 align:middle line:84%
that's better, less
allergenic, less likely

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.410 align:middle line:84%
to create a bad
neighborhood in your body.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It's all about if we look at
personalized medicine, which

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:84%
is where we're going
in the next 10 years.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:90%
It's the future of medicine.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Where we know in 2015 that it's
going to cost you about $100

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.955 align:middle line:84%
to test your DNA,
which is super cool.

00:35:14.955 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Right now it costs
about $10,000.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.746 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that is very cool.

00:35:17.746 --> 00:35:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: And
the interesting part

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:25.180 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not just your DNA
that determines your health.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:84%
It is the way you
construct your life.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the supplements you
take, it's the amount of sleep

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:36.220 align:middle line:84%
50 to 80% of how
your DNA is expressed

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.710 align:middle line:84%
is based on those four factors,
how you eat, move, think,

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:middle line:90%
and supplement.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.444 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
incredible opportunity.

00:35:41.444 --> 00:35:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.100 align:middle line:84%
The field of epigenetics
is really growing fast.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: So cool.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bruce Lipton,
of course, is our guru.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.170 align:middle line:84%
He's done so much to really
help the public at large

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:90%
understand this.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:51.908 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:35:51.908 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you're not
a victim of your genes.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Exactly.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:84%
This is opportunity, so
step into your power.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So these are interruptors,
there's so many of them.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, how much
time do we have?

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we have dairy.

00:36:02.545 --> 00:36:04.204 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about processed dairy.

00:36:04.204 --> 00:36:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED:
Processed foods, yes.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about the
big agricultural industry

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.830 align:middle line:84%
in the US, and how they have
hijacked our hormonal health.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:15.780 align:middle line:84%
They are increasing the
problems in our gut.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.370 align:middle line:84%
We have more genes
in our gut than we

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.996 align:middle line:90%
do anywhere else in our body.

00:36:18.996 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to be paying
attention to these things.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So dairy, gluten I
mentioned as well.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Sugar.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I consider sugar to be
like a drive-by shooting.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.896 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
hyperbolic, but I really

00:36:31.896 --> 00:36:32.770 align:middle line:90%
think it's important.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:34.145 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Sara,
every person I've

00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:37.160 align:middle line:10%
interviewed that is in
the field of natural ways

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:10%
to recover our health has
said exactly the same thing

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.486 align:middle line:10%
without such dramatic terms.

00:36:41.486 --> 00:36:44.170 align:middle line:10%
And which is very bad
news for sugar babies who

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.820 align:middle line:10%
just love having a little sugar.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:10%
But let's talk about that.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:10%
What is it doing?

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.700 align:middle line:10%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well, my heart
goes out to these people.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.550 align:middle line:10%
I used to hear
jungle drums when I

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.920 align:middle line:10%
was in my 30s, when I was that
four F, stressed out, working

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.000 align:middle line:10%
mom.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle line:10%
I know what this feels
like, and I'm not

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.720 align:middle line:10%
saying this with any
sort of judgment.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We've got to turn
this ship around.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:10%
So when it comes
to sugar cravings,

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:13.220 align:middle line:10%
I just did a survey
of my community

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.560 align:middle line:10%
at saragottfriedmd.com.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:10%
I've got a total
of 30,000, mostly

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle line:10%
women, who responded to
this survey just last month.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that the top
three issues they're facing

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:32.030 align:middle line:84%
are sugar cravings, low
or inconsistent energy,

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.920 align:middle line:90%
and problems with stress.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Just feeling like they can't get
on top of the stress machine.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three
issues, and some of these

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:90%
are actually conflated.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that
cortisol is a big part

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.820 align:middle line:84%
of why people have
sugar cravings.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.320 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a
really juicy one,

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
so maybe we could
talk about some

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.630 align:middle line:84%
of the natural ways
of dealing with this.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's do.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.503 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So when you have
sugar, one of the problems

00:37:55.503 --> 00:38:00.080 align:middle line:84%
is that when you have a big
old chunk of chocolate cake--

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and no one loves
chocolate like I do.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to actually
have the dark chocolate cacao.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.712 align:middle line:90%
That lowers cortisol.

00:38:08.712 --> 00:38:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:90%
The natural cacao?

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:90%
So this is super cool.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it doesn't
taste good all by itself.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to sweeten it with
something to make that go down.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So we should have
a conversation about that,

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.236 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So
to me, this is one

00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:84%
of the most exciting
randomized trials that's

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.569 align:middle line:84%
ever been done in the history
of looking at cortisol.

00:38:28.569 --> 00:38:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fabulous.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.401 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: To show that
dark chocolate actually

00:38:31.401 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:90%
lowers cortisol.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So the idea here
is that you want

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.320 align:middle line:84%
to limit the amount of sugar
that's in that dark chocolate.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Eating pure cacao is not
everyone's cup of tea.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: But if you
get a really fine, organic,

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:53.692 align:middle line:84%
raw chocolate bar that
is 80% to 90% cacao,

00:38:53.692 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
that really helps you
with your cortisol level.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:57.456 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
helps lower cortisol.

00:38:57.456 --> 00:38:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: It does.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the study
that you talked about

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.540 align:middle line:90%
by Nestle's corporation?

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.247 align:middle line:90%
That was a different one.

00:39:04.247 --> 00:39:06.205 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well, this
is a randomized trial--

00:39:06.205 --> 00:39:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:07.906 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: --that
actually shows

00:39:07.906 --> 00:39:09.580 align:middle line:90%
that dark chocolate does this.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: God, that's great.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.391 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So we're not
talking about milk chocolate.

00:39:12.391 --> 00:39:14.750 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about having
a ton of sugar in there.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:15.291 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:17.187 align:middle line:84%
Talking 80% and above
solid cocoa mass.

00:39:17.187 --> 00:39:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: That's right.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cacao mass.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.323 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: That's right.

00:39:20.323 --> 00:39:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you are eating a big
old hunk of chocolate cake

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:26.780 align:middle line:84%
or you're choosing a doughnut,
that raises your cortisol.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's an interrupter.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.811 align:middle line:84%
And then along the same
continuum is actually alcohol.

00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:33.435 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about
alcohol for a moment?

00:39:33.435 --> 00:39:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.886 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: This is a
really important interrupter,

00:39:35.886 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:84%
especially in the female body,
the female matrix that I think

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:42.140 align:middle line:84%
of in a functional
medicine perspective.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.970 align:middle line:90%
So alcohol.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Going back to when I was in my
30s-- I think a lot of women

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.520 align:middle line:84%
can relate to this-- when
I came home and was trying

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.090 align:middle line:84%
to transition to being a mom,
came home for the second shift,

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: What I
wanted more than anything

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.277 align:middle line:90%
was a glass of wine.

00:40:01.277 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:90%
So I would pour a glass of wine.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd start making dinner and
connecting with my family.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe I'd
have another glass.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of that
whole vicious cycle that

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:84%
led to me gaining
weight in my 30s.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.990 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that in the female
body, the very thing that you

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:84%
think you're getting
from alcohol,

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.500 align:middle line:90%
it's actually robbing from you.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So you think that you're
hitting that pause

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:90%
button with the alcohol.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.290 align:middle line:84%
You think that
you're calming down.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that the alcohol

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.464 align:middle line:84%
is raising your
cortisol and disrupting

00:40:31.464 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:90%
your sleep that night.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That makes
sense because I

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.469 align:middle line:90%
don't drink much at all.

00:40:34.469 --> 00:40:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I never have and when on
the rare occasion that I do,

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I have the worst sleep.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought,
what's up with that?

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
raising your cortisol,

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.010 align:middle line:90%
which is messing up your sleep.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: It is.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.204 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: I find that
most paths lead back

00:40:47.204 --> 00:40:48.430 align:middle line:90%
to cortisol, right?

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol's this really
interesting hormone

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that is in charge of all these
other hormones, your hormonal

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Charlie's Angels.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.424 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
when they have alcohol,

00:40:57.424 --> 00:41:00.090 align:middle line:84%
they'll fall asleep more easily,
but they don't have deep sleep.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
stay asleep, right.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: You don't
have high quality sleep.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:84%
The other piece that's
important for women

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.480 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a new
study that came out

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.820 align:middle line:84%
in 2011, in the
Nurses' Health Study,

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.710 align:middle line:84%
showing that women who
have more than three

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.490 align:middle line:84%
to six servings
a week of alcohol

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:19.290 align:middle line:84%
have a greater risk
of breast cancer.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the first time
such a small amount of alcohol

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:25.951 align:middle line:84%
has been shown to increase
your bad estrogens.

00:41:25.951 --> 00:41:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which makes
sense if you're also

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.830 align:middle line:90%
jacking up your cortisol.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And cortisol's always
comes back as implicated

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.615 align:middle line:84%
in the development of
certain cancers, right?

00:41:33.615 --> 00:41:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: That's right.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.858 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:41:35.858 --> 00:41:37.067 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard that before.

00:41:37.067 --> 00:41:38.899 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So this
is all part of creating

00:41:38.899 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:90%
the bad neighborhood.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.869 align:middle line:84%
We used to think about
things like breast cancer

00:41:41.869 --> 00:41:43.660 align:middle line:84%
as being-- this is
something that I learned

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.550 align:middle line:84%
from Susan Love, who has been
one of my mentors for a while.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.060 align:middle line:84%
She's a breast cancer
advocate and surgeon.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we used
to think, 20 years ago,

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that you would have
a breast cancer cell.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.197 align:middle line:90%
And it would divide.

00:41:56.197 --> 00:41:57.530 align:middle line:90%
You'd have these daughter cells.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It would turn into a
mass that you would maybe

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
see on a mammogram, or you
would detect clinically,

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.180 align:middle line:90%
or feel it yourself.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.270 align:middle line:90%
And we don't think that anymore.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:10.010 align:middle line:84%
What we think now is that
we all have mutated cells

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.230 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.172 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of
what kind of neighborhood

00:42:13.172 --> 00:42:14.505 align:middle line:90%
you're creating for those cells.

00:42:14.505 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The environment.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: The environment.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you are creating
a good neighborhood,

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:90%
you have the girl scouts.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You have healthy, beautiful
vegetables every day,

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:90%
five to seven colors.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You're moderating how
much alcohol you have.

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:29.910 align:middle line:84%
You're eating the dark
chocolate, but not

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.210 align:middle line:90%
two bars or one bar.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.170 align:middle line:84%
You're having a
couple of squares.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.480 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, you're
creating a good neighborhood.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're someone who's
hearing jungle drums unless you

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.230 align:middle line:84%
have a doughnut, and cortisol
is running like crazy,

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're drinking
more than the right dose

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
of coffee in the morning, you
are down that slippery slope

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.910 align:middle line:90%
of creating a bad neighborhood.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is not a
good epigenetic thing.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.051 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:54.051 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for that.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the just
distinguishing also

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.701 align:middle line:84%
between the chocolate
cake versus the 80 to 90%

00:43:02.701 --> 00:43:05.200 align:middle line:84%
couple of squares of chocolate
and what it does to cortisol.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well, we
need substitutes, right?

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We need substitute.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: I'm not a big
fan of depriving women.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.475 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No no, I'm not either.

00:43:09.475 --> 00:43:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's an
excellent substitute.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into some
other areas as well.

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you said early
on-- let's talk a little bit,

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:21.900 align:middle line:84%
because I want to take the time
to go through some of the more

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.825 align:middle line:84%
natural ways to approach
birth control, for example.

00:43:24.825 --> 00:43:25.635 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:43:25.635 --> 00:43:28.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You're not a fan of
birth control pills anymore.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:33.254 align:middle line:10%
What long term,
by way of studies,

00:43:33.254 --> 00:43:35.170 align:middle line:10%
have they found out about
birth control pills?

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.961 align:middle line:10%
And what are you noticing
in the women that

00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:38.629 align:middle line:10%
have been on them for
quite a long time?

00:43:38.629 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well,
there's some brand

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:42.128 align:middle line:10%
new data about birth
control pills that I think

00:43:42.128 --> 00:43:45.180 align:middle line:10%
are so important to talk about
because no one is talking

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.720 align:middle line:10%
about this.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.520 align:middle line:10%
We've known for a long time that
when you go on a birth control

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:55.010 align:middle line:10%
pill, it actually robs
you of testosterone.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So the birth control pill
is another synthetic form

00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:59.540 align:middle line:90%
of estrogen and progesterone.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.937 align:middle line:84%
When you go on it, it
raises another hormone.

00:44:01.937 --> 00:44:04.020 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that your
audience is sophisticated,

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.436 align:middle line:84%
so I'll just mention
this hormone.

00:44:05.436 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It's called sex hormone
binding globulin.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a sponge
that basically soaks up

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.830 align:middle line:84%
the free testosterone
in your body.

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And the great irony here is that
for women who are having sex,

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:22.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe for the first time,
maybe they're 22 years old

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and having sex for
the first time,

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:27.200 align:middle line:90%
they've got this normal libido.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.910 align:middle line:84%
They go on the
birth control pill.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Their testosterone goes from
normal down to almost nothing.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to have sex.

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
it actually affects

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.940 align:middle line:90%
the receptors in their vagina.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And 20% have vaginal dryness.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:45.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At 20, 25 years old.

00:44:45.955 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: And
they're thinking,

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.260 align:middle line:84%
why am I having these symptoms
that my mother is having,

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.620 align:middle line:90%
who's going through menopause?

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.328 align:middle line:10%
Or they feel like
they're doing something

00:44:52.328 --> 00:44:54.080 align:middle line:10%
wrong because nobody
talks about this.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:59.510 align:middle line:10%
They also have up to 20%
shrinkage of their clitoris

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.380 align:middle line:10%
as a result of this
change in your hormones.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.590 align:middle line:10%
So no, I'm not a big fan
of the birth control pill.

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.170 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to mess
with what I think

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.216 align:middle line:10%
is the innate
intelligence of the body.

00:45:09.216 --> 00:45:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We've got to figure
out how do we

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.740 align:middle line:84%
work with the innate
intelligence of the body,

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:13.470 align:middle line:90%
not against it.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in this day,
what do you recommend?

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: I'm a big
fan of barrier methods.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.140 align:middle line:84%
The problem here is that we
don't have enough options.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.134 align:middle line:90%
We need more options.

00:45:22.134 --> 00:45:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So condoms--

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:24.633 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Vasectomy
is my favorite.

00:45:24.633 --> 00:45:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But if we're talking
about a 20-something,

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I would say consider
the copper IUD.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.380 align:middle line:90%
So very effective.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.630 align:middle line:84%
It's actually as effective
as getting your tubes tied,

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:38.150 align:middle line:90%
but it's reversible.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
used to hear everyone,

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.757 align:middle line:84%
and these horrible
things happened.

00:45:40.757 --> 00:45:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So
that's from the 1970s.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.670 align:middle line:90%
We've got to rebrand IUDs.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.168 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Here's the deal.

00:45:45.168 --> 00:45:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Can I give you one
little thing on IUDs?

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, please.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: I have a few things
that I'm a crusader around.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.110 align:middle line:84%
One's vaginal dryness,
the other's IUDs.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
women who use IUDs

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.860 align:middle line:84%
are the happiest
customers of all

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to contraceptives.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.210 align:middle line:84%
They have the highest
satisfaction rates.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I've had three and I know
what they mean by this.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It also has the
lowest rate of usage.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:15.890 align:middle line:90%
So there's a total disconnect.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Highest satisfaction,
lowest usage.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what about
any kind of problems?

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: Well, we know
that one out of three women,

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.730 align:middle line:84%
when they get a copper IUD, will
have some increased bleeding.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I had that when I had
my copper IUD put in,

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.290 align:middle line:90%
but it's manageable.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.490 align:middle line:84%
It usually resolves
within a couple of months.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And doesn't cause
any long-term kind of effects.

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.020 align:middle line:10%
>>GOTTFRIED: Doesn't
cause long-term problems.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.280 align:middle line:10%
The problem was
actually in the 1970s,

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.350 align:middle line:10%
when the Dalkon shield came out.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:44.260 align:middle line:10%
And it was like a
neon sign for bacteria

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.490 align:middle line:10%
to come up inside the uterus.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:49.040 align:middle line:10%
That particular IUD
was terrible and it

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.220 align:middle line:10%
got taken off the market.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
the negative attitude

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:84%
toward IUDs got
applied everywhere.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, yeah.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.299 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So we've got
to rebrand IUDs together.

00:46:58.299 --> 00:46:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:59.805 align:middle line:90%
So, there we go.

00:46:59.805 --> 00:47:01.982 align:middle line:84%
So that would be your
number one choice.

00:47:01.982 --> 00:47:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we'll let
people run with that.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And barriers, condoms, and--

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED:
Condoms, diaphragms.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, diaphragms.

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.363 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: I'm a big
fan of the diaphragm.

00:47:08.363 --> 00:47:09.110 align:middle line:90%
You combine that.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:12.790 align:middle line:84%
If you are, like, a fertile
myrtle, and your partner

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.370 align:middle line:84%
looks at you and
you get pregnant,

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:15.954 align:middle line:84%
then what you want
to do is combine

00:47:15.954 --> 00:47:17.870 align:middle line:84%
some of these methods
that are less effective,

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.970 align:middle line:84%
like the diaphragm, maybe
together with a condom,

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.550 align:middle line:84%
especially around the time
that you're ovulating.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Or use a little bit of
natural family planning.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Have orgasmic meditation
instead of intercourse

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:30.970 align:middle line:90%
when you're ovulation.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.009 align:middle line:84%
So I would say get creative
about how to work with this.

00:47:34.009 --> 00:47:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
women who have started

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.420 align:middle line:84%
going into this
imbalance hormonally

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and are now looking for--
Premarin's not the option.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.980 align:middle line:84%
They're now looking for
bioidentical hormones.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.717 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, they've heard

00:47:48.717 --> 00:47:52.429 align:middle line:84%
of Suzanne Somer's information
the last decade, a decade ago.

00:47:52.429 --> 00:47:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
hearing oh my god, it

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.950 align:middle line:84%
increases rates of breast
cancer, for example.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.690 align:middle line:84%
What is the truth about
bioidentical hormones?

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So the
truth about bioidenticals

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:07.340 align:middle line:84%
is actually that there's a
time and a place for them.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.830 align:middle line:84%
For women who are exquisitely
sensitive to estrogen-- when

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I have women who come to
see me in my practice,

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:16.050 align:middle line:84%
like I have a woman named
Sarah who came to see me.

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:17.880 align:middle line:90%
And she just felt flat.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:84%
54 years old, really felt like
she lost her sense of herself.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Her mojo.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Her mojo, her juju.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't feeling juicy and
on it like she used to be.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:84%
She didn't feel as at
home in her body the way

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.680 align:middle line:90%
that she used to.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And she also felt more
flat in terms of her mood.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.359 align:middle line:84%
So for her, what we
decided-- we went

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:46.400 align:middle line:84%
through what I call the
Gottfried Protocol, where

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.040 align:middle line:84%
we start off with how you eat,
move, think, and supplement.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's get cortisol
on your side again.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Not depleting you of these
really happy hormones,

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:84%
like testosterone, and
estrogen, and so forth.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we also tried
some botanical therapies.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to this
particular issue in menopause,

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:06.550 align:middle line:84%
the botanicals are
not so effective.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So with her mood
issues in particular--

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.790 align:middle line:84%
there's a subset
of women, 20 to 30%

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.915 align:middle line:84%
that I found in my practice
over the past 20 years,

00:49:14.915 --> 00:49:19.890 align:middle line:84%
who are exquisitely sensitive to
estrogen as a mood stabilizer.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you put
them on estrogen,

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:25.790 align:middle line:84%
they just overnight
feel giggly and back

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:27.250 align:middle line:90%
home in their body again.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like there is a
time and a place for hormones.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe you want
to do that work upstream first.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.450 align:middle line:84%
You want to get the
food, the supplements,

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.350 align:middle line:90%
fill in the nutritional gaps.

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.435 align:middle line:84%
Do that work first
because then your dose

00:49:41.435 --> 00:49:42.560 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a lot lower.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The meditative
practices, all of that.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Absolutely.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do the
lifestyle and food changes

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.180 align:middle line:84%
in advance as your
primary maintenance.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you're saying as an add-on
if you're a candidate for it,

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.590 align:middle line:90%
a bioidentical can be good.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:58.280 align:middle line:84%
What about the subject of
increased cancer rates?

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Breast cancer, for example.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.980 align:middle line:84%
What was that in
relationship to?

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Was that bioidenticals?

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Was that pharmaceuticals?

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:06.745 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:50:06.745 --> 00:50:07.949 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:50:07.949 --> 00:50:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So this
is the situation again

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.440 align:middle line:84%
where we want to know what
does the data show us.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have data to
answer all of these questions,

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:17.340 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.960 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that it's
probably not a good idea

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to go on external
hormones forever.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.869 align:middle line:84%
So just with what we
know about something

00:50:27.869 --> 00:50:29.535 align:middle line:84%
called hormone
resistance-- you probably

00:50:29.535 --> 00:50:30.670 align:middle line:84%
have heard of
insulin resistance.

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.001 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: You can have
hormone resistance that

00:50:33.001 --> 00:50:35.670 align:middle line:84%
develops if you're just taking
the same dose of some hormone

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:37.390 align:middle line:84%
externally once you
go through menopause.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not a big
fan of that either.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of
this middle path

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:84%
of really understanding,
OK, how can I

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:49.770 align:middle line:84%
get my neurohormonal
dashboard to support me?

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:52.910 align:middle line:84%
How could I manage it in a
way that really works for me,

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and is calibrated and
individualized for me?

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So taking this particular
issue of cancer.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.570 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
bad neighborhood.

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:06.120 align:middle line:10%
And what we know is that
the synthetic hormones

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.000 align:middle line:10%
are definitely dangerous
and provocative.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.520 align:middle line:10%
And from the Women's Health
Initiative, what we really

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.130 align:middle line:10%
believe when it comes
to breast cancer

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:16.230 align:middle line:10%
is that it's the
synthetic progestin that's

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:17.580 align:middle line:10%
the bad player.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.760 align:middle line:10%
So even the devil we
know, which is Premarin,

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.640 align:middle line:10%
it does increase
your risk of stroke,

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.810 align:middle line:10%
but it doesn't seem to have
these other ill effects,

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:29.060 align:middle line:10%
like cancer effects,
that you see

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:31.090 align:middle line:10%
from the synthetic progestin.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:35.500 align:middle line:10%
We do not have large-scale
randomized trials

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.870 align:middle line:10%
that go on for years and
years, like the Women's Health

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.420 align:middle line:10%
Initiative, for bioidenticals.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:44.580 align:middle line:84%
We have a lesser quality
study, observational studies,

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.440 align:middle line:90%
especially from Europe.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And they suggest
that there's a lower

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.470 align:middle line:84%
rate of breast cancer for
women who take bioidenticals.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But my way of looking at this
is it's a little bit more

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.670 align:middle line:90%
nuanced than that.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:52:00.070 align:middle line:84%
We want to do randomized
trials because that's

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.780 align:middle line:90%
the way that we minimize bias.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.230 align:middle line:84%
We minimize the effect of
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:05.580 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.590 align:middle line:10%
And when it comes
to bioidenticals,

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.674 align:middle line:10%
the problem here is the one size
fits all way of approaching it.

00:52:12.674 --> 00:52:14.340 align:middle line:10%
So if you do a study,
and you're looking

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.800 align:middle line:10%
at women who were on, say,
the same dose of estrodiol,

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.620 align:middle line:10%
and the same dose of
natural progesterone,

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:26.330 align:middle line:10%
some of those women have a short
serotonin transporter gene.

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:28.310 align:middle line:10%
So this is a really
interesting gene

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:33.570 align:middle line:10%
that's present in 40 to
45% of Caucasian women.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What does that
mean, functionally speaking?

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:38.080 align:middle line:10%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes, let me
break it down for you.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.510 align:middle line:10%
So this is a really
interesting gene

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:44.120 align:middle line:10%
that has a few jobs in the body.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's in charge of how
serotonin get shuttled around

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:54.370 align:middle line:84%
in between your brain
cells, your nerve cells.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It regulates how much your
genes in your brain cells

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.510 align:middle line:90%
make serotonin.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as simple
as a quantity issue.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.000 align:middle line:10%
But you move it
around a little less

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.130 align:middle line:10%
effectively if you have a
short serotonin gene, which

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:13.747 align:middle line:10%
is the mutation, versus
a long serotonin gene.

00:53:13.747 --> 00:53:15.080 align:middle line:90%
So just to back up for a minute.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.270 align:middle line:84%
When you inherit genes
from your parents,

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:22.360 align:middle line:90%
you get one copy from each.

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And two is a complete set.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.730 align:middle line:84%
The normal serotonin transporter
gene is to be long long.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:31.770 align:middle line:84%
You have a long
copy of both genes.

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:middle line:84%
You can have one copy
of the short gene

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.200 align:middle line:84%
or you can have two
copies of the short gene,

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.870 align:middle line:84%
as if you got it
from both parents.

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:40.530 align:middle line:10%
The other thing
that this gene does,

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:43.185 align:middle line:10%
besides give you problems
with communicating serotonin

00:53:43.185 --> 00:53:48.740 align:middle line:10%
in the brain, is that it makes
you go into hypervigilance more

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:52.341 align:middle line:10%
readily, especially
in perimenopause.

00:53:52.341 --> 00:53:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where it shows
that symptomatically, you're

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.340 align:middle line:90%
saying?

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: More so for
women in perimenopause,

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:01.440 align:middle line:84%
because when women have a
normal amount of estrogen,

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.330 align:middle line:84%
say up until about
age 35, 40, 45,

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:10.080 align:middle line:84%
they behave as if they've got
two copies of the normal gene.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of this work
was done in monkeys.

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.940 align:middle line:90%
We don't know as much in humans.

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Is it as simple as just giving
these women estrogen and it

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.720 align:middle line:84%
makes them feel like
they're not hypervigilant?

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.990 align:middle line:84%
But it makes your
amygdala in your brain,

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that place in your
brain where you're just

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:28.220 align:middle line:90%
surveying for danger everywhere.

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fight or flight.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.688 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Fight or flight.

00:54:29.688 --> 00:54:31.510 align:middle line:90%
It makes your amygdala hot.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:35.860 align:middle line:84%
It makes you perceive
danger everywhere you look.

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you have a
stress response all the time

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.470 align:middle line:90%
that's hard to turn off.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what percentage
of people have this short gene?

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: 40 to
45% of Caucasians,

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:49.690 align:middle line:90%
so it's very common.

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
part for this

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.884 align:middle line:84%
is that there's actually
some simple solutions.

00:54:53.884 --> 00:54:55.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I love talk about

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:58.190 align:middle line:84%
is in the Gottfried
Protocol, step one--

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:01.650 align:middle line:84%
it's this progressive way of
dealing with hormone balance.

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Step one is that you
fill in nutritional gaps.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's got a short
serotonin transporter gene

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:11.880 align:middle line:90%
needs bioactive vitamin B6.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, in
the 50 patients that I've

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.570 align:middle line:84%
treated in the past
year who have one or two

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:20.190 align:middle line:84%
copies of the short
serotonin transporter gene,

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.020 align:middle line:84%
overnight they feel
a difference when

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.610 align:middle line:84%
they get this particular
supplement, bioactive vitamin

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:26.234 align:middle line:90%
B6.

00:55:26.234 --> 00:55:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.255 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So
there's ways around it.

00:55:29.255 --> 00:55:32.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's so important
to understand that if you're

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:35.350 align:middle line:84%
feeling overwhelmed, if you're
feeling like a stress case,

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and like your
hypervigilant, you want

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.082 align:middle line:90%
to think about the biology.

00:55:39.082 --> 00:55:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Certainly there's an
emotional piece too.

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there
a test that can

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.144 align:middle line:84%
be done to determine
if you have that?

00:55:43.144 --> 00:55:43.851 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:55:43.851 --> 00:55:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple of different
ways that you can test for it.

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:50.030 align:middle line:84%
We're getting to this era where
there's more and more testing

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:52.930 align:middle line:84%
of genetics, which I
think is important to be

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.950 align:middle line:90%
a wise, informed citizen around.

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, most
conventional physicians

00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:00.660 align:middle line:84%
have no idea how to make
this information actionable.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
those places where

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:05.320 align:middle line:84%
we need to step into our
power and understand what's

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.740 align:middle line:84%
going to help us if we've
got genetic issues that

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.900 align:middle line:90%
are part of our challenge.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I want
to ask you one more

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:14.120 align:middle line:84%
thing about
replacement, and that

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.560 align:middle line:84%
is, what about
homeopathic hormones?

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: So
homeopathic remedies

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:20.620 align:middle line:90%
are really interesting.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.110 align:middle line:84%
The way that I answer a
question like that is always

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:26.244 align:middle line:84%
to go back to my inner
geek, because you know--

00:56:26.244 --> 00:56:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you are.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED:
 --Harvard-MIT-physician-scientist.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.014 align:middle line:84%
So I always go to
the data first.

00:56:30.014 --> 00:56:31.810 align:middle line:90%
What does the science tell us?

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll bring in maybe
some of my anecdotal experience

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.720 align:middle line:84%
of working with
people for 20 years,

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.130 align:middle line:90%
but I start with the hard data.

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.930 align:middle line:90%
I think hard data's super sexy.

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to this
issue of what do we do--

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some people call it
almost a whisper of hormones

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.330 align:middle line:84%
when they're talking about
homeopathic hormones.

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Right.

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
can be effective.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:58.789 align:middle line:84%
And we only have a
few minutes left,

00:56:58.789 --> 00:57:01.812 align:middle line:84%
and I want to ask you about
the testing and such too.

00:57:01.812 --> 00:57:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.920 align:middle line:10%
So when it comes
to homeopathics,

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.500 align:middle line:10%
they're proven to be
effective for certain things.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm a big fan of
homeopathic remedies,

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.260 align:middle line:10%
especially for my
children, especially

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.920 align:middle line:10%
for allergies and some of the
other inflammatory conditions

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.010 align:middle line:10%
that we face, chronic
inflammatory conditions.

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been super
impressed with some

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:25.210 align:middle line:84%
of the homeopathic remedies
from a randomized control trial

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:25.930 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, part of the
problem is we don't

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:30.310 align:middle line:84%
have a ton of money from
the government going

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:33.100 align:middle line:84%
into big randomized
trials looking

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.340 align:middle line:90%
at homeopathic remedies.

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So it may be more a matter
that we don't have the science

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.030 align:middle line:90%
to say that it's good or bad.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And so in that situation,
you have to do an experiment

00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:43.910 align:middle line:90%
and see if it works for you.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:47.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll leave it at that because
it is a more esoteric area

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.750 align:middle line:84%
anyway, not that many people
are even prescribing them.

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get into the
various modalities of testing.

00:57:55.790 --> 00:58:00.180 align:middle line:84%
We only have three minutes
left, so it's just zipped by.

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:05.732 align:middle line:84%
Mammograms or thermography,
which one would you recommend?

00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOTTFRIED: There's
no perfect screening

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.740 align:middle line:90%
test for breast cancer.

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So, given our limitations--
It's kind of like contraception,

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:12.050 align:middle line:90%
honestly.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:13.450 align:middle line:90%
We've got lousy options.

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So to me, a digital
mammogram every two

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.300 align:middle line:84%
years after the age of 50, which
is what the US Preventative

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Task Force rating
recommends, that's

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:26.280 align:middle line:84%
where I think we are
in terms of the data.

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I think the data looking
at women younger than that,

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:32.180 align:middle line:84%
it's only worthwhile
if you're high risk.

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan of thermograms.

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They detect whether you
have hormone imbalance

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:37.580 align:middle line:84%
or inflammation,
but I don't think

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.430 align:middle line:90%
they're perfect on their own.

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:40.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no perfect
screening test.

00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:42.869 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
I recommend, especially

00:58:42.869 --> 00:58:45.120 align:middle line:84%
with the new guidelines that
we have with mammograms,

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.900 align:middle line:84%
is that you get your
first mammogram,

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.620 align:middle line:90%
if you're low risk, at age 50.

00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.637 align:middle line:84%
Digital, because it's
lower in radiation.

00:58:51.637 --> 00:58:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Go to a place where they
really know what they're doing,

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:56.180 align:middle line:84%
such as UCSF, which
is a world leader.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And then to do the thermogram
every alternating year

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.580 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a screening
test that you're doing.

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you on that.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:07.279 align:middle line:90%
That's very useful information.

00:59:07.279 --> 00:59:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look about
the other tests.

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.280 align:middle line:84%
If we want to do a profile--
we have just a couple minutes

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:14.550 align:middle line:84%
left-- do we do the saliva
tests, hair tests, blood tests?

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:15.686 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:59:15.686 --> 00:59:17.810 align:middle line:10%
>>GOTTFRIED: I typically
start with the blood tests

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:20.390 align:middle line:10%
because it's the language
of conventional physicians.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:23.500 align:middle line:10%
And I really want to
bridge together this divide

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.280 align:middle line:10%
that we have between
conventional medicine

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.790 align:middle line:10%
and alternative medicine.

00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So I am a big fan
of blood testing.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The problem is it's a
snapshot of the six seconds

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.199 align:middle line:90%
that a needle's in your vein.

00:59:34.199 --> 00:59:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good
place to start if you

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:38.487 align:middle line:84%
want to look at your cortisol,
your DHEA, the balance

00:59:38.487 --> 00:59:40.070 align:middle line:84%
between your estrogen
and progesterone

00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and your androgens, it's
a good place to start.

00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:47.190 align:middle line:84%
If you find that you have
a problem with cortisol,

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:49.940 align:middle line:84%
like I did when I measured
my blood in my 30s,

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.860 align:middle line:84%
then you want to actually
do some more nuanced tests.

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I think
saliva testing can be helpful.

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's pluses and minuses
of each form of testing.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The other problem is this
issue of hormone resistance.

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to the woman
with the short serotonin

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.930 align:middle line:84%
transporter gene,
for instance, she

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:11.590 align:middle line:84%
develops cortisol
resistance, where

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:14.110 align:middle line:84%
the level that you measure
of cortisol in her blood

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.870 align:middle line:84%
does not necessarily
reflect what's

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:17.580 align:middle line:90%
happening inside her cells.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the testing is
less helpful than asking

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.967 align:middle line:84%
her questions about
her experience.

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So actually spending
time with your patients, again.

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Yes, exactly.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gee, what
a novel theory.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Oh my gosh.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you do that.

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:29.850 align:middle line:90%
You do that in spades.

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
you've taken the time

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to document all this in this
book for the rest of us.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.035 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say
you've done a lovely job.

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You can see yourself in it, no
matter who's reading this book.

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
You can see, and your own
symptomatology in the book,

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:46.200 align:middle line:90%
and what you can do about that.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
say we're out of time.

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a
lovely conversation.

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for writing
this book for the rest of us

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.849 align:middle line:84%
and making this
information available.

01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GOTTFRIED: Thank you, Regina.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.490 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure and honor.

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're feeling
wigged out, angry at the kids,

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
fat, and not at all
sexual, I highly

01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:08.350 align:middle line:84%
recommend picking up a
copy of "The Hormone Cure."

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It's worth it for
the appendix alone,

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
with a description of all the
foods and supplements that

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
can help you, and
a brief description

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:16.400 align:middle line:90%
of the role of each hormone.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's to say nothing of the
healing protocols themselves.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Good stuff.

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
