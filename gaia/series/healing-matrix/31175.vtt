[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
One subject that

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:84%
continues to mystify
we human beings is sex.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:10%
It can be the most sublime
or the most conflicted area

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:10%
of life.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:10%
In my last conversation
with Ellen Eatough, who

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:10%
is termed the soulful sex
coach, we spoke of the reasons

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:10%
we hide behind masks,
withhold and refuse

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:10%
to trust when it comes
to our sex lives.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Today we discussed some
profound new technologies

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:84%
for helping us ease into our
true selves while making love,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's really what
it's all about, isn't it?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.885 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLEN EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Easing
into our true selves

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.717 align:middle line:84%
which is-- that's a
journey in itself.

00:01:06.717 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Forget the sex part.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.603 align:middle line:90%
That's just a journey.

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:08.794 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Right.

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a life
journey right there.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
I'd like to do first

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:84%
off for whoever may not have
seen our first conversation

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and even for those returning
to this conversation

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
from that one, is give
us a little synopsis

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
of what we spoke about by way
of kind of the sacred wound

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.856 align:middle line:84%
and what we're coming
out of as a species.

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go
into what we're

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking about
in this conversation.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: OK.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.854 align:middle line:10%
Well basically,
I feel that there

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:10%
is a widespread cultural
split, religious split,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:10%
personal split, family
split between sexuality

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:10%
and spirituality.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:10%
And so many people as they're
growing personally and evolving

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:10%
and trying to become
more spiritually aware,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:10%
are feeling this
split so profoundly,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:10%
and that's a conflict
for a lot of people.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
It becomes an energetic
split, a psychological split,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:90%
emotional split.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether we like it or not, we
often have to deal with it.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we talked about my
definition of ecstatic love

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
making, which is
really an integrated

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
experience of intense
physical, sexual pleasure

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
with deep emotional intimacy
and spiritual union.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we also
spoke about the whole

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:84%
putting the spiritual
completely above the physical

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
as though that is a
low-- to be in a body

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.592 align:middle line:90%
is a very lowered status.

00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:26.258 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
That's where this
split comes from.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.498 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Eastern
religions, often

00:02:29.498 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
from the whole
inheritance we have

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.080 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek philosophers
where they separated

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:84%
the psyche, the
mental-spiritual as being better

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
than the soma, which was the
feminine side of lives, which

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
included sexuality,
and childbirth,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
side of life, what

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:84%
we might call the
messy side of life.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of misogyny and it--

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:84%
it's perpetuated so deeply
and fully in our culture

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.972 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
feel like they can either

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
be sexual or spiritual,
but they can't be both.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Not at
the same time anyway.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And it is interesting because
we talked about one instance.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It was about one of your clients
who had had a pain in her body

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't
diagnosis, a chronic pain.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
it'd really come

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
from this collective
experience from past lives

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
even into this
lifetime, this timeline.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
looking at something

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that is so distant,
and so pervasive,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and such a part of--
really it's almost

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
part of our electrical
DNA, these feelings,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:84%
these experiences,
of ourselves, you're

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
talking about a fair amount
of rewiring that has to go on.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Especially
when we've got

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
stuff that's locked in the
body physically and symptoms,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.085 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, which have
other kinds of symptoms.

00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:50.585 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:52.376 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it really
start shutting down

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
the flow of energy.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
that quite a bit.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about what you're

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be sharing with
us in this conversation

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
before we start getting
into the particulars.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah,
well, I think we

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.595 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about
transcendent sex, the research

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I've participated in on
that topic, how that led me

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, and these
four keys to sexual ecstasy

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and how that ended up
not just being a way

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to help open people to
transcendent lovemaking

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
by the research definition,
but what ended up

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:84%
being something
that helped people

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.307 align:middle line:84%
have the best sex
of their lives.

00:04:27.307 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And just whatever
their own standard was.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to that
part of the conversation.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.563 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And about really
resistance to pleasure

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and how we can expand
our capacity for pleasure

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.165 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:04:38.165 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.771 align:middle line:84%
And let's go back
for just a moment.

00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: We also too, we want
to talk about sex and aging.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.413 align:middle line:84%
We want to talk about
sex as we age as well.

00:04:46.413 --> 00:04:49.171 align:middle line:84%
And we talked a bit about-- you
were just mentioning the fact

00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that a couple
thousand years ago, we

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
went into the era of the mind
where the mind was elevated

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
over the emotions and over
even in the Greek philosophers,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:84%
they were bringing
in spirit into mind,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:84%
but down into the
emotions and the physical.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:90%
That's where that cut off came.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But you also work
with technologies

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that help us access brain
states that are fundamentally

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.827 align:middle line:84%
healthy and friendly to the
process of letting our masks go

00:05:15.827 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and making love, and we're going
to talk about that technology

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Right.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.716 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a combination
of brain wave entrainment

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:90%
and subtle energies.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.799 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And subtle energies.

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Like color,
sound, energetic frequencies,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:90%
resonant frequencies.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A subject that I'm
absolutely fascinated with.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's talk
about Jenny Wade's research

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and how you-- I mean you
were a hypnotherapist.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
You also had your master's
in east-west psychology.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
How did you stumble
into Jenny Wade's world?

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.465 align:middle line:90%
Who is Jenny Wade?

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about her.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Jenny
Wade is a professor

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.465 align:middle line:84%
at the Institute for
Transpersonal Psychology

00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:90%
in Menlo Park, California.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:84%
She's a consciousness
researcher,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and she wrote a book on
consciousness development.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And through her own
personal experience,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
she started research on what
she called transcendent sex.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had been working
for a number of years

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
helping people release
physical and relationship

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.074 align:middle line:84%
and sexual trauma or
wounding of whatever level

00:06:11.074 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
using the color that I
projected into the eyes

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and other energetic tools.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I started having
my own what I found

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
were called transcendent
sexual experiences

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and actually it was my last
semester in grad school getting

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.185 align:middle line:84%
my master's when
I heard her speak.

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a class on
transpersonal perspectives

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:90%
on sexuality and relationship.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And she started describing
these case studies

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
where people were having these
totally-altered experiences

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.299 align:middle line:84%
during lovemaking, and
I'm going, oh, my god.

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not the only
ones, because this

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
is kind of where
I had found myself

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.596 align:middle line:84%
through the previous couple
of years and wondering like,

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:90%
are we the only ones?

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.650 align:middle line:90%
It turns out no, thankfully.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.887 align:middle line:84%
And her definition was a little
different than my definition

00:06:55.887 --> 00:06:56.845 align:middle line:90%
of ecstatic lovemaking.

00:06:56.845 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But her definition
of transcendent sex

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
is first without any particular
intention like tantra practice

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
or psychotropic
drugs or anything.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
People spontaneously
found themselves

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
in a sort of altered
state, what she defined

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:84%
as a change of agency-like
perception of who you are.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.386 align:middle line:84%
Like you might perceive
yourself to be someone else,

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:84%
or something else, something
in nature, or animals,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and/or
a change of time.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.335 align:middle line:84%
Like one couple found themselves
being in a past life together,

00:07:29.335 --> 00:07:32.032 align:middle line:84%
and they could all describe the
physicality of the environment

00:07:32.032 --> 00:07:34.115 align:middle line:84%
and the clothes they were
wearing, and everything.

00:07:34.115 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a simultaneous
past-life experience,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
or finding themselves in some
Greek culture or whatever,

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:84%
or a shift in time or place,
so time, place, or agency.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And that was her definition.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.342 align:middle line:84%
And she said, if anybody had
any experiences in this realm

00:07:51.342 --> 00:07:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to talk with
you, and I ended up

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
becoming a research
subject in her study.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And then next thing I knew when
her book was being published

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:84%
under a subsidiary of
Simon and Schuster,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:84%
she called me because she
knew that I was trying to-- I

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:90%
had a website.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to share what
this whole thing on ecstatic

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:90%
love making with people.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.082 align:middle line:84%
So she said, they're willing
to do workshops on sex,

00:08:12.082 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a consciousness
researcher.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:90%
So let's do something together.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up each doing sort
of complementary workshops.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.336 align:middle line:84%
Hers academic, mine experiential
on transcendent sex.

00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
This is at the
International Conference

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
on Sacred Sexuality in
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to,
at some point, go back

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
to what you mentioned,
which was like you said,

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
not on psychotropic drugs
and specific practices

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:90%
such as tantra.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that in a little bit

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
because I want to talk
about what you feel

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and what you've seen in people
that have actually utilized

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:84%
these other aids, so to speak,
to reach a certain point.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's talk about
what you ended up developing

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:84%
from there, which is the
four keys to sexual ecstasy,

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and spend some time
talking to us about that.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.410 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: So, first
of all, I thought

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:10%
I was creating a program
for this conference,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:10%
a workshop on how to open
yourself to transcendent sex.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.059 align:middle line:84%
And by her definition,
I was trying

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
to help people open
themselves, which

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:90%
I believe is a state of grace.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.836 align:middle line:84%
You can't force it, but I
feel you can open yourself

00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:24.684 align:middle line:84%
to it, to some of
these altered states.

00:09:24.684 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
set an intention

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.334 align:middle line:90%
that you are open to it even.

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, what
is it helps do that?

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.246 align:middle line:84%
So I spent pretty much
a number of months.

00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I'd been researching all
of this for quite a while,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
because I was really
trying to say, OK.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
How do we help
people open to this?

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with
these four keys,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and I took people through
some experiential exercises.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were not
sexual in nature.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I gave some sexual
information, but the exercises

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
were taking people into
a state of intimacy,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'll describe
these four keys.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But the cool thing that was
totally unexpected for me

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
was, that after this half-day
workshop, the next morning as I

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
was trying to get to the
bottom to the next lecture

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
at this hotel in the
conference, people

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:84%
were like beating a path to my
door to give me hugs and thank

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.789 align:middle line:84%
me for the best
sex of their lives.

00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:15.079 align:middle line:84%
The people that were couples--
because the workshop had

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:16.746 align:middle line:84%
170 people and
probably half of them

00:10:16.746 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
were couples-- people
were oh, my god.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
They weren't having
altered state experiences.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
They were just having the
best most deeply-connected,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.372 align:middle line:84%
most sexually-exciting,
most spiritually-connected--

00:10:27.372 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which
is a huge step up

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:84%
from where most people
are day in and day out.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Right.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:31.875 align:middle line:90%
So I went, oh, my god.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I've got something here.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:33.826 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do
something with this.

00:10:33.826 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I ended up
creating a product that people

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.015 align:middle line:84%
could use in the privacy
of their own homes.

00:10:37.015 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.573 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about it.

00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the four keys.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.289 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: OK.

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to
know what they are?

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.633 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: OK.

00:10:42.633 --> 00:10:45.945 align:middle line:84%
The first key, and we've
talked about this, is trust.

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:90%
It is so important.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Trust is, in particular
the kind of sexual trust

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.040 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about last time,
is really related to freedom.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I think in life in
general, trust and freedom

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:90%
go hand in hand.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
You can't have one
without the other.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.546 align:middle line:84%
If you have more freedom,
you have more trust.

00:11:07.546 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
If you have more
trust, it naturally

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:90%
leads to more freedom.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
freedom is like freedom

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to express
yourself fully,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
freedom to be able to ask
for what you want and need,

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
freedom to be able to
maybe make weird sounds,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
or weird facial
expressions, or to not

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.899 align:middle line:84%
have to control yourself
during love making.

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You self image.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
For fear of being
judged, or thought

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:84%
weird, or the neighbors hearing
the noises, or whatever.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.135 align:middle line:90%
So that trust is so important.

00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:41.976 align:middle line:90%
And now it just occurred to me.

00:11:41.976 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:84%
There is, in fact, a little
tip for your listeners.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.135 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And this one
comes from Louann Brizendine.

00:11:47.135 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:84%
She wrote two books, one
called "The Female Brain,"

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.700 align:middle line:84%
the other called
"The Male Brain."

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And in "The Female Brain,"
through her research,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
she noticed that women,
their trust levels

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:02.812 align:middle line:84%
go up when you have like a
full-body, 20-second hug.

00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Margot Anand
talks about that as well.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Starting the day with
that full-body hug.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.256 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:12:08.256 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So my prescription to
keep the juices flowing

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship is, every
day to have that 20-second--

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:90%
and you can be fully clothed.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.465 align:middle line:84%
But a full embrace for 20
seconds where you really

00:12:19.465 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:84%
can feel each
other's heart beat,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, followed
by a 10-second kiss.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you can add
another 30 seconds to each

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
say some expression of
appreciation for each other,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:84%
but something
different each day.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.324 align:middle line:84%
Like, I just really love when
we have eye contact that I just

00:12:36.324 --> 00:12:37.865 align:middle line:84%
feel like you're so
beautifully there

00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
or something, whatever it is,
each day to find something

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate them.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That one minute--

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: That takes
a total of 60 seconds.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:90%
And if we can't do that--

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not too
committed to the process.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --not too committed
to the relationship, yeah.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.009 align:middle line:90%
But trust is the first key.

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
talk about the man's

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:90%
brain and trust.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:90%
What creates trust for the man?

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: To be honest, I'm
not clear on that one yet.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you were saying
she wrote those two books.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I haven't
gotten to the second book.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.315 align:middle line:90%
I bought the second book.

00:13:04.315 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:90%
I haven't finished reading it.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So for the woman, that is what's
required to create that trust?

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But also
trust creates oxytocin.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.315 align:middle line:84%
It creates the bonding
for both partners.

00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:12.394 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brain chemical.

00:13:12.394 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.206 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:13.206 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --which is
the nurturing hormone.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.753 align:middle line:90%
That's a great little tip.

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.314 align:middle line:84%
And any more on trust, or
should we go on to the next key?

00:13:20.314 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.146 align:middle line:90%
I think we can go into that.

00:13:22.146 --> 00:13:23.902 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go
into entrainment.

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:27.115 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Entrainment
is the-- it's

00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
a natural phenomenon
on the planet where

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:84%
the rhythms of any
object will affect

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:84%
the rhythms of other
objects with beats

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:90%
that aren't as strong.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of--
as far as I know,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
the original understanding of
this happened in Switzerland.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
This guy put like dozens
of pendulum clocks

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:84%
on the wall-- in a
factory or something--

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.289 align:middle line:84%
and of course, when you
set pendulum clocks,

00:13:58.289 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
they're all going to be
tick-tocking chaotically;

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
you can't set them at the
same microsecond, right?

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Leave them alone for
two or three days,

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and they will all
be tick-tocking

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.005 align:middle line:90%
in perfect synchrony.

00:14:09.005 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:90%
These are inanimate objects.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're moving, but--
they're coming in synchronous.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.412 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's something
about the field that

00:14:15.412 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:90%
allows for entrainment.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.911 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And many people are
familiar with situations where

00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:84%
women who live in
community, like in college

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
dorms or spiritual communities
with her menstrual cycles

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:90%
will start to synchronize.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And fireflies will start to--
even when they start to swarm,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
their blinking will
start to synchronize,

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.260 align:middle line:84%
so it';s just a
natural phenomenon.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So at any given time,
we have a number

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.884 align:middle line:84%
of different brain waves
cycling in our brain.

00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Different parts of
our brain, typically,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.865 align:middle line:84%
are cycling at somewhat
different speeds,

00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
but there's usually
a predominant brain

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:90%
wave happening.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.135 align:middle line:84%
So when we're trying
to figure things out,

00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:53.720 align:middle line:84%
or when we're trying to follow
a recipe, or write a report,

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
or balance our
checkbook, we're in beta.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's cognitive
processing kind of state.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:84%
A little bit slower
is alpha, which

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:90%
is sort of a meditative state.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a receptive state.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a time when we're
often receptive listening

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
to a lecture, often watching
television, or driving

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:84%
on the open road, and you start
to get all these great ideas

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.914 align:middle line:90%
and make connections.

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
That's because the
peripheral vision passing by

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.190 align:middle line:84%
causes you to go
into an alpha state.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a rhythm
in your environment,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a clicking sound
or music that has brain wave

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
entrainment in it, it can help
your brain slow down from beta

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
down into an alpha state
or slow down even further

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
into a theta brain wave
state, which is slower.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's a state when we're
typically asleep and dreaming.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:90%
It has high visual imagery.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It's what I often use in
my private practice helping

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.730 align:middle line:90%
people access more information--

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.605 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The memory.

00:15:50.605 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --to get to the
root of issues and shift them.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's what people often are
taken into via hypnosis

00:15:59.040 --> 00:15:59.970 align:middle line:90%
into alpha or theta.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a very deep
meditative state.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
If people are
accomplished meditators,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:90%
they might go that deep.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And it just happens
to be researched

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to be the ideal
state for lovemaking

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
because in theta, when we have
a predominantly theta brainwave

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:84%
patterns, we have heightened
sensory perceptions,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
so we're more aware
of our pleasure.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:84%
We are more aware of our
own emotional states.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:84%
We have more of a
holistic awareness

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
of our partner and their needs
and their emotional state

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and ours, and it just
helps us tap into that.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one brainwave
research expert,

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jeffrey Thompson has put out
lots of brainwave entrainment

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:90%
products, music products.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
He very emphatically
says that theta

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:84%
is the ideal state for
great sex and talked

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:84%
about creating an
orgasmatron or something.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's definitely
the place to go.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.925 align:middle line:84%
But in this workshop,
when I was first

00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
presenting these four
keys to sexual ecstasy,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
during one of these intimacy
exercises that I was guiding

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:84%
people into, I put on a little
piece of Jeffrey Thompson's

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:84%
music, but the only
piece that seemed

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:84%
ideal for the situation
that had some rhythm to it

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.005 align:middle line:84%
because I was asking people
to move, it was pretty short.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:90%
It was about three minutes long.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.891 align:middle line:90%
It was classical music.

00:17:19.891 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
And after people were
sharing their experiences

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and had these amazing
experiences and Jenny Wade

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:84%
happened to walk in during
part of this, and she was,

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
oh, my god.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.316 align:middle line:90%
People were falling in love.

00:17:27.316 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:90%
What was happening?

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I then
confessed to people

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that I was using brain
wave entrainment,

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and I was explaining that.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And they all wanted the music,
so that planted my seed.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But entrainment can
happen in other ways.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
In tantra, they teach you
to try to breathe together

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
because our bodies
will naturally

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
entrain within our own
biological systems.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So you know that when you
slow your breathing down,

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:84%
your heart rate will
slow down, which

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:84%
will help your
brain to slow down,

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
which helps you go into
deeper meditative states.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So the ancients knew
this intuitively.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Also the eyes are like
the windows to the soul,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and they're actually like the
frontal lobes of the brain.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you have soft,
gazing eye contact

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:84%
into another person's
eyes, you will

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
start to make not only
an energetic connection,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
a soulful connection,
but you'll start

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
to make a connection
like brainwave wise.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And they've hooked
people up to electrodes

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.475 align:middle line:84%
to track their brainwaves
during conversation.

00:18:30.475 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
They find that when
people non-sexually

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're have a
deeply-connected conversation

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
that their brainwaves are
starting to synchronize.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:39.335 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: So if you can have
an external stimulus that

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
helps your brainwaves slow
down, it affects both partners.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.760 align:middle line:84%
It helps both partners to
feel very connected or in sync

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
because they're synchronizing
all of their body systems,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.755 align:middle line:84%
start to get closer
into a similar rhythm--

00:18:57.755 --> 00:18:58.349 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:18:58.349 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --and it makes
you feel deeply connected

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.696 align:middle line:90%
with the other person.

00:19:01.696 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And they've done also
brainwave experiments

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
with people who are
in separate locations,

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
where you send the feeling
of love or appreciation.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember Patrick
Flanagan years

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
go telling me that he and
his wife Stephanie had been

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
monitored through I think it
was maybe part of the HeartMath

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Institute, doing this
particular experiment

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:90%
and monitoring their EKG.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was the
sender of the love.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.442 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, she was
just having conversations

00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:84%
with other people,
didn't know when

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:90%
he was going to be sending.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:90%
They were just separated.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was, as she was just

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of going on
with their life,

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
slowly, his intention
and feeling of love

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:84%
started bringing her heart
rhythms and his together.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.182 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:19:50.182 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Much
more advanced work.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More advanced
work, but very simple work,

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
very profound, I
mean, because even

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
if you have one
partner who really

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.464 align:middle line:84%
is able to hold that love
and project that feeling,

00:20:02.464 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:90%
that's really important too.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
One person, you
don't have to have--

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --both people
with clear intention.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:90%
One will do.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Because the one
with the stronger frequency,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.384 align:middle line:84%
it's just like if you
turn your dial on a radio

00:20:12.384 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening
to a program,

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and you drive along and there's
another frequency that's coming

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.265 align:middle line:84%
in stronger, it will start
to interfere take over--

00:20:18.265 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: --that channel.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the one with
the stronger frequency

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.231 align:middle line:84%
can help influence
the other and bring--

00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:25.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:25.105 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: --synchronization.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's really a
profound key to ecstatic

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
lovemaking, because
when you feel

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.725 align:middle line:84%
that non-verbal connection,
it's very powerful.

00:20:36.725 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And it
feels very intimate.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's
talk about-- that

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.515 align:middle line:84%
leads to the next key
which is absorption.

00:20:42.515 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:10%
Now, this one was-- we
kind of all know this,

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.725 align:middle line:10%
like when you really tune
into your sensory perception,

00:20:49.725 --> 00:20:52.165 align:middle line:10%
you know, you can feel more.

00:20:52.165 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:10%
But there's actually
some research done

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:10%
on this by a Dr.
Sandra Scantling,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and she wrote a book
which is out of print now,

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's called "Ordinary
Women, Extraordinary Sex."

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.435 align:middle line:84%
And she talked about
super sexual experiences

00:21:04.435 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and was trying to
figure out what

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.664 align:middle line:84%
it is that makes
the people that have

00:21:07.664 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
these experiences
different than others,

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.538 align:middle line:84%
and it was mostly women that
she wasn't working with.

00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And her intuition
was that the women

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
that she'd had in
her research that

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:84%
had these great
experiences might

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
be kind of responding more
than the average person

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:90%
to a measurable trait.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was a thing called
the Tellegen Absorption Scale.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.777 align:middle line:84%
It's one of a group of
psychological tools,

00:21:34.777 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:84%
like an assessment tool
that's used in psychology.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And so she took
a section of this

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:45.815 align:middle line:84%
to analyze people's ability to
really tune into-- and absorb

00:21:45.815 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
is the word she used-- absorb
into their sensory experience

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
with their minds, their
being, their awareness

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
to absorb literally
into their senses.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, although
this is an aptitude,

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.869 align:middle line:90%
it's a natural aptitude.

00:22:03.869 --> 00:22:06.035 align:middle line:84%
Some people just do this
naturally more than others,

00:22:06.035 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%
but we can learn to do it more.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's good,
because our culture really

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.205 align:middle line:90%
prizes beta functioning.

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Keep
going, going, going.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Work extra hours in the office.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Figure it out.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Figure it out.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:84%
A type personalities
are exalted.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And I'm
guilty of that.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Probably the worst.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.706 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:21.706 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're trying
to calm down and relax

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you
decided you're going

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to be intimate with your mate,
the beta brain is still going.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The laundry list is
still going, which

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.117 align:middle line:84%
is like the absolute
mortal enemy--

00:22:34.117 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Especially for women.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I have to say men are
much more adept at kind

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
of moving from their
head to their pelvis

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:90%
when theY get ready for sex.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.601 align:middle line:84%
Women have a much more difficult
time making that transition.

00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, aside
from being able to have access

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to some of the technologies,
do you have some little trick

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.657 align:middle line:84%
or two for women to start
getting out of the head, just

00:22:56.657 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:84%
a trigger point so we can
start getting out of the head.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:84%
One is, you know, your partner
can help you with this,

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.961 align:middle line:90%
but women can start themselves.

00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
If you know that sex is
on the menu for evening

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.890 align:middle line:84%
or in the morning,
or whatever it is,

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:84%
you can do things to
start your transition.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
you're commuting home,

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
anything like spraying
on a little cologne,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:84%
putting lotion on
your hands, anything

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.110 align:middle line:84%
that starts to trigger
your own sensory awareness.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Taking a bubble bath,
just meditating for a bit

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to get out of the beta brain,
get your brainwaves slowed down

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:84%
because that will help you get
into that sensory awareness.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.695 align:middle line:84%
So just anything
that will help you--

00:23:34.695 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anything that
will put you into the body.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --tune
into your body.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And so anything more
on the absorption part?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.225 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, yeah because
if you have a partner,

00:23:44.225 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
you want to train
your partner, and that

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.140 align:middle line:84%
is to help women to get out of
their head and into their body.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.329 align:middle line:84%
A lot of men, because
what they often like

00:23:53.329 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a direct hit
to the genitals to get it

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
turned on, which is
great to do for your guy.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
that for women,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:84%
if you do a direct hit to
the genitals or the breasts,

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.899 align:middle line:90%
it's fun in a playful way.

00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It's fun to kind of
keep the juices flowing

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.812 align:middle line:84%
throughout the week, but when
you're getting ready for sex,

00:24:09.812 --> 00:24:11.186 align:middle line:84%
men don't realize
and women often

00:24:11.186 --> 00:24:13.730 align:middle line:84%
don't either that we
kind of subconsciously,

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.050 align:middle line:90%
unconsciously contract at that.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.612 align:middle line:84%
Even though we want it, it's
like if it comes too soon--

00:24:19.612 --> 00:24:19.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
what's up with that?

00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:22.416 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --and then it's like
a hurdle we have to get past,

00:24:22.416 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's because we haven't
had time to warm up.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So the man knows this, to help
a woman get out of her head

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:90%
because she's not there.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:90%
She's not into her body yet.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's too big a leap.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So starting with
the extremities,

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
foot massage, holding hands,
kiss on the back of the neck

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:84%
while she's at the computer
in the kitchen, that

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:84%
will kind of send
shivers down any woman

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and get her into
her body, typically.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Kissing, eye contact,
touching-- holding

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:55.070 align:middle line:84%
the face, that will help
get her out of her head

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.470 align:middle line:90%
and into her body.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Words of affection
and love will start

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
to help her move
down into her heart.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And see, for women
are like water,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:90%
so men are more like fire.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, women are like water,
and so our energy flows down,

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.931 align:middle line:84%
and so we got to flow it out
of the head, into the heart,

00:25:13.931 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:90%
and down.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And so once your
heart starts to open

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're tuned into your
awareness of your body,

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:84%
then your energy flows
down to your pelvis

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.230 align:middle line:90%
and your legs wanna open.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Till then, it's really hard.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:24.830 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I hear a lot of women though, a
lot of women talk about-- yeah.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
He just kind of goes right for
it, and everything contracts.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And just like you said contracts

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.692 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: You can't help it.

00:25:32.692 --> 00:25:34.166 align:middle line:84%
Even if you really
want to have sex--

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.023 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --it just
becomes a hurdle,

00:25:36.023 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:90%
then you have to get past.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But women, once we're really
getting into our sexuality--

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.780 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about
before-- often

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:84%
have a much more easy time
having full-body orgasms

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
or feeling our sexuality
throughout our bodies.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize that this is
not as natural for most men.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it
natural for most women

00:25:56.685 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
to have whole-body-- talk about
what a whole-body orgasm is,

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and is that natural
for most women.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:02.977 align:middle line:90%
Is it common?

00:26:02.977 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, the physiological
orgasm is--

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.934 align:middle line:84%
it's the contraction of
the pubococcygeal muscles.

00:26:07.934 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: OK.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's also an
energetic experience.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.252 align:middle line:84%
And so women will often
feel their orgasms just

00:26:15.252 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
like an energetic experience
throughout their bodies.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.270 align:middle line:84%
It might be tingling, and
relaxation, or it might be,

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's--

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's convulsing.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Different
for a lot of women.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:90%
It can be convulsing.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It can be-- it's like a sense
of light and color or firework.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's very different
for so many women,

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.890 align:middle line:84%
but men can have just
as powerful orgasms,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:84%
but they often don't feel
it beyond their genitals

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.710 align:middle line:90%
or their pelvic area.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And so while you're
making love with a man,

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.182 align:middle line:84%
you could actually
help spread his energy.

00:26:42.182 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do you do that?

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: By starting
more with the genitals

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and then either caressing
him, or even just sort

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:84%
of like sweeping his
energy a half inch

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.700 align:middle line:84%
or inch off his skin just like
you're caressing the energy,

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and like going around to his
buttocks and down his legs

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and up his torso, up
his chest, or whatever

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
you can reach in the position
you're in, up his back,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:84%
up his chest, around his
neck, and down his arms.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And this will gradually
help him start

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:84%
the energy-- him to become
aware of his senses.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's moving the field.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.346 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:27:14.346 --> 00:27:17.414 align:middle line:84%
And it helps him to become
more aware of his body.

00:27:17.414 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can that happen,
you say just above the body

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.289 align:middle line:84%
or how about just
very light touch?

00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.954 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Both.

00:27:21.954 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to be
just-- it could also be firm.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.320 align:middle line:90%
It can be massaging depending.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're in a really
sort of tense-- you know,

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:84%
intense period, and so
it might be even subtle

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:84%
scratching or hard
massaging, because men often

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
like stronger touch than women
do, just evolutionary wise.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So then he's more aware of
his whole body, so by the time

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.200 align:middle line:84%
he has an orgasm,
he's able to feel it

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.200 align:middle line:84%
more throughout his body,
and the energy spreads

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:90%
more rapidly.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's a win-win.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So a woman could approach
her partner saying,

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I've learned
something that I can

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:84%
help you spread your energy
throughout your body,

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's just the
opposite of what I need.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
know what I need

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:84%
to get hotter and
juicier for you faster?

00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.518 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:59.518 --> 00:28:00.726 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Give him the goal.

00:28:00.726 --> 00:28:00.772 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:00.772 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have the angle.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: The goal is for
you get turned on faster,

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.020 align:middle line:84%
then tell him that you
need to warm up, and bring

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:05.931 align:middle line:90%
that energy in.

00:28:05.931 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Men are like fire.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Their energy moves
up, and this is also

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.241 align:middle line:84%
why you know you hear that
women need sex to feel love.

00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Women need love to
feel sex and men--

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:90%
It seems like a stereotype.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:90%
And men need sex to feel love.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's true for
a lot of people,

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's why men often
connect most deeply

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:84%
with their partner
during sexual lovemaking

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:84%
because their energy is like
firing from their pelvis--

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:90%
when their energy isn't blocked.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:84%
When they're not just in it
for the sexual gratification,

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:84%
but when they do love their
partner, as that energy moves

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:84%
up to their heart, it's
when they can most fully

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.910 align:middle line:84%
feel their love for their
partner as that sexual energy

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:90%
intensifies.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's that
reverse polarity thing where

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:84%
the woman's energy has to
come out and the men's-- yes.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.635 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Like
water moving down,

00:28:50.635 --> 00:28:52.250 align:middle line:84%
the men's energy is
like fire moving up.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.766 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I learned this from
Taoist sexuality.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.755 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ancients
knew so much.

00:28:57.755 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The tao of sexuality,
very interesting.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.607 align:middle line:84%
Then you go from absorption to
building sexual energy, which

00:29:05.607 --> 00:29:06.315 align:middle line:90%
it sounds to me--

00:29:06.315 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Building
and circulating.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and circulating.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And
that's part of that.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
part of that.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
that people often, they

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
get to a point of
intensity and then it

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.430 align:middle line:84%
gets to a point of almost,
well, you either get going

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and you just want
to have that orgasm,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.050 align:middle line:84%
or it gets almost to
a point of discomfort

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
where you either have to
push forward to climax

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and have the release or back
off because it's too much.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:35.915 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Blowing the circuits.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And so building
sexual energy we could

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
talk about expanding
our capacity

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.017 align:middle line:90%
for more and more pleasure.

00:29:47.017 --> 00:29:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the kind of things
I was talking about in terms

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:84%
of moving sexual energy
just a moment ago,

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:84%
masculine and feminine,
and clearing out

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.470 align:middle line:84%
the blocks to the
energy that really

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:90%
wants to flow up and around.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:04.390 align:middle line:84%
When energy gets
more intense, when

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.715 align:middle line:84%
we can handle more energy
without dissipating

00:30:06.715 --> 00:30:10.840 align:middle line:84%
it or backing off from it,
and we can circulate it.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's just like--

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:12.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's ecstatic sex.

00:30:12.795 --> 00:30:14.295 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: --that's
like giving fuel

00:30:14.295 --> 00:30:17.622 align:middle line:84%
for a rocket to blast off
into the stratosphere.

00:30:17.622 --> 00:30:22.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But instead, we
often try to resist pleasure.

00:30:22.025 --> 00:30:24.544 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: We rarely
try to resist it.

00:30:24.544 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:90%
We resist.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.935 align:middle line:84%
Why do we as a species
resist pleasure?

00:30:30.935 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I don't know if I
know the answer to the why.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Animals don't do that.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: No.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it can be because of
culture, cultural restrictions

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:90%
like, oh.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Too much pleasure is bad.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:84%
If I feel too much
pleasure, I might

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:84%
lose control and then
what would happen?

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I might get judged.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.185 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll do
something really weird.

00:30:50.185 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that will be.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's just
too hedonistic.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We judge ourselves,
or it actually

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:90%
does become too intense.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like it can become
almost uncomfortable

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.595 align:middle line:84%
because the pleasure
can become too intense.

00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:10.182 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that a
fear of losing control?

00:31:10.182 --> 00:31:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Maybe,
but I think it also

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:84%
is because we just haven't
learned to get comfortable.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --learned what to
do with that amount of energy.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: We just haven't
learned to get comfortable

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.660 align:middle line:90%
with that amount of pleasure.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:23.225 align:middle line:84%
It's like we just haven't
quite felt that much

00:31:23.225 --> 00:31:26.030 align:middle line:90%
and still been OK.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So-- but we can
expand our capacity

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.052 align:middle line:90%
to experience more pressure.

00:31:32.052 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:90%
You want a quick tip on that?

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:33.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:33.843 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, one is if
you liken our sexual pleasure

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.295 align:middle line:84%
energy system to
like a balloon, you

00:31:39.295 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
know the first time
you blow up a balloon,

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:84%
a brand new balloon, it's
kind of hard to blow up.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:84%
You try to blow it up and
gets to a certain size.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.855 align:middle line:84%
But have you ever noticed if
you let the air out and then

00:31:48.855 --> 00:31:51.110 align:middle line:84%
blow it up again,
it's easier to blow

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:55.880 align:middle line:84%
farther because that membrane
has become more flexible.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.079 align:middle line:84%
So you could do this with
your own sexual energy.

00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And one way to do this, you
could do it with a partner,

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:84%
but one way to start
is with yourself

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.222 align:middle line:84%
through self-pleasuring,
you know, light the candles,

00:32:06.222 --> 00:32:07.930 align:middle line:84%
put on the music, take
the bath, whatever

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:90%
it is that gets you interested.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And really start
caressing yourself,

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and get yourself turned on
and really stimulate yourself

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.797 align:middle line:84%
sexually to a point
of really getting--

00:32:18.797 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:84%
get as close as you can
to the point of no return,

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.770 align:middle line:90%
but you could still back off.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:24.989 align:middle line:84%
Now that may feel really
uncomfortable to not go

00:32:24.989 --> 00:32:27.030 align:middle line:84%
all the way because you
really do want a release.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh damn, I'm
so close to orgasm.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:29.476 align:middle line:90%
Can't I just keep going for it?

00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:30.546 align:middle line:90%
Very frustrating, yes.

00:32:30.546 --> 00:32:35.435 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But if you want
to, you can back off and then

00:32:35.435 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:90%
do other things for a while.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Dance, sing, put on music,
or go about your day,

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.667 align:middle line:84%
and you may not even
come back to it,

00:32:42.667 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:90%
but you'll have a lot of energy.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Or if you come back to it and
then start pleasuring yourself

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:84%
again, you'll find
that you can even

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.010 align:middle line:84%
have a more powerful
orgasm because there's

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:53.425 align:middle line:90%
more energy built up to it.

00:32:53.425 --> 00:32:54.925 align:middle line:84%
It's like that
balloon has expanded.

00:32:54.925 --> 00:32:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can experience
more pleasure

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.450 align:middle line:84%
before the orgasm
occurs, and then it

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.340 align:middle line:90%
can be a more powerful orgasm.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.135 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
in partner lovemaking

00:33:03.135 --> 00:33:05.185 align:middle line:84%
where you could get
close, and you back off,

00:33:05.185 --> 00:33:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and you get close,
and you back off,

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and you learn just
in synchronization

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:84%
with your partner,
you may not both get

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
close at the same time,
but as you do that

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and you back off, you get to
a point where when you finally

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.840 align:middle line:84%
do climax, if that's
how you're going,

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.785 align:middle line:84%
then it'll be much
more powerful.

00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More potential
for whole body.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:25.495 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:33:25.495 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Or you may enter what I
call an orgasmic state.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.736 align:middle line:84%
In tantra, they often call
it like a valley orgasm.

00:33:33.736 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But it gets to a
place where it's

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.660 align:middle line:90%
like riding orgasmic waves.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite the
same as a peak orgasm.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.676 align:middle line:90%
You can still do that.

00:33:41.676 --> 00:33:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's like-- this is when
you hear about people having

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:50.395 align:middle line:84%
an orgasm for hours, is they
tap into that orgasmic state,

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's like surfing
or riding the waves.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:53.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a surfer.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.489 align:middle line:90%
I'm totally flat terrain.

00:33:55.489 --> 00:33:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Feels like surfing.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.790 align:middle line:90%
That's very enticing.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
people that don't

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.540 align:middle line:84%
know how to do these things,
they don't have the skill

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.306 align:middle line:84%
set developed yet, try to
do it through other means,

00:34:07.306 --> 00:34:09.555 align:middle line:84%
and I alluded to this at the
top of the conversation--

00:34:09.555 --> 00:34:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to ask you
about this-- and that

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.366 align:middle line:84%
includes drugs to try
to reach that state.

00:34:14.366 --> 00:34:15.865 align:middle line:84%
Well, sex, drugs,
and rock and roll.

00:34:15.865 --> 00:34:16.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.530 align:middle line:84%
There you have the '60s, '70s,
'80s, '90s, 2000, sex, drugs,

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and rock and roll.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.679 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
very specific kinds

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:84%
of drugs, psychotropic
drugs, ecstasy,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
for example, that people
have used and attempted

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.270 align:middle line:84%
to use in kind of
an experimental way

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to see how far they could
go in opening themselves.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.201 align:middle line:84%
And I had one
experience that way,

00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:84%
which I'll tell
you about a minute,

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:84%
but what is your view
of that, and what

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.515 align:middle line:84%
have you seen as the
end result of that?

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, I do know
people have said, how do I

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.112 align:middle line:84%
get off of needing
marijuana just to enjoy sex.

00:34:52.112 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth is,
biochemically, it's

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
going to heighten your
sensory perception,

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:84%
probably more than theta
brain wave entrainment will.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.376 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.376 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much we can do to
heighten our sexual experience

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.490 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want to feel like
you're stuck having to have

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:84%
gone to all the time
in order to enjoy sex.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And there is so much you
can do, and the other thing

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:22.973 align:middle line:84%
about marijuana is, it can
tend to-- it can heighten

00:35:22.973 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:84%
your sensory perception and
your energetic perception so

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:84%
much that you often become
sort of in yourself and not

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.285 align:middle line:84%
necessarily as much
connected with your partner.

00:35:31.285 --> 00:35:34.711 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's-- you know,
the truth is there's an up

00:35:34.711 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:90%
and down.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a trade
off for everything.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
one of the trade offs

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:84%
is you don't necessarily-- you
may be both-- you're sharing

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.270 align:middle line:84%
an experience, but
it's not necessarily

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:45.980 align:middle line:90%
a shared experience.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:46.805 --> 00:35:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: You're more separate
than trying to do it together.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that brings
me that little scenario

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know
if I should mention,

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.025 align:middle line:84%
but I'll go ahead and mention
it just because it's really,

00:35:58.025 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
that uncommon,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.120 align:middle line:84%
but one time, my partner
and I, at the time,

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:90%
he was in an experimental phase.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, let's try ecstasy
together, and I don't do drugs,

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'd never taken ecstasy,
but I said, well, OK.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's give it a shot.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And what happened for me was
a totally solo experience.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and I think his
hope was that it would

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.790 align:middle line:84%
be this beautiful
blending together,

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:84%
but I was having
a wonderful time.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was-- But the problem
is I was not in my body at all.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And see that's
what I'm wondering.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was so far detached
from the physical world,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I was outside myself watching,
and I looked comatose actually.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:90%
And he was quite frightened.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.520 align:middle line:90%
He thought whoa.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.276 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:36:43.276 --> 00:36:44.400 align:middle line:90%
He was like, are you there?

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:44.983 align:middle line:90%
Are you there?

00:36:44.983 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I was observing
from outside of my body,

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.505 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what a shame that
he's so concerned because this

00:36:51.505 --> 00:36:55.260 align:middle line:84%
is such a wonderful
experience, but it had nothing

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.430 align:middle line:84%
to do, unfortunately, with
connecting with each other.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's another thing is
this whole thing about rising

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and rising and connection,
and a lot of people

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.120 align:middle line:84%
put a value on this rising to a
state where you're out of body.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be
out of body if you're

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.840 align:middle line:90%
having an ecstatic experience.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.764 align:middle line:84%
I would assume you want to be
very present and in your body.

00:37:14.764 --> 00:37:14.782 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:37:14.782 --> 00:37:14.873 align:middle line:90%
Because you could be meditating.

00:37:14.873 --> 00:37:15.623 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:15.623 --> 00:37:18.680 align:middle line:84%
You can do that, getting
out of the body, meditating.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.483 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I found in it was

00:37:20.483 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:84%
it became a very
self-oriented thing.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.257 align:middle line:84%
It really wasn't a
connected thing at all.

00:37:25.257 --> 00:37:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you've
heard that kind of experience

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:84%
with other people like
you said smoking grass.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.906 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's a
typical-- I've heard that

00:37:33.906 --> 00:37:35.507 align:middle line:84%
from a lot of people,
that it ends up

00:37:35.507 --> 00:37:37.590 align:middle line:84%
being two people together
having solo experiences.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.745 align:middle line:84%
So that's not exactly the
connected, ecstatic sex

00:37:41.745 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about and
that we can groom ourselves

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:90%
toward with.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But a
couple that wants

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.080 align:middle line:84%
a little variety
in their love life,

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to do that every once in a
while, it's not a bad thing,

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.315 align:middle line:90%
it's just different.

00:37:50.315 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just different.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.675 align:middle line:84%
It's just not
necessarily connected.

00:37:52.675 --> 00:37:54.675 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: If it's instead
of really connecting,

00:37:54.675 --> 00:37:56.115 align:middle line:90%
you might want to look at that.

00:37:56.115 --> 00:37:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I wouldn't
replicate that experience now.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: I don't mean that.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:37:59.420 align:middle line:90%
One.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.711 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was great for
myself, but very frightening

00:38:01.711 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:90%
for the other person.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.390 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion of tantra,
because well, I live in Sedona,

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and in Sedona, you see a lot of
tantra groups coming through,

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.830 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the tantra temples.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I've got the
same thing going on.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:13.676 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they've
been shut down.

00:38:13.676 --> 00:38:15.910 align:middle line:84%
You know the police
officials have come and shut

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.120 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these places down.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Oh, really?

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.231 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:38:18.231 --> 00:38:19.430 align:middle line:90%
In Phoenix and Sedona.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Shut 'em
down all over the place.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They've shut a lot of
them down because people

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.230 align:middle line:84%
are seeking this
is something more,

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.320 align:middle line:84%
but this isn't really
again what you're

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.920 align:middle line:84%
talking about either
in a lot of cases

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.610 align:middle line:84%
because when I see the
groups come into town, to me

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.540 align:middle line:84%
it's more like
something from the '70s

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.340 align:middle line:84%
as you know sex, drugs,
and rock and roll.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's just all get
high on each other

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.850 align:middle line:90%
and have sex with each other.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not hearing too much
about the spiritual component

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.420 align:middle line:84%
of it in a lot of these
tantric practices now.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:90%
That call themselves tantric.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I think
that the ancients who

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
developed the Dalit sexual
practices and tantra practices

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.630 align:middle line:90%
knew a lot.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.814 align:middle line:90%
We've touched on some of that.

00:38:59.814 --> 00:39:02.485 align:middle line:84%
But so did Jesus,
but Christianity

00:39:02.485 --> 00:39:06.360 align:middle line:84%
has been distorted into so many
different lines that you know,

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.110 align:middle line:84%
you might say are very
different from what

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.143 align:middle line:84%
the original intention of
Christianity might have been

00:39:11.143 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:90%
or what I like to think it was.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is certainly
true with tantra,

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:21.115 align:middle line:84%
that tantra came to the
west along with Zen Buddhism

00:39:21.115 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of Eastern
spiritual traditions,

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and then all of
these different-- I

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:30.190 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't even call them lineages
anymore relative to tantra.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.646 align:middle line:84%
First of all, sexuality is
only one line of tantra.

00:39:32.646 --> 00:39:35.020 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, eight limbs of
tantra, and sex is only one

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.760 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think they've
gotten distorted a lot.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.928 align:middle line:84%
People have taken
little bits and pieces,

00:39:38.928 --> 00:39:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's been sort of a way
to do exactly what you were

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:84%
describing, and in
some cases, I've

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.740 align:middle line:84%
known couples who have gone to
tantra workshops and walked out

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:84%
because it can be
very predatory.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.142 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm speaking of.

00:39:51.142 --> 00:39:52.517 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And
the other side is,

00:39:52.517 --> 00:39:54.308 align:middle line:84%
I've been in tantra
workshops where they're

00:39:54.308 --> 00:39:58.200 align:middle line:84%
very rich and supportive
to individuals and couples

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.739 align:middle line:84%
and very, very nurturing
and very high frequency.

00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds like you just
need to know who these people,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:05.860 align:middle line:90%
these facilitators--

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: So, if that's
something you want to explore,

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.072 align:middle line:84%
you need to talk
to the leaders who

00:40:09.072 --> 00:40:10.530 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
running the groups,

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.080 align:middle line:84%
ask for references, people
that have been in the groups,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.555 align:middle line:84%
and just really try to learn
what you can and tune in

00:40:15.555 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:90%
and follow your intuition.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.519 align:middle line:84%
And don't be afraid to walk
out if it doesn't feel right.

00:40:19.519 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:20.510 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for that, because
a lot of people are thinking,

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:84%
oh I've read about
a tantric workshop,

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.930 align:middle line:84%
so they're not
all created equal.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.997 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is,
even if it's one

00:40:27.997 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that's skewed more
toward just physical sex,

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:31.170 align:middle line:90%
maybe that is right for you.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Sure.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.512 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just, like
you say, just research,

00:40:33.512 --> 00:40:34.970 align:middle line:84%
figure out what
your priorities are

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and how you want to approach
it, and go from there.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.675 align:middle line:84%
What about the subject
of body imagery?

00:40:40.675 --> 00:40:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and here,
we're trying to get

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.600 align:middle line:84%
into this open state of
acceptance of self, acceptance

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
of other and connection,
yet we have an epidemic

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:84%
of self-loathing in the
Western world because

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
of really entrainment by
the advertising agencies,

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and you can call it whomever,
where women, in particular,

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.392 align:middle line:84%
seem to have real
self-destructive beliefs

00:41:05.392 --> 00:41:06.350 align:middle line:90%
about their own bodies.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.432 align:middle line:84%
And it's really sad because it's
effecting younger and younger

00:41:09.432 --> 00:41:11.640 align:middle line:84%
ages to where young girls
are having eating disorders

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.540 align:middle line:84%
because they're trying to look
the way they think they're

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.280 align:middle line:84%
supposed to look by
the standards they see

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:84%
in magazines, and in
film, and so forth.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's really sad.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Most men don't necessarily
love skinny women,

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and yet that seems
to be the direction.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, real
women walking around

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:36.442 align:middle line:84%
aren't air brushed and trimmed
for-- aren't Photoshopped.

00:41:36.442 --> 00:41:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
have a contract that

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:84%
says you can't go to work
until you reach a size

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.540 align:middle line:90%
0 to 2, either.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.654 align:middle line:84%
And eating is a sensual
experience for a lot of people.

00:41:47.654 --> 00:41:49.695 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, eating
can also be an emotional--

00:41:49.695 --> 00:41:50.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --issue.

00:41:50.615 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And we could talk
about all of that.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're talking
about dysfunction, obesity

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:90%
and all.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not talking about that.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And you
know, as people

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.955 align:middle line:84%
get older, their body--
especially menopause,

00:41:58.955 --> 00:42:01.960 align:middle line:84%
their bodies
change, and there is

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of self-loathing
and concern.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.202 align:middle line:84%
A lot of men have
the problem, too,

00:42:05.202 --> 00:42:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and of course, there's other
issues as men get older.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.048 align:middle line:90%


00:42:10.048 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do
you guide people

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.620 align:middle line:84%
that really are starting
with that kind of a mindset?

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they want
to be connected,

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:84%
but they're so shy, so
embarrassed, I mean, just can't

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.280 align:middle line:84%
bear to be seen
naked, for example.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:23.946 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:42:23.946 --> 00:42:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a real issue for
people, especially women, who

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
end a relationship and they're
like in their '40s or '50s,

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.275 align:middle line:84%
and now they're getting
back out into dating.

00:42:34.275 --> 00:42:35.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, ah.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.537 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:42:36.537 --> 00:42:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm not perfect.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Right.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think one
thing they've proven,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.940 align:middle line:84%
there's been lots
of research on this,

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that one thing that men find
most attractive in a woman

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.225 align:middle line:90%
is confidence--

00:42:49.225 --> 00:42:50.184 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:42:50.184 --> 00:42:51.225 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: --and smiling.

00:42:51.225 --> 00:42:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Look at Queen Latifah.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.990 align:middle line:90%
She's just a great example.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She's very sexy.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And it's
confidence and smiling

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:03.980 align:middle line:84%
at that particular
man and in general.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But giving him the smile,
the smile, the invitation.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.787 align:middle line:84%
And these are things, in
addition to shiny hair,

00:43:11.787 --> 00:43:14.120 align:middle line:84%
which is why-- and this is
like a whole biological thing

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.730 align:middle line:84%
because shiny hair evolutionary
wise indicated fertility

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.580 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, estrogen.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So these are things
that we can all do.

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:84%
We can all improve
our self-confidence.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.473 align:middle line:84%
We can all smile, and we
can all get hair products

00:43:25.473 --> 00:43:26.720 align:middle line:90%
to shine our hair.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I think those are
the most important.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it gets to point of
being naked and being in bed,

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.580 align:middle line:90%
men care-- I mean, yes.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.500 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is really obese,
I mean, some men go for that,

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.200 align:middle line:90%
but more don't.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.800 align:middle line:84%
But an extra 10 or
15 pounds even 20

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:84%
is not really the
issue for most men.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.850 align:middle line:84%
They want somebody who's
into her sexuality.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They want a woman
who's sensual, who's

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.670 align:middle line:84%
confident in her
sexuality, who can

00:43:52.670 --> 00:44:01.860 align:middle line:84%
be spontaneous and expressive
sexually, and who is into them.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Every lover, male, female,
otherwise, heterosexual,

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:09.730 align:middle line:84%
homosexual, bi, wants their
partner to be into them.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, the truth is yes.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.245 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: That's what's
the most exciting and sexy

00:44:14.245 --> 00:44:16.025 align:middle line:84%
is if your partner is
like totally jazzed,

00:44:16.025 --> 00:44:18.010 align:middle line:84%
turned on to you,
and wants to help

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.410 align:middle line:90%
you have pleasure and share it.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --wants to connect.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.990 align:middle line:90%
And also numbers don't lie.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.200 align:middle line:84%
There are over 7
billion of us, very few

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.870 align:middle line:84%
have the absolutely
perfect Hollywood

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:33.002 align:middle line:84%
version of perfect body, yet we
manage to procreate just fine.

00:44:33.002 --> 00:44:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And I
was in a workshop,

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and a woman asked a
question to this man.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a woman's workshop
and a male panel.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.942 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember what the
question was, but this one

00:44:41.942 --> 00:44:43.900 align:middle line:84%
guy-- because it was
about this general topic--

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and one man said,
no matter what shape

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.460 align:middle line:84%
your butt's in there's some
guy out there digging on it.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.430 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Candle light
is always a good thing,

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.910 align:middle line:84%
because candle light as
well is very flattering.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:01.912 align:middle line:84%
And this was years ago, I
read a very interesting bit

00:45:01.912 --> 00:45:03.370 align:middle line:84%
of research that
had been conducted

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:06.240 align:middle line:84%
that was showing at the
time "Omni Magazine."

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was about male and female
self-perception of their bodies

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and how they felt
about themselves,

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.500 align:middle line:84%
but also what they thought
the other sex felt about them.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And the findings
were that women--

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:23.500 align:middle line:84%
you had to choose body
types by way of imagery,

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.822 align:middle line:84%
and there were other elements
to the little self test

00:45:26.822 --> 00:45:28.280 align:middle line:84%
that these women
were administered.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And the women ended up thinking
that they were fatter and less

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:36.192 align:middle line:84%
attractive than
they actually were.

00:45:36.192 --> 00:45:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And the
men were the opposite.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The men
were the opposite.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I don't know
where that came from.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'd say,
"Which body most likely

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:43.380 align:middle line:90%
reflects yours?"

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And the women would put the
one that wasn't as shapely

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.870 align:middle line:84%
or was overweight more so
than she might even be.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.665 align:middle line:84%
The men went, which body
most closely resembles yours?

00:45:52.665 --> 00:45:55.042 align:middle line:90%
And they'd choose Mr. Adonis.

00:45:55.042 --> 00:45:57.785 align:middle line:84%
And It's like,
what's up with that?

00:45:57.785 --> 00:45:59.686 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: I wish I knew.

00:45:59.686 --> 00:46:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Although I do
think there's a bit

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.700 align:middle line:84%
of a trend to men being
a little more conscious.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --more
self-conscious now.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.010 align:middle line:84%
That's true because Hollywood's
doing the same thing.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I think
you're absolutely right,

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.275 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
where it came from.

00:46:08.275 --> 00:46:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found it
fascinating because it

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.050 align:middle line:84%
does create this problem
with women in general

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.860 align:middle line:90%
on the self-confidence sexually.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But do
other thing really

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.520 align:middle line:90%
had to do with the spontaneity.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I did a survey of
my subscriber list,

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and although I did have
specific kind of multiple choice

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:27.404 align:middle line:84%
questions, I also had
two open-ended questions

00:46:27.404 --> 00:46:28.903 align:middle line:84%
about what they
wanted most and what

00:46:28.903 --> 00:46:30.890 align:middle line:84%
they were-- biggest
concerns and so forth.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And it took a long time to sort
out these free-form answers,

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.910 align:middle line:84%
but I started to
see these patterns.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
men wanted to be

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.560 align:middle line:84%
able to satisfy their
partners in bed.

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.334 align:middle line:84%
Of course, women
want to be satisfied.

00:46:48.334 --> 00:46:48.875 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:46:48.875 --> 00:46:50.545 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of that
yin-yang thing.

00:46:50.545 --> 00:46:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And men wanted their
partners-- and this is the part

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.559 align:middle line:84%
that kind of relates
to what you're

00:46:58.559 --> 00:47:00.350 align:middle line:84%
saying about being
sexually attracted-- men

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:03.360 align:middle line:84%
want their partners to be
able to let go, get out

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:84%
of their heads, and
be spontaneous in bed.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.410 align:middle line:90%
What did women want?

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.326 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be able
to get out there heads,

00:47:10.326 --> 00:47:12.710 align:middle line:84%
to be able to let go, and
be spontaneous in bed.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
we can work on

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.720 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves is to be able
to get more into our body

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and be more free and spontaneous
and to trust more and all

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.380 align:middle line:84%
that because that's
going to make

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.865 align:middle line:84%
men want to have
sex with you again.

00:47:29.865 --> 00:47:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, in lieu of
that, society also

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:84%
has some other
patterns, particularly

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.160 align:middle line:84%
men who are feeling
disconnected, dissatisfied,

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and what not, in the
form of pornography,

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:90%
which is really rampant now.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like video
games in an entrainment level.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Video games are entraining
these little boys, drone killer,

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.990 align:middle line:84%
killing via drone
is just a game.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:55.415 align:middle line:90%
What happens when you're--

00:47:55.415 --> 00:47:56.498 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Disassociation.

00:47:56.498 --> 00:47:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --deeply
involved in pornography?

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know of some
guys who can't even

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:84%
have sex with a woman without
watching porn at the same time.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's a disorder.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it's unfortunate
that-- I mean,

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a judgment
against porn in general.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think so many young
guys getting into it so early,

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:19.060 align:middle line:84%
they start to create
expectations around sexuality.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about them
rather than as much of a

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.090 align:middle line:90%
shared giving experience.

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And the rapidity
with which women

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.340 align:middle line:84%
are going to get turned
on is totally distorted.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just
it's a distortion.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.987 align:middle line:84%
So then they have to
learn real sex after that.

00:48:35.987 --> 00:48:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's great for
letting them understand

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:41.210 align:middle line:84%
body parts and all that,
but I think it's a problem.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
some research that's

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:84%
shown that men who have
deep and fulfilling sex

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.520 align:middle line:84%
lives with a partner
that they love,

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.200 align:middle line:84%
their porn
consumption goes down.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It tends to.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:53.834 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it can
be chicken or egg.

00:48:53.834 --> 00:48:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.460 align:middle line:90%
All right. .

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.844 align:middle line:90%
Yeah that makes sense.

00:48:57.844 --> 00:49:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking at it more
from a brain entrainment

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.940 align:middle line:84%
point of view, and
it does make sense.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that an
expectation goes up.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.840 align:middle line:84%
There are certain chemicals
the brain secretes

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.734 align:middle line:84%
when you're in states of
extreme excitation, whether,

00:49:11.734 --> 00:49:13.400 align:middle line:84%
like I said, whether
it's a video game--

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: True.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --or whether it's
pornography or anything that's

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:16.020 align:middle line:90%
extreme.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And it can also
create a Pavlovian response

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:84%
because men are
typically, they're

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:21.590 align:middle line:84%
self-stimulating when
they're watching porn.

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And so
then they often tend

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.680 align:middle line:84%
to not-- they can move in
toward premature ejaculation,

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.407 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
interacting with a person,

00:49:30.407 --> 00:49:32.240 align:middle line:84%
they're not taking that
time, so now they've

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:36.422 align:middle line:84%
got their own stimulus response,
sort of in a short time frame.

00:49:36.422 --> 00:49:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as men are
more visually oriented

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.140 align:middle line:84%
than women to begin with, then
what happens when you're really

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.780 align:middle line:84%
watching porn stars
as your reflection

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.530 align:middle line:90%
of the feminine essence.

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.645 align:middle line:84%
Then how do you match
that in real life?

00:49:49.645 --> 00:49:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well, there's quite
a bit of therapeutic business

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.810 align:middle line:84%
for men trying to wean
themselves from porn.

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm not surprised at that.

00:49:58.890 --> 00:49:59.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go into
the resonances.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We talked about this a little
bit in the last interview,

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:08.170 align:middle line:84%
but I want to go deeper
into the musical portion

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and what you've done
there and the layering.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear a couple of
stories about how people

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.840 align:middle line:84%
are responding to this music,
"Love Unbound, Music for Better

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Sex" that we have here.

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about maybe
a couple tough cases

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.061 align:middle line:84%
that just thought they
could never weave it

00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:25.930 align:middle line:84%
back together maybe that
had some success with this?

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.614 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Sure.

00:50:28.614 --> 00:50:30.530 align:middle line:84%
People who could never
weave it back together.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meaning the
relationship was so fractured,

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:35.700 align:middle line:84%
where they've been able
to use technology even,

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.180 align:middle line:90%
to find their way back together.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: So basically
to kind of give you

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.350 align:middle line:84%
the context, these four
keys that I presented

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:44.150 align:middle line:84%
in this workshop I eventually
developed into a lovemaking

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:48.440 align:middle line:84%
enhancement system,
and it had this music

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.810 align:middle line:84%
for lovemaking in
it, but it also

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:55.440 align:middle line:84%
had about two and a half
hours worth of information

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.940 align:middle line:84%
really where I was just kind
of teaching them these four

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:01.070 align:middle line:84%
keys to sexual ecstasy including
ways to build and circulate

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:03.940 align:middle line:84%
sexual energy and
also addressed,

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.330 align:middle line:84%
like, four common obstacles
people experience on the road

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:12.383 align:middle line:84%
to deeper intimacy and
how to overcome them.

00:51:12.383 --> 00:51:15.635 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a third CD--
so I called those first two

00:51:15.635 --> 00:51:19.446 align:middle line:90%
CDs, "The Living Room Seminar."

00:51:19.446 --> 00:51:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Then the third CD was
"The Bedroom Seminar,"

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.870 align:middle line:84%
which was taking these
exercises I did in this workshop

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:30.910 align:middle line:84%
into a more intimate,
sensual, sexual situation.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But basically incorporating
these four keys

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.140 align:middle line:84%
you've learned about
intellectually,

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.530 align:middle line:84%
in your beta brain, into
your physical and emotional

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:39.930 align:middle line:90%
experience with your partner.

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't really
learn things until we

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:43.230 align:middle line:90%
experience them.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.813 align:middle line:84%
Like you can learn
about driving cars,

00:51:44.813 --> 00:51:46.490 align:middle line:84%
but until you get in
that driver's seat,

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:50.300 align:middle line:84%
you don't really know
how to drive a car.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So I guide people into
a state of deep intimacy

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and then segue-- non-sexual
intimacy, segueing

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.090 align:middle line:84%
into sensual massage, and
then sort of a guided foreplay

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:02.750 align:middle line:84%
all the while incorporating
these keys of trust,

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:04.560 align:middle line:84%
entrainment,
absorption, and building

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.797 align:middle line:84%
and circulating sexual
energy, and all the ways

00:52:07.797 --> 00:52:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
talking about and more.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And this music all the while
is playing on this CD as well,

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and then it ends with about
20 minutes of just the music.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, the music for lovemaking,
actually it's two CDs,

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.900 align:middle line:84%
because what we found is that
it helps-- one of the attributes

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that this music with these
resonant frequencies,

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:30.590 align:middle line:84%
which I'm calling them
auditory pheromones, is it

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.505 align:middle line:90%
helps break up patterns.

00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about how we
could have blocks in our energy

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.080 align:middle line:84%
system, and it helps to
sort of like naturally

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.210 align:middle line:90%
break up patterns.

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.222 align:middle line:84%
We worked really hard
to get that in there.

00:52:41.222 --> 00:52:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's hard to
do it with talk therapy.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:44.070 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: It doesn't work.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.615 align:middle line:84%
Because the paterns go in on the
physical and emotional level,

00:52:49.615 --> 00:52:51.270 align:middle line:84%
so the mental level
isn't really going

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to be the access root to
finding and dissolving those.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But energy frequencies can help
do that very gently and softly.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.880 align:middle line:84%
But people wanted to be able to
have the benefit of breaking up

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.440 align:middle line:84%
patterns without listening to
music that was going to-- so

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.659 align:middle line:84%
this music for lovemaking, you
can't listen while driving.

00:53:14.659 --> 00:53:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I learned that the hard way
when we were developing it.

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I was driving out of
the Oakland airport one night,

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:20.840 align:middle line:90%
and I know the way home.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.944 align:middle line:84%
And I got totally lost, and I
thought, what's going on here?

00:53:23.944 --> 00:53:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Theta.

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Oh, I am totally
spaced out on this music.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.490 align:middle line:90%
So we had to call my attorney.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.172 align:middle line:84%
We slapped a warning on the
packaging and then said,

00:53:32.172 --> 00:53:32.880 align:middle line:90%
people want this.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So we actually took
the same music with--

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and threw some beta
entrainment in it

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:42.510 align:middle line:84%
so we would have-- keep a
little more conscious awareness,

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and a slightly different
formula of resonant frequencies

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:47.540 align:middle line:84%
so people could enjoy the
same benefits of breaking up

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.200 align:middle line:84%
patterns and moving
their sensual energy,

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and they could listen
to it all the time.

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:56.147 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a system of
five which includes a book,

00:53:56.147 --> 00:53:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and coaching calls, and
stuff, so that's a system,

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.104 align:middle line:84%
but then people really
just wanted the music.

00:54:00.104 --> 00:54:05.045 align:middle line:84%
So I just recently repackaged
just the music, but both CDs.

00:54:05.045 --> 00:54:06.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
a brilliant idea,

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.760 align:middle line:10%
because it bypasses the mind
and all the heavy lifting

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.300 align:middle line:10%
the mind has to
do to try to find

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.920 align:middle line:10%
its way around its
obstacle courses.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:10%
>>EATOUGH: Yes.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I've had a number
of women tell me

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:17.660 align:middle line:84%
they've purchased
the whole program

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.993 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to work
with their own sexual energy

00:54:19.993 --> 00:54:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and they often
were single women,

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to prepare
for the next relationship.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And I got a beautiful
series of emails

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.840 align:middle line:84%
from one woman who had been
single for many, many years,

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:40.280 align:middle line:84%
really wanted a partner, just
wasn't even meeting anybody

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.000 align:middle line:90%
although she was trying.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.534 align:middle line:84%
And she felt that her sexual
energy was kind of blocked

00:54:44.534 --> 00:54:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and restricted and so forth.

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.240 align:middle line:90%
So she got the set.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.569 align:middle line:90%
She was listening to the music.

00:54:49.569 --> 00:54:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, she was listening to
the music for everyday use

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.640 align:middle line:84%
while she was
driving to work back

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.180 align:middle line:90%
and forth for a couple of weeks.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know, she started

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:02.230 align:middle line:84%
feeling more open, more sensual,
more in touch with her body,

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.355 align:middle line:84%
and men started approaching her
for the first time in her life.

00:55:05.355 --> 00:55:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: And it was just like
she was just more receptive

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.157 align:middle line:90%
and just felt more feminine--

00:55:15.157 --> 00:55:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:17.156 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: --and more juicy.

00:55:17.156 --> 00:55:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And she signed off
as "in a relationship

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:21.590 align:middle line:84%
with one amazing
47-year-old man."

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:22.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wonderful.

00:55:22.645 --> 00:55:25.949 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: So it was just a
great testimonial to that.

00:55:25.949 --> 00:55:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes sense.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.573 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're
going as a culture.

00:55:28.573 --> 00:55:29.890 align:middle line:90%
We're going to that.

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And the healing of
the future is all

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.988 align:middle line:90%
going to be frequency driven.

00:55:31.988 --> 00:55:33.601 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: And I had a couple.

00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:36.100 align:middle line:84%
This guy, he and his wife were
in their 30s, had three kids,

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and they had a
great relationship.

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Every standard, you
know, his standard

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.030 align:middle line:90%
except for their sex life.

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.904 align:middle line:84%
And they hadn't had sex
until they got married

00:55:45.904 --> 00:55:47.570 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
she wanted, and he'd

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:49.690 align:middle line:84%
had some other great
experiences before they met.

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But he said it was very
passionate before they

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.075 align:middle line:84%
got married, so he was
really looking forward

00:55:53.075 --> 00:55:55.894 align:middle line:90%
to that honeymoon.

00:55:55.894 --> 00:55:58.170 align:middle line:90%
So it was very disappointing.

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They had sex like twice in
a week on their honeymoon,

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and she was just like stiff,
and that passionate woman

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.770 align:middle line:90%
he knew-- where did she go?

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.510 align:middle line:90%
And so they used the system.

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:11.350 align:middle line:84%
They went through
the whole thing.

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They did do the guided
experience, that third CD.

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said they started
going into this intimacy.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.680 align:middle line:84%
He said it was like-- this
is before it even go sexual.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:23.462 align:middle line:84%
He said he tapped into
this love for her.

00:56:23.462 --> 00:56:26.810 align:middle line:84%
He felt like he hadn't
felt since 13 years

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:29.169 align:middle line:84%
before when they were
standing at the altar saying

00:56:29.169 --> 00:56:30.210 align:middle line:90%
their vows to each other.

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:33.190 align:middle line:84%
He tapped into
that love for her.

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And then as they
did that, and also

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.580 align:middle line:84%
when they were just using
the music for lovemaking,

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.590 align:middle line:84%
he said it's like she
became this wild woman,

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:40.980 align:middle line:90%
this spontaneous woman.

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.789 align:middle line:90%
It's like she just let go.

00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And they found themselves using
all these different positions

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that they never tried and
just sex went on longer.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It was more passionate.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:55.680 align:middle line:84%
She was just freer, and it
was just really wonderful.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what a service
you've done in creating these.

00:56:58.248 --> 00:56:58.914 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:56:58.914 --> 00:57:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And I get that kind
of story a lot.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --a lot.

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for sharing both
of those experiences with us.

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:06.330 align:middle line:84%
We only have a few
minutes left now,

00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and so I wanted to
ask you what advice

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.330 align:middle line:84%
do you give to parents
for sons and daughters

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:13.280 align:middle line:84%
before they even
set down the road

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.580 align:middle line:90%
into super unhealthy patterns.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the culture is pretty
aggressive right now, sexually.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.520 align:middle line:90%


00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Victoria's Secret is
now for 13-year-olds.

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:26.280 align:middle line:90%
It didn't used to be.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: Well one is, it's
really important for boys

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and girls to be
guided to really be

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:34.880 align:middle line:84%
aware of their own
values, their own needs

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.324 align:middle line:84%
and how it's really tough,
but to help keep them out

00:57:39.324 --> 00:57:41.740 align:middle line:84%
of situations where they're
going to get lots of pressure.

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's lots of
pressure in my community

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:45.610 align:middle line:84%
for middle school girls
getting pressured to give

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:46.345 align:middle line:90%
blow jobs to their boyfriends.

00:57:46.345 --> 00:57:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
bathroom at school even.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Yeah.

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:48.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Little kids.

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: But
guide them to-- you

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.641 align:middle line:90%
are valuable in and of yourself.

00:57:53.641 --> 00:57:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Because a particular person
wants you to do something,

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:57.139 align:middle line:90%
it's not worth the trade-offs.

00:57:57.139 --> 00:57:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And kind of help them see
the potential future in it.

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But also, I think
parents do well

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:06.490 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate their own love
relationship because there's

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:10.210 align:middle line:84%
this not only their
modeling but their energy

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:13.620 align:middle line:84%
has a huge spillover
effect in the family.

00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And when kids start
to see that there's

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.080 align:middle line:84%
more potentially than
just sex and that somebody

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:24.220 align:middle line:84%
demanding sexual favors
or anything from you

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.500 align:middle line:84%
when you're not ready
for it is not love.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.419 align:middle line:84%
It's not trustworthy,
and I think

00:58:30.419 --> 00:58:32.460 align:middle line:84%
it's just really important
to plant these values.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:33.876 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
just really hard,

00:58:33.876 --> 00:58:37.656 align:middle line:84%
and I think you've got to start
talking to kids really early.

00:58:37.656 --> 00:58:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.590 align:middle line:90%
I thinks so too.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for both interviews.

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:45.976 align:middle line:84%
Very enlightening and for
creating this technology,

00:58:45.976 --> 00:58:47.350 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people are going

00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:49.827 align:middle line:84%
to be interested in tapping
in on a frequency level

00:58:49.827 --> 00:58:50.410 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:51.785 align:middle line:84%
>>EATOUGH: I do
want to say we've

00:58:51.785 --> 00:58:54.580 align:middle line:84%
heard a lot about enhancing
libido for both men and women

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.650 align:middle line:84%
when it's starting to
peter down later in life.

00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:58.994 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, we never
got to that conversation.

00:58:58.994 --> 00:59:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Whole separate conversation.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Another time.

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Ellen.

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EATOUGH: Thank you.

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I appreciate it.

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:07.050 align:middle line:10%
For more of Ellen's wisdom on
developing an open, honest,

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:09.260 align:middle line:10%
and fulfilling, even
ecstatic love life,

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.470 align:middle line:10%
you can connect with her through
her website extatica.com,

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:16.880 align:middle line:10%

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.410 align:middle line:10%
