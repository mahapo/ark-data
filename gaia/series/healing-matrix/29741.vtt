00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Alison, I'm so

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.040 align:middle line:84%
happy to be talking to
you because dentistry

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.754 align:middle line:90%
is so confusing these days.

00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
we're supposed to do,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:90%
not supposed to do.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.645 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see,
your book, your book

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:84%
is "The Natural Recovery
Plan" is well dog eared.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:90%
I've done my research here.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And let's start out
with a general theme

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that really involves your
own personal history, which

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:90%
was the inspiration.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
You're a dentist,
you're a naturopath,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:90%
and you're a kinesiologist.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:84%
You know how body systems
work both biologically and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with your own
story and what happened to you.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ALISON ADAMS: Well, I
was born into a family

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
with a big history of
autoimmune disease,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
although I didn't kind of
reflect upon that until later

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
on in life.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.875 align:middle line:84%
All my family were
always allergic to things

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and had trouble with foods,
and that sort of thing.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't consider it at
all unusual to be that way.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
My health was never good
right from an early age.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I had digestive problems
from really the get go.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:90%
I had musculo-skeletal problems.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I was referred to physiotherapy
and all those sorts of things.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
When I was about five
and I went through 12,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.195 align:middle line:84%
until the age of about 12
I had leg braces at night.

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Horrible physiotherapy now.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I look back on what they did
and I think it was just cruel

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think it make
any difference either.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:90%
I've also have hearing problems.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm deaf in one ear.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:90%
I started on that whole process.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
When I was about 10 I
had my first operation

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.872 align:middle line:84%
and I went on to
have, I think, 19--

00:01:48.872 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 19 operations
for your hearing?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Ear operations, yes.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
All of which was
addressing the symptom

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
but never addressing
the cause, I now see.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:90%
So time went by.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.317 align:middle line:84%
I then hit puberty and my
health took a distinct turn

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:90%
for the worse.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How could
it get much worse?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I mean,
just menstruation.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The whole menstrual cycle,
PMT, bloating all the time.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:90%
I barely felt normal.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I felt normal for a few days
in the middle of the month,

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and then the whole
cycle would kick off.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
To which the doctors' answers
were to put me on the pill

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.650 align:middle line:90%
when I was very young, about 16.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But then it became so I
couldn't get off the pill

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.791 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
horrendous when I did.

00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So I got stuck in that and
I took it for way too long,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.650 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.905 align:middle line:84%
When I was inducted
to university,

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:84%
they actually check
all dental students

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.582 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that their
dental care is OK.

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was found to have been
neglected by my hometown

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:90%
dentist.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So I actually had about
13 amalgam fillings

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
done in the space of
three months or something

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
at dental school.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you mean,
you first had them done?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I had got decay
that had never been treated.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 13?

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.619 align:middle line:84%
And then they put the
mercury fillings in?

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At one time?

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.315 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It went in very
short space of time,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:90%
in a period of a few months.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And on and off,
there's been a history

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
throughout my life of systems
just going down for no reason,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't till I
just really hit a wall.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a whole
series of miscarriages.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
At that point I really
kind of looked around me

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.704 align:middle line:84%
at what had been
going on in my family.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And I realized my
paternal grandmother

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
died when she was
about 42, which

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
was the age I was when all
this started really happening.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
My paternal aunt, she
died at 50 of lupus.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:90%
My cousin's in a wheelchair.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:90%
She's got a lupus type.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
She had juvenile
arthritis and so forth.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So casting around my family I
thought, this isn't just me.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:90%
There's something going on here.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, a set of circumstances
brought me into training

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:90%
as a naturopath.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't at all
what I had planned,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's what I had
to do to get well.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I went to see this lady.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And she put a wheat
vial on my belly,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:84%
which are little test tubes,
really, with a vibration.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And I went down like
a pack of cards.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And then she'd put other
things on and I'd be strong.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just came away,
didn't know what she'd done.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that it was real,
what she was doing was real.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So that launched me into an
investigation of what was it,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:90%
how did it work?

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I enrolled on the
course she'd done.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I then went to do Touch
For Health to augment that

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and got completely
hooked on kinesiology.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do I take it
that as a result of what

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
your findings were
going to the naturopath,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
going to the
kinesiologist, you were

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
able to recover enough
strength that you could go back

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to school and then
do this continuing

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:90%
education into these new areas?

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yes, I mean the school,
most of it was home study.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And you do one weekend a
month or something like that,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:90%
and case studies.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I was following all the
naturopathic-- at that point

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I had really stepped out of
the allopathic camp completely.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that was
a turning point for me was I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:90%
did a liver flush.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't sure about
this thing at all.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.476 align:middle line:84%
But I was absolutely
shocked what came out.

00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.749 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:17.895 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is true.

00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%
What they're saying
is true here.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So after that I was prepared
to really give it a go.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And I knew allopathic
medicine had

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
nothing to offer
me at that stage.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I just
spent a lot of time

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
really cleaning myself
up, doing liver flushes,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:84%
doing clay baths,
taking Chlorella.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And yes, I did.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I recovered to the point
where I could study.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But I became really fascinated
by the people who don't really

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
respond to these
treatments terribly well.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.517 align:middle line:84%
And that took me into, I did
an autonomic response testing

00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:90%
course with Dietrich Klinghardt.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And what he does, he's a
physician and a neurobiologist.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.579 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a technique
that uncovers hidden toxins.

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And once you have that
technique under your belt,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you will find toxic metals
in everybody, just everybody.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So that then became
my fascination.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:90%
And that was the first layer.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:90%
I got my amalgam fillings out.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Then I learned a
little more and decided

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I needed to get the other
metals out of my mouth.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's all been
a bit of a process.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Now I know more
about root canals,

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.373 align:middle line:84%
I think I've really got to get
my root canal filled teeth out,

00:06:23.373 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working on
that at the moment.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.816 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:06:27.816 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't intend, but
I've been brought back

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.477 align:middle line:84%
full circle to dentistry and
how important it is in health.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what a journey.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.303 align:middle line:90%
How exhausting.

00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:37.803 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:37.803 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just, listening
to it, it's like, oh my God.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
What a life.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Thank God you were able to
get the proper information

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.910 align:middle line:90%
and recover yourself.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, forget what you're
doing to help the rest of us.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you're back.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Now from there, going
back to your background

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:84%
in dentistry and then
also holistic medicine.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at the
mouth and the being, the body,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:90%
as a whole system.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:90%
And let's start with the mouth.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
First the intelligence
in the body,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
the way it's utilized through
the meridians of the body,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:90%
and then how that's impacted.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:90%
We all know about reflexology.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Most people.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.210 align:middle line:84%
We have these meridian
endings in our feet.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And many people know we
have them in our hands,

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and even in our ears.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:90%
But let's take it to the mouth.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:84%
What's going on there with
the meridians in the body?

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, it's a
completely different system.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you come into
it with the allopathic way

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.614 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, it will make
no sense to you at all.

00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
say we're going

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
with the Asian understanding,
its roots in China and Japan.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And let's say we're going
to be looking at the body

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:84%
as this matrix of these
energetic meridians running

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:84%
through that are feeding vital
information to all systems

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:90%
and organs.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, the difference
is that allopathic medicine

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
regards the body as a
thing, as a solid thing,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:90%
and we're all separate.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And they look at
biochemical pathways

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and all this sort of thing.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The energy medicine way
of looking at the body

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:90%
is it's not a thing at all.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:90%
It's condensed energy.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Einstein's E equals

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
mc squared told us
over a century ago now.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But that hasn't been absorbed
into the practice of medicine

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
What the Chinese and
Indian philosophies say

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
is that we have a series of
chakras which are transducers,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
which greatly reduce down
universal energies into what

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:84%
we perceive as
being the physical.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
The energy is then circulated
around the meridian.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
You've got two
central meridians that

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.331 align:middle line:84%
run up and down the
middle of the body, which

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:90%
are reservoir meridians.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And they feed into 12
bilateral meridians

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:84%
which actually animate
all the organs.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.126 align:middle line:84%
They come near surface, as you
say, in the ear and the feet

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:90%
and the hands and the face.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
has, by the way,

00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:84%
been quantified in
the world of science.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
In the '80s I interviewed
Jean Claude De Ross,

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.360 align:middle line:84%
the man who did the
original experiments

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.892 align:middle line:84%
that the Asian acupuncturists
were so thrilled to see.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have wanted to
be the subject necessarily,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:84%
but he shot radioactive
isotopes-- very, very low

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
dosages-- into the
meridians and then they

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
watched it migrate through the
body and captured that on film.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time
anyone had seen these meridians

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
in action and how quickly
the energy moves compared

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:84%
to the blood flow in
nearby veins and such.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to say this
has been validated medically.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's been
validated a number of times.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I found some images the
other day, which maybe you'll

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
be able to put on
the site, of they'd

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
used a very sensitive
photon capture technique.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.395 align:middle line:84%
And they'd also used--
oh, I can't remember

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:84%
what it's called, where
you heat the little pellets

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.944 align:middle line:90%
on the skin using acupuncture.

00:10:08.944 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Moxibustion?

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Moxi-- moxi-- moxa.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can see absolutely
that the meridians are showing

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.865 align:middle line:84%
up brilliantly and
absolutely accurately.

00:10:21.865 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely spot on.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's wonderful
these experiments have

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.999 align:middle line:84%
been done to start proving
this so we can take it out

00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:90%
of the range of belief systems.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:90%
No, it's there.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I mean a lot
of dentists who use this,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:84%
it's been proven to
them in their work.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:90%
They've just seen the results.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
As you say, there's
kind of examples.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
One example, a very
strong connection

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
seems to be between
one of what you

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
call second bicuspid or second
pre molar tooth and the breast

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So the problem is
that anything--

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:84%
all the meridians go
through the teeth and all

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:90%
the sockets of the teeth.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And any kind of
blockage there, any kind

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
of galvanic action there, any
kind of necrosis or disease

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
will affect the other
organs on that meridian.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:90%
And the converse is also true.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So that if you were having a
grumbling appendix or something

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:84%
like that, it may result
in a tooth devitalizing

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:84%
for no seeming reason,
becoming hot and cold sensitive

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:90%
and dying, whatever.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you can recognize
what's causing what,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
resolve the issue.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a lot to start
taking in when you really

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:84%
do you get that this body
is a whole living system.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.064 align:middle line:84%
And we treat the mouth as though
it's something very mechanical.

00:11:42.064 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:84%
We treat the whole body
in allopathic medicine

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:90%
as though it's mechanistic.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.547 align:middle line:90%
But it's particularly the teeth.

00:11:47.547 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
We haven't thought anything
of going in and having

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:90%
someone get their

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:90%
[DRILL SOUNDS]

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
their drill out and
going at our teeth.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't think of it as being
vital, but something dead,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, let's
talk about the living

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:84%
organism of the
mouth and how that's

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:84%
interacting with our
own biochemistry.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, the mouth
is crucially important.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is
over the last century

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.814 align:middle line:84%
or so there's arisen these
two completely different--

00:12:13.814 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
so you've got the
medics on the one hand

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.064 align:middle line:84%
who, they spend very little
time learning about the mouth.

00:12:18.064 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them don't even
bother going to that lecture,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:90%
to be honest.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.207 align:middle line:84%
They always seem to prescribe
either painkillers or--

00:12:26.207 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you
said medics, you're

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.099 align:middle line:90%
speaking about medical doctors.

00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Medical doctors, yeah.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So they will just pass
you off to the dentist

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.165 align:middle line:84%
if it's something beyond
their understanding.

00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And then of course
dentists are kind of

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:42.345 align:middle line:84%
really focused on doing the
technical job, which is hard.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a really hard
job of dentistry.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're not really
looking at the longer term

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:90%
effect of what they're doing.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe what happened to the
patient six, nine months,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.870 align:middle line:84%
two years after they did that
crown filling, bridge implant,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.371 align:middle line:90%
took that tooth out or whatever.

00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people just
aren't joining the dots.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But the people who
are skilled and who

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:84%
are conversant with this
say that at least 70% to 90%

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:84%
of disease originates in the
mouth or has some element.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 70% to 90%.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And those are real stats.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just to favor the
holistic dentistry industry?

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.939 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it
started out as being 70%.

00:13:24.939 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:84%
There were people
like Reinhold Voll,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.110 align:middle line:84%
who developed-- he was
a German physician who

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:90%
developed electroacupuncture.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
dentist in naturopath

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
called Gerald Smith and
others like him are actually

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:84%
upping it and saying,
when you really

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.409 align:middle line:84%
understand what's
going on, it's 90%.

00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's important for
all sorts of reasons.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Important for
structural reasons.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.856 align:middle line:84%
It's important because
it's a real big center

00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:53.334 align:middle line:90%
of toxicity in the body.

00:13:53.334 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It's important because
of the meridians.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It's important because
the lymphatic circulation

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:90%
goes straight to the thyroid.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
The blood circulation
goes straight

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:90%
from the mouth to the heart.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.289 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's seen the big
picture and connected.

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.222 align:middle line:84%
Well, we also put
lot of food in there.

00:14:11.222 --> 00:14:11.846 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: We do.

00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's start there
with what we put in our bodies.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of this
ends up as toxicity.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it ends up as
bacteria in our mouths.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
process of decay, OK?

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: OK.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's the
conventional version,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:84%
which has the advantage
of being very simple.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can probably describe
it in one sentence which

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
is that bacteria
adhere to the teeth,

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
particularly a bacteria
called streptococcus mutans.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
They ferment the carbohydrates
and sugars in food

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and they create
acids that dissolves

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:90%
the enamel of the tooth.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And once that's been
penetrated, then the bacteria

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:84%
can actually invade
the body of the tooth,

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:90%
the dentin of the tooth.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's
get the long version.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So that's the
fermentation theory,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:90%
bacterial fermentation.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
The longer question is quite
a lot more complicated.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
proteolysis chelation theory.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.987 align:middle line:84%
And a number of
people have done work

00:15:09.987 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:84%
on this that's all been
sort of confirmatory

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
over quite a long
period of time.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this work was
done a century or 50, 60,

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
70 years ago, but
was disregarded.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And because the whole
bacterial fermentation

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
theory first of all doesn't
really hang together.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Firstly they may be grouping
a number of different diseases

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:90%
and calling them decay.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.049 align:middle line:84%
So that may be a
different disease process.

00:15:38.049 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Like they group everything
together and call it cancer.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.006 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, they may be
completely different processes.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:90%
So right off the bat.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
There's other things like,
yes, sugar does cause decay.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.142 align:middle line:84%
But you can inject it into
somebody under their skin

00:15:53.142 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
or into their veins, whatever,
and it'll still cause decay.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's not actually
the topical effect

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.945 align:middle line:90%
that's causing the decay.

00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
because it's creating

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:90%
an acidic condition in the body?

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, it's a little
bit more complicated than that.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.926 align:middle line:84%
You need to understand
a little bit

00:16:11.926 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:84%
about the structure
of the tooth first,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
which is that there
are three layers.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
There's the outer
enamel which is mostly

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:84%
hydroxyapatite crystals with
a little bit of protein.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's sort
of 98% inorganic.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's a kind of
protective outer coat.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got the dentin
beneath that, which is actually

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.341 align:middle line:90%
made up of lots of tubules.

00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And these tubules are actually
maintained and serviced

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.132 align:middle line:84%
by cells called
odontoblasts, which

00:16:36.132 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
are the cells that
actually created

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:84%
the dentin in first place,
in the baby in the womb.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And they actually act as the
circulation for the dentin.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So they are
delivering nutrients,

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:84%
they're taking away
toxic waste, they're

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.090 align:middle line:90%
repairing the tooth in service.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So any micro cracks
or anything like

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that is actually
being maintained.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.391 align:middle line:84%
So what they found is that decay
doesn't start from the outside

00:17:01.391 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:84%
It actually starts
with the odontoblasts

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.985 align:middle line:84%
being adversely affected
by blood chemistry.

00:17:08.985 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:84%
The odontoblasts are actually
the most metabolically active

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
cells in the body,
and they also work

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.619 align:middle line:90%
at very high osmotic pressures.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So any change from the
homeostatic kind of balance

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:90%
will affect the teeth first.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So what actually
happens is-- and it's

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.407 align:middle line:84%
a little bit complicated-- but
the film of bacteria and food

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:35.990 align:middle line:84%
that forms on the
outside of the tooth

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%
communicates with the
odontoblasts inside the tooth

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:84%
through electrostatic
mechanisms.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And what you actually
get is you get overwhelm

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
of the odontoblasts,
which are very sensitive,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and they die first.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And then when there
is no defense, when

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.570 align:middle line:84%
there is no kind of metabolic
shields defending the tooth,

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
then the bacteria can
come into the tooth.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And work
done by Ralph Steinman

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
showed that there were
actually fluid flows in health.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.320 align:middle line:84%
There's fluid flows
out through the dentin

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:90%
out through the enamel.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's shown this by
injecting radioactive substances

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
into rats' stomachs
and things like that.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.205 align:middle line:84%
And they'll appear
on the surface

00:18:17.205 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:90%
of the enamel within an hour.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.811 align:middle line:84%
So there's an active circulation
out through the tooth.

00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:84%
That is actually casting off
bacteria, protecting the tooth,

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:84%
protecting it from decay,
protecting it from gum disease.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
In ill health-- and the
decay is just an early sign

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:84%
of ill health-- the
fluid flows reverse.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And everything gets
sucked into the tooth

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and the tooth can no
longer defend itself.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
alternative theory,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:84%
so say which is the
proteolysis and chelation.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is highly
individual in another way

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
as well in that some
bodies seem to be

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
almost immune to
any kind of decay.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Some families, no one in
the family has had a cavity.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Which, our family
was the opposite.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:84%
By the time we were five
years old, all of us

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:90%
were in the dental chair.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And is that a difference
in our blood chemistry

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.805 align:middle line:90%
then that's going on?

00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:16.721 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's hard to
know whether what you're

00:19:16.721 --> 00:19:22.270 align:middle line:84%
looking at there is
dietary or genetics.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
When you look back there
was-- and perhaps you'll

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:84%
come to this-- but
there was a researcher

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:84%
called Weston Price,
Dr. Weston Price.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.283 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are going to
get to that, definitely.

00:19:29.283 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: He's a dentist.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And he did a huge
amount of research.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:84%
But he did a lot of research on
indigenous people in the 1930s.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And he found practically no
decay or gum disease at all

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.861 align:middle line:90%
in these people.

00:19:42.861 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And let's not forget, they had
no toothbrush, no toothpaste.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:90%
They weren't flossing.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:90%
They'd never seen a dentist.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
They had no access
to any of this stuff.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they were going
through their entire lives

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
with straight,
white, healthy teeth.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:90%
No gum disease.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:84%
They were reproducing
children who

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:84%
would accommodate all
their teeth just fine.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.930 align:middle line:90%
So we've come badly off track.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And what he showed was the
effect of the Western diet

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
was catastrophic.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And the pictures are really
quite hard to countenance.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, when
a Western diet

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.542 align:middle line:84%
was introduced to
indigenous cultures.

00:20:17.542 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:90%
It was really quite terrible.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Just devastating.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Gum disease, tooth decay.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So none of these
things are normal.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:84%
We've come think to think
of them as being normal,

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:84%
but they're really
not our native state.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I remember
reading in your more recent

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
online book.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You were stating that suicides
within this indigenous culture

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
that he was specifically
looking at were almost 100%

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:90%
dental related.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
They'd never had that
kind of pain before.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And if they did not have
somebody passing through who

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
could help them
with it, with now

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
the need for modern
dentistry, people

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.745 align:middle line:84%
would actually kill
themselves over the tooth

00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:90%
pain and infection.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Pitiful pictures of
children with bandaged faces

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.811 align:middle line:84%
and people with
draining and infections

00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:90%
coming out through their neck.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All introduced because
of the refined Western diet

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:84%
which was high in sugars,
high in carbohydrates.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would assume prior to
that, their diets natively

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:84%
were high in a lot of
plants, for example,

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and also some proteins
from whatever animals

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:90%
were in the region?

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yeah, so he went
to all sorts of places.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:84%
He went to Labrador, Melanesia,
and the Outer Hebrides

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
in Scotland and the
Lotschental Valley

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
in Switzerland and
Africa and Australia.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:90%
So a huge disparity.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.105 align:middle line:84%
But what he found
was that-- and he

00:21:35.105 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:84%
was trying to look
for the common things

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that united all these
people-- and what he found

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
was that they all
ate fresh foods.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.575 align:middle line:84%
They all, without exception,
ate animal foods as well.

00:21:46.575 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And organ meats, fish.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fresh dairy.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.627 align:middle line:90%
Unadulterated dairies and fats.

00:21:50.627 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Some of them did.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Some of them didn't.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.861 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot more
fat in the diet, yes.

00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
things as well.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But he did actually
specifically look

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
for vegetarian, exclusively
vegetarian tribes.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And there were some he found
that ate a lot of vegetables.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
But even then, they
went to a lot of trouble

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
to get some crab from
neighboring tribes or whatever,

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
supplement with
something like that.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So he actually took samples,
took them back home,

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
analyzed them, and found that
the-- and this is compared

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:84%
to the diet in the
1930s, all right?

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is not
compared to the diet

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:84%
now-- that there was 10 times
the fat, soluble vitamins

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:84%
in their diet that there was in
the 1930s in the Western diet

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and four times as many
water soluble vitamins.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And that the fat soluble
vitamins were crucial,

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
particularly one he called
Activator X, which they now

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:84%
think is vitamin K2, was
essential for the utilization

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:90%
of minerals in the body.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.354 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.354 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what you're
saying, I mean, there

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
is a move toward on
one hand-- I mean,

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
everybody's going
into the various niche

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:90%
diets that are available.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But the whole paleo
diet, which is

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
a return to kind of
meat and vegetables,

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
more or less, that's one
popular one coming up.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And would you say
that that more closely

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.280 align:middle line:84%
resembled what he was finding
out in the field compared

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.360 align:middle line:84%
to-- obviously we
have all raw diets.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:90%
We have vegetarian.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I was a vegetarian
for 20 years myself

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:84%
until I started having
some health issues.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these going
on, is that paleo diet

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:90%
the closest to?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I think so, yes.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.387 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was vegetarian
too for quite a long time.

00:23:27.387 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I look back now
and think that was

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.323 align:middle line:90%
a big part of the problem.

00:23:30.323 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Also I think some of this may
be a red herring in that if you

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:84%
look at kirlian photographs of
food, what these people were

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.262 align:middle line:90%
eating was fresh.

00:23:45.262 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was alive.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Fresh, living food.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So almost irrespective
of what the food was.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It had been harvested
that day, you know?

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.296 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
wonder what that

00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:57.204 align:middle line:84%
would mean for more
of a raw diet then?

00:23:57.204 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people are moving

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:90%
toward raw diets in general.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Usually that means
vegetarianism.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes not.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Some people are eating steak
tartare and raw fish, ceviche

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.905 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember
the name of that right

00:24:10.905 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:90%
off hand, what it's called.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, all
raw foods including

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:84%
the animal kingdom,
and raw dairy.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Cream for example.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.244 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it looked a little
more like that in some ways.

00:24:21.244 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Very much so.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And his recommendations were
organ meats, meat, fish, eggs,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:84%
cod liver oil, high
vitamin butter,

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.240 align:middle line:90%
which is very yellow butter.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
It's butter that's
been made from cows

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:84%
that have been fed on
actively growing pastures.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Grass fed.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Which exists.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:90%
You can buy it.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.223 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:24:44.223 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:90%
No refined anything, really.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:84%
He did actually go
with wheat, but it

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:90%
had to be freshly milled.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:90%
No alcohol.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.769 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:54.769 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a shame
for down at the pub now,

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:90%
isn't it here?

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.956 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then also,
let's talk about Britain.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.884 align:middle line:84%
And America is not
that different.

00:25:03.884 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
You're talking
about toast and tea

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:84%
for breakfast, or toast
and coffee, as it were.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And in America you run by
Starbucks and pick up a pastry

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and a venti latte
where you're talking

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
about milk and maybe two
or three shots of espresso

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and then a muffin to
go, all wheat based.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I think if you look back
at evolutionary biology,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors--
Australopithecus has been around

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.859 align:middle line:90%
for four million years.

00:25:30.859 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that Weston Price did

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:84%
was he looked at the
archaeological records.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And you just see, he just
didn't find any traces

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:84%
of tooth crowding, decay,
gum disease, et cetera.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Generation on generation
on generation,

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.530 align:middle line:90%
they'd reproduced beautifully.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking
at-- homo sapiens

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
has been around
for 200,000 years.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Dairy and grains were introduced
about 10,000 years ago.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So really I think it's 330
generations or something

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:84%
like that, which just
isn't that long ago.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And the effects he
was showing, I mean,

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:84%
these were really
devitalized food.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Which is partly why, in
order to transport things

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
to the colonies and
that sort of thing,

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.975 align:middle line:84%
they needed to keep the
flour free of weevils.

00:26:18.975 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So you think, well, if the
weevils didn't want to eat it,

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:84%
if they didn't perceive
it as being food,

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it was no good
for the humans either.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But what was he found was there
was gross distortions in growth

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:90%
once the Western diet arrived.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jaws.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.949 align:middle line:90%
Malformed jaws.

00:26:34.949 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Really malformed jaws.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.034 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are a freak show
unfortunately in the West.

00:26:39.034 --> 00:26:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it really
shouldn't be that way.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
Weston Price photographs

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
of these various
indigenous cultures,

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:84%
you see these beautiful,
gleaming, full mouths

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.710 align:middle line:90%
of white teeth.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.270 align:middle line:90%
So we've got several problems.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.899 align:middle line:84%
One is that what he found was
that particularly the mid third

00:26:59.899 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:90%
of the face was affected.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So the upper jaw didn't
develop as it should.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And really the whole
upper and lower jaw

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.510 align:middle line:84%
should develop as a complex,
as a dentoalveolar complex.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And it should all kind of grow
together and mesh together.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that when
the contact between the two

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
systems, the upper and
lower jaw are lost,

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
you get all sorts
of malformations.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.252 align:middle line:84%
The tongue drops
out of the palate

00:27:27.252 --> 00:27:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't push
the teeth sideways

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:84%
so you get growth in length in
the face rather than in width.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.255 align:middle line:90%
Typically we get crowding.

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people get
crowding, for which

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
they need to have
some teeth extracted

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:90%
and have orthodontics.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And then later they may need
to have their wisdom teeth out.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You also get other
things like the rib cages

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:90%
weren't fully developing.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:84%
The pelvis wasn't
fully developing

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
so that was having
implications for childbirth.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.567 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot
of evidence that when

00:27:56.567 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:84%
the agriculture was introduced,
that the neonatal death

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:90%
rate just went through the roof.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of the
malformation of the pelvis?

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: That's the
supposition, yes.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I find it
absolutely fascinating.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
This journey of
the mouth is really

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.350 align:middle line:84%
taking us through our own
kind of biological history

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and the distortion of it
through modern agriculture.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.101 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I think a lot of people
make it awfully complicated.

00:28:19.101 --> 00:28:21.105 align:middle line:84%
And in my simple
brain, I just have

00:28:21.105 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
to think, well, what we did
for two million years, that

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.524 align:middle line:90%
can't have been that wrong.

00:28:25.524 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
surely we're not

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.570 align:middle line:84%
designed to all have orthodontic
work by the time we're

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.405 align:middle line:90%
12 years old.

00:28:30.405 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely not.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:31.080 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That shouldn't be the
condition of the human species.

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And what we've come
to think of as normal-- gum

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:84%
disease, 80% of us
have gum disease.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.974 align:middle line:84%
98% of us affected
by tooth decay.

00:28:43.974 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's got all sort of
knock on effects as well.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
All of these
things, orthodontics

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.377 align:middle line:84%
as you say, that we come
to think of as normal,

00:28:52.377 --> 00:28:53.210 align:middle line:90%
none of it's normal.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.774 align:middle line:90%
Arthritis, none of this.

00:28:55.774 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
do get into all of these ways

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:84%
in which we try to
fix the problems

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.402 align:middle line:90%
and what those effects are.

00:29:01.402 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a little break.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.568 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
I want to talk to you

00:29:04.568 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:90%
about is, what is normal?

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel
that they should

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:84%
go through the entire lifetime
and have a full set of teeth

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and want them to be as perfect
as they were in their twenties.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.606 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to find
out when we come back,

00:29:15.606 --> 00:29:17.620 align:middle line:90%
is that actually a normal state?

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be back
in just a minute.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So we were just talking about
what is normal with teeth.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
What should we expect as
we go throughout our lives

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and we go through
the process of aging?

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Are we supposed to drop
a few along the way?

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:31.890 align:middle line:90%
How many?

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.407 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
is normal for human beings.

00:29:35.407 --> 00:29:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know what's normal
kind of for cats and dogs,

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:84%
but they're eating a garbage
diet for the most part

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
too of canned foods
and devitalized foods.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So we can't necessarily
look to them

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
who lose their teeth most of the
time if they live into old age

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.323 align:middle line:84%
to see what we're
supposed to be like.

00:29:49.323 --> 00:29:52.104 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what we're
supposed to have going on.

00:29:52.104 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, interesting
you mentioned that,

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:84%
because there was a researcher,
Francis Pottenger, who

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:90%
looked at cats.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at cats
that ate raw meat

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:90%
and unpasteurized milk.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And he compared
them to cats that

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.990 align:middle line:84%
ate cat food and
pasteurized milk, which

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.255 align:middle line:84%
is what most domestic
cats would be given.

00:30:08.255 --> 00:30:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And over a series of
generations, the cats that

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:84%
were on the raw milk
and the raw meat,

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.620 align:middle line:90%
they remained vital and healthy.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And the other ones, generation
on generation deteriorated.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So the second generation
became chronically sick.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:27.856 align:middle line:84%
The third generation
became unable to reproduce.

00:30:27.856 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
seeing in humans,

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
but you see it in
an accelerated form

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I think in cats because they
have a lesser life span.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.280 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's difficult.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.802 align:middle line:84%
Because for people
like you and me,

00:30:38.802 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:84%
we've already been
on the receiving

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:84%
end of a lot of these treatments
and the diet of our youth

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:44.890 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:84%
I think for any parents
out there watching

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.270 align:middle line:84%
or would be parents,
I think if you

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
can plan it right from
the start and get yourself

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.260 align:middle line:84%
cleaned up and sorted out before
you even think about conceiving

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and then eat a really top notch
diet all through pregnancy

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and when the child
is young as well,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.310 align:middle line:84%
really go easy on the
breads and the pastries

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of
thing, the sugar.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Because they will learn,
what's normal will

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.210 align:middle line:84%
be what you feed them
really and certainly

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:90%
until they go to school.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think with
that generation also

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
give them the cod liver
oil and the butter.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.760 align:middle line:84%
You can also use Chlorella
Growth Factor in children

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.259 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:31:25.259 --> 00:31:27.122 align:middle line:84%
That helps their jaws
to develop and seems

00:31:27.122 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:84%
to provide some
protection against some--

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
that called again?

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.534 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Chlorella
Growth Factor.

00:31:31.534 --> 00:31:32.252 align:middle line:90%
CGF sometimes.

00:31:32.252 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Growth factor, yes.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:33.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:34.443 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:31:34.443 --> 00:31:36.481 align:middle line:84%
So I would really
keep up with that.

00:31:36.481 --> 00:31:38.605 align:middle line:84%
You also need to work on
the tooth brushing and all

00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:39.729 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing as well.

00:31:39.729 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:90%
But let's say now, here we are.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.100 align:middle line:84%
We've been through the typical
Western diet of our youth

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and we've cleaned it up here
and there along the way.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:90%
What should we normally expect?

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:54.290 align:middle line:84%
If let's say we are on,
we've been on a proper diet--

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:84%
in fact, let's go to
the indigenous cultures.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you do see people
in indigenous cultures

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.112 align:middle line:90%
without teeth.

00:32:01.112 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though all
of them have their teeth

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:90%
right in through their old age.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So what is normal to
have happen to our mouths

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.420 align:middle line:84%
as we age if we're eating
properly and feeding ourselves

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:13.920 align:middle line:90%
properly?

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.711 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Well, yes.

00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:17.734 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Weston Price
didn't document that when

00:32:17.734 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:84%
he went to these indigenous
tribes that really

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.840 align:middle line:84%
had no contact with the
Western diet at all.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And he took tens of
thousands of slides.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Just a really
meticulous researcher.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I think those people
that you're talking about

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.130 align:middle line:84%
have probably had some
contact with the West,

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:39.830 align:middle line:84%
otherwise we probably wouldn't
have encountered them much.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It's also hard, as I say, there
was all the skeletal records

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and things where he was,
just generation on generation

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.464 align:middle line:84%
of these beautifully
reproduced skulls and jaws.

00:32:49.464 --> 00:32:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to know what
age those people died at.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So they may not have
lived to the great old age

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that we're living to.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:56.455 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:32:56.455 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:84%
They could have looked to be
80 when they were only 50.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So taking that
into consideration,

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:02.770 align:middle line:90%
just sort of a best guess.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is
highly individual.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I know that we have our own
bodies and our own blood

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
environment to
take into account.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But if we were feeding
ourselves properly,

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.740 align:middle line:90%
should we be losing our teeth?

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And what percentage
of teeth would

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:84%
be considered kind
of a normal loss rate

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:84%
by the time we hit our later
years, our senior years,

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.624 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: People tend to look
to the Aborigines and things

00:33:26.624 --> 00:33:28.040 align:middle line:84%
like that, because
they are really

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.360 align:middle line:84%
kind of a prehistoric
culture that's

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:90%
fairly much intact still.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.567 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to
keep their teeth.

00:33:34.567 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Their teeth get very
worn because they

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.108 align:middle line:90%
eat a very gritty diet.

00:33:37.108 --> 00:33:42.340 align:middle line:84%
They're eating insects and bugs
and roots and things like that.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.877 align:middle line:84%
But I see no reason why you
shouldn't keep your teeth.

00:33:44.877 --> 00:33:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
should keep our teeth?

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.543 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: We really should.

00:33:47.543 --> 00:33:51.610 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't be a normal
thing to be losing your teeth.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But then again, what my
generation of dentists

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.914 align:middle line:84%
have been taught is to keep
the teeth at all costs, really.

00:33:56.914 --> 00:33:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part
we're getting into.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.397 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to know
kind of, what's normal?

00:34:02.397 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can't tell what's
normal, because each one of us

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:84%
has had a distorted
diet, virtually

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:90%
everyone watching this.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.489 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people who
are watching this right now,

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.447 align:middle line:84%
some of our audience have
gone to great lengths

00:34:12.447 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:90%
to recover their health.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, they're on
raw diets, paleo diets,

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.620 align:middle line:84%
macrobiotic, vegetarian,
and so forth.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But usually that has come
later in life for many people.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been all
the way through.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.247 align:middle line:84%
So we've encountered
some kind of tooth decay.

00:34:28.247 --> 00:34:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in the
process of trying

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
to fix the damage
that's been done.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:37.684 align:middle line:84%
And there is a wide variety
of options available now,

00:34:37.684 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to go
through some of them.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.480 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's talk
about the smoking gun

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.250 align:middle line:84%
or in this case,
the smoking tooth.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And we need to roll a little bit
of video over this right now.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:84%
And this is showing amalgam
that is offing its gases.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:84%
And talk about what happens
with amalgam in the mouth.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:58.414 align:middle line:84%
And this is the old
mercury fillings.

00:34:58.414 --> 00:35:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, this was a
real turning point for me,

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.350 align:middle line:90%
I have to say.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.444 align:middle line:84%
I did seven years,
I spent seven years

00:35:03.444 --> 00:35:05.860 align:middle line:84%
at dental school, two of the
best dental schools reputedly

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.810 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I actually wanted to
study the effects of amalgam

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:90%
for my master's degree.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't
discouraged, but I just

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.020 align:middle line:84%
received absolutely no feedback
until it got to the point

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.450 align:middle line:84%
where I realized that I had
to choose another topic.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So I believed, really,
what we were told,

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:84%
which is that mercury
is all bound up.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Amalgam fillings, just for those
that don't know, are 50% liquid

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:84%
mercury, 50% other
powdered metals

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
such as copper, tin,
zinc, and silver.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And they're mixed up.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of paste.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:90%
It sets pretty quickly.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:90%
It's inserted into the tooth.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And what the authorities
have always maintained

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:84%
is that mercury isn't a
problem because it's all

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.730 align:middle line:90%
bound up by the other metals.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.140 align:middle line:84%
It forms a complex
and only tiny amounts

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:84%
are released by the
amalgam fillings.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And I went along with that.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw the
smoking tooth video,

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't,
couldn't let that go.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't dispute
what I was seeing.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.830 align:middle line:84%
As for what the
smoking tooth video is,

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a tooth that
was extracted 25 years

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.300 align:middle line:84%
previously with an
amalgam filling.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
done is they've just

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.200 align:middle line:84%
warmed the surface of
the amalgam a little bit

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:84%
by rubbing it with what
you would call an eraser.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which would
be kind of like when

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.680 align:middle line:90%
we're drinking hot liquids?

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.015 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like coffee
or tea in the morning.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.606 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Or you're eating
something hot or whatever.

00:36:27.606 --> 00:36:29.275 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the amalgam's
can get stimulated

00:36:29.275 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:84%
in all sorts of ways, actually
by electromagnetic radiation

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:90%
and chewing.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.622 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of things.

00:36:36.622 --> 00:36:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And what they've done is
they've just photographed it

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:90%
against a phosphorescent screen.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can see mercury
vapor absolutely

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.810 align:middle line:90%
pouring out of this tooth.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is 25 years
after the tooth was extracted?

00:36:46.185 --> 00:36:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably lost
most of its mercury

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:84%
by then, because
they lose about 80%

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.570 align:middle line:84%
of their original mercury
content after 20 years.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So that filling is on the tail
end of its mercury release.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you,
as an example,

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.310 align:middle line:84%
had 13 of these put in your
mouth within three months.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: On attend to
dental school, yeah.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But I had more
fillings than that.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had
more fillings than that.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But you also saw a
precipitous downturn

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.727 align:middle line:84%
in your already failing
health at that point?

00:37:16.727 --> 00:37:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, I did.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:18.701 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:18.701 --> 00:37:20.636 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
some of the problems.

00:37:20.636 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
to stay on this

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.843 align:middle line:84%
too long, because now
they're being replaced

00:37:23.843 --> 00:37:25.820 align:middle line:84%
by composite fillings,
which we will go on to.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But some of the problems that
have occurred historically

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.260 align:middle line:84%
with chronic disease in us
as a result of these mercury

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:90%
fillings.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: When I
first of all accepted

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:84%
that it was a problem in
me, because I was a dentist.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I, as I say,
started to realize

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.750 align:middle line:84%
it was a problem in everyone
whether it's been detected

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other
thing, is it often

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.270 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get picked
up by blood tests,

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:84%
hair tests, urine tests, all
of those sorts of things.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Because it's actually hidden
away in body compartments,

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:84%
hidden away in cell
organelles, et cetera.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does
it tend to hide?

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It adheres
to the mitochondria.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.422 align:middle line:84%
In the cells, for
those who don't know,

00:38:02.422 --> 00:38:04.130 align:middle line:84%
that's actually the
kind of little energy

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:90%
factory in every cell.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.597 align:middle line:90%
And so that's catastrophic.

00:38:07.597 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it devitalizes
your energy production?

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You get
chronic fatigue.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.172 align:middle line:90%
You also can't process things.

00:38:13.172 --> 00:38:15.130 align:middle line:84%
You can build up of toxic
waste in the tissues.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.005 align:middle line:90%
You get fibromyalgia.

00:38:16.005 --> 00:38:18.927 align:middle line:90%


00:38:18.927 --> 00:38:19.760 align:middle line:90%
I've lost track now.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.382 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?

00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
just wanted to know

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:84%
some of the chronic diseases
that have now been attributed

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.759 align:middle line:84%
to the mercury vapors before
we go on to composite fillings.

00:38:27.759 --> 00:38:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Now, I was looking
at something the other day.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And the man who literally
wrote the book on amalgam,

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:90%
it's a 22,000 page tome.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So that gives you some idea
of the complexity of it.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
mercury is it's liquid,

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:45.430 align:middle line:84%
which unlike any other metal,
and it can form a gas, a vapor,

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.570 align:middle line:84%
at body temperature
and pressure.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:48.930 align:middle line:90%
So those are the two things.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.515 align:middle line:84%
It's also second
only to plutonium.

00:38:51.515 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the most toxic
substance known to man.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's in its
elemental form.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.790 align:middle line:84%
When it gets
converted in the body,

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:84%
as it does into other forms,
into its organic forms

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:84%
by bacteria in the gut or
by liver detoxification,

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:84%
it can be 100 to 1000
times more toxic.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
amazing any of us are

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.252 align:middle line:84%
walking around and
functioning at all.

00:39:12.252 --> 00:39:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Exactly.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.419 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a testament
to what the body does.

00:39:17.419 --> 00:39:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is nuclear waste
as far as the body's concerned.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is amazing.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.208 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It just
managed to tuck it away.

00:39:22.208 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But it does accumulate in
the central nervous system.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much convinced that
multiple sclerosis, ALS,

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:84%
the Alzheimer's, dementias--
both of my parents

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.360 align:middle line:84%
have ended up with dementia
at the end of their lives,

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.880 align:middle line:90%
or very much.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.715 align:middle line:90%
There's a big mercury component.

00:39:40.715 --> 00:39:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other
thing about mercury

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
is it's very synergistic
with other toxins as well.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So it can make other toxins
100 times more potent.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.767 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this
real toxic brew.

00:39:50.767 --> 00:39:53.100 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, though, if you
address the mercury, if you

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.710 align:middle line:84%
pull the mercury out,
the body can actually

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.140 align:middle line:84%
sort a lot of the
other stuff out.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.348 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, let's go ahead.

00:39:58.348 --> 00:40:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Because anyone who has
any mercury remaining

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.726 align:middle line:84%
in their mouth
that's listening to

00:40:01.726 --> 00:40:05.250 align:middle line:84%
this probably has been
inspired to do that by now.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
process of having it

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:84%
removed, and then how the
body on a cellular level

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
can start recovering from the
remnants of what has already

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:90%
been left behind.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, the good
news is that it can.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:84%
As long as there is breath
in your body, there's hope.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But it does need to be
managed incredibly carefully

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:29.470 align:middle line:84%
because, as I say, it is
just such potent toxin.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think if it's
not managed carefully,

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.980 align:middle line:84%
it does have the
potential to kill you

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.422 align:middle line:84%
or to make you-- I certainly
know many people who

00:40:36.422 --> 00:40:38.412 align:middle line:84%
have been made a
great deal sicker.

00:40:38.412 --> 00:40:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By having them
removed because you're

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:42.940 align:middle line:84%
disturbing and opening
all this-- yeah?

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, just in the
act of having them removed,

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter how
carefully it's done.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.269 align:middle line:84%
You will get a big extra
bonus dose of mercury.

00:40:50.269 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You will get a
spike in your blood levels

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.390 align:middle line:90%
for several months.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And what they used to think
was that's how long it

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.750 align:middle line:84%
took to be excreted, but
I think that's how long it

00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.600 align:middle line:90%
takes to be stored.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.289 align:middle line:84%
I think mostly it's
just being stored.

00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you need to
find a bio dentist first

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:84%
of all where you have
your oxygen mask on,

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.470 align:middle line:84%
everything's dammed off,
everybody has masks on.

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yep.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.415 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
will take care

00:41:10.415 --> 00:41:14.570 align:middle line:84%
of at least the first burst
of having this stuff removed.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:15.695 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?

00:41:15.695 --> 00:41:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, some people
do it in different ways.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that you
should maybe space them,

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.560 align:middle line:84%
removals, over a period of
months or years or whatever.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.605 align:middle line:84%
Some dentists actually
use intravenous sedation

00:41:26.605 --> 00:41:28.564 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
just get all of it out,

00:41:28.564 --> 00:41:30.229 align:middle line:84%
put temporary fillings
in then come back

00:41:30.229 --> 00:41:32.182 align:middle line:84%
and you can sort the
rest out without all

00:41:32.182 --> 00:41:34.500 align:middle line:84%
the super precautions
and everything.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.000 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.750 align:middle line:90%
You're very right.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:90%
You do need a bio dentist.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Often if you're sick
before you even start,

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.090 align:middle line:84%
it means that all your organs
of excretion and things

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:84%
are just completely
overwhelmed and you

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:84%
need to actually
detoxify significantly

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.480 align:middle line:90%
before you even think about--

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.579 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know you're
really big on Chlorella.

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Chlorella is great.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:90%
It binds the mercury in the gut.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:84%
What I would say is that I
think a lot of naturopaths

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:03.030 align:middle line:84%
are very keen on
intravenous chelation.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.477 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of that would
pull the mercury out

00:42:05.477 --> 00:42:06.310 align:middle line:90%
through the kidneys.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And the kidneys take an awful
lot of punishment from mercury.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:13.515 align:middle line:84%
Within a month of placing
the first amalgam fillings--

00:42:13.515 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
these experiments that have
been done on animals-- kidney

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.850 align:middle line:90%
function's 50%.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.102 align:middle line:90%
So that's one filling.

00:42:19.102 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we don't go
with intravenous chelation,

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to do
it at home by ourselves

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.880 align:middle line:90%
in a way that's more natural.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.462 align:middle line:84%
So we need to start
taking the green,

00:42:29.462 --> 00:42:30.629 align:middle line:90%
the elements like Chlorella.

00:42:30.629 --> 00:42:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Chlorella's the
best of the green.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Better than
Spirulina and the others?

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Spirulina works,
but it's not as effective.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: There's also clays.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:84%
You can use pyrophyllite
clays and bentonite clays.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Again, mercury has
a positive charge

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.279 align:middle line:84%
and the clays all have
a negative charge.

00:42:49.279 --> 00:42:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Same with the Chlorella really.

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:90%
And it just pulls it all out.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And the gut has
a huge-- it's got

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:56.380 align:middle line:84%
two tennis courts
of surface area.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a big area for
absorption of toxins there.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.409 align:middle line:84%
The other issue is that
a lot of the mercury

00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:05.200 align:middle line:84%
actually gets recirculated
within the body.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So it goes into
the bile, it gets

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.680 align:middle line:84%
released into the intestine
and then it gets reabsorbed.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So it just kind of going around
in this little recycling.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you have stuff in the
gut, it's actually binding it up

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's carrying
it out of the body

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.220 align:middle line:84%
rather than letting
it being reabsorbed.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.796 align:middle line:84%
So Chlorella and bentonite
clay are a good place to begin.

00:43:22.796 --> 00:43:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And also, because we
have so many other things

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.110 align:middle line:84%
we need to talk about
before we finish this hour,

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.070 align:middle line:84%
you have detailed this in your
book, "The Natural Recovery

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Plan," and on your website.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So there are
resources you can go

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.137 align:middle line:84%
to get the entire
protocol for this if you

00:43:36.137 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:90%
want to begin the process.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And it is
important to be informed.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:38.830 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go on
to restorative work.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk
about composites.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I assume they're
quite a bit better?

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I would say
broadly speaking, yes.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not mercury
and they're not metal.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's several
problems that amalgam poses.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.780 align:middle line:84%
One is it's a metal,
and all metals

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.540 align:middle line:84%
are galvanically active when
you put them in the mouth.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And amalgam can be
galvanically active

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.967 align:middle line:84%
between the different
elements of the amalgam

00:44:07.967 --> 00:44:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and also with the other
metals in the mouth.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So your partial denture, your
crown, your orthodontic wires.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.180 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.499 align:middle line:90%
Your implants.

00:44:16.499 --> 00:44:17.790 align:middle line:90%
So they're electrically active.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And as we say, they
all lie on meridians.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're firing off
into the meridians.

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:28.355 align:middle line:84%
Also they act as a dam
on the meridian as well.

00:44:28.355 --> 00:44:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
stops that energy

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:33.440 align:middle line:84%
from flowing through the mouth
and the systems as it needs to.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Exactly.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And they corrode.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.070 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
problems with metals.

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.990 align:middle line:90%
So composite isn't metal.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Having said that composite,
for those that don't know,

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.270 align:middle line:84%
is actually made up of
glass beads, aluminum oxide.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So purists say you
shouldn't use it

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.610 align:middle line:90%
because it contains aluminum.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're in a
plastic kind of matrix.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But composite is
by no means ideal.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:58.750 align:middle line:84%
There are issues around
composite as well.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It contains BPA, which is
an estrogenic chemical,

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.985 align:middle line:84%
and there are
concerns around that.

00:45:05.985 --> 00:45:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Mostly the non-filled ones
actually, I have to say.

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.570 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are
used for fish sealants

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:84%
on children and
that sort of thing,

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.660 align:middle line:90%
more so than the fillings.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think on a
scale of horrors

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that composite is definitely
significantly better

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.370 align:middle line:90%
than amalgam.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the best?

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, I think
you need to be tested.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Because what's best is
what's best for you.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.984 align:middle line:84%
And you even need to get
a kinesiologist to test

00:45:30.984 --> 00:45:32.400 align:middle line:84%
or your dentist
should be testing,

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.900 align:middle line:84%
or you can get the
real laboratory test.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what are the
other options after composite?

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.693 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Well, there's ceramics.

00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:40.730 align:middle line:84%
There's also kind of heat cured
plastics and things like that.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Those are made in a laboratory.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you can afford it and
if your dentist has at all

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.440 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that it might
be a good thing to do,

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I think those are probably
the better way to go,

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle line:84%
although there's
more upfront cost.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is that?

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.629 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: What-- sorry?

00:45:54.629 --> 00:45:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What would
be a better way to go?

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Oh, to actually have
laboratory made restorations

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.160 align:middle line:84%
that are actually
cemented into place.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:02.826 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:46:02.826 --> 00:46:04.525 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Either
ceramics or the there

00:46:04.525 --> 00:46:06.164 align:middle line:90%
are some that are heat-cured.

00:46:06.164 --> 00:46:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Zirconium.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.957 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: The zirconium as
well, that's fairly new.

00:46:10.957 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fairly new, yes.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.581 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:46:12.581 --> 00:46:13.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a ceramic.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It's zirconium oxide
and there's a cast,

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and then they have
porcelains put over the top.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.207 align:middle line:84%
So those all seem
to be a lot better,

00:46:22.207 --> 00:46:24.040 align:middle line:84%
because you haven't got
the galvanic issues.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.524 align:middle line:84%
You haven't got the
meridian blockage.

00:46:26.524 --> 00:46:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The other
chemicals that

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.129 align:middle line:84%
are embedded within
the composite?

00:46:30.129 --> 00:46:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's more
aggressive, but is also

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:35.510 align:middle line:84%
is safer, you're
saying, in the long run.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It is quite a bit
more expensive,

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and people need to take
that into consideration.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about what
happens when a tooth goes bad

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and we have an
abscess and we do what

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.110 align:middle line:90%
is commonly called a root canal?

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, root canals.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I described the anatomy
of the tooth before.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And the idea behind
a root canal is

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that you clean out the canals
inside the root of the tooth,

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.260 align:middle line:84%
if the decay has actually
reached the root or a crack

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.200 align:middle line:84%
has reached the pulp, rather,
and the nerve is dying

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.495 align:middle line:90%
or has died.

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is
that you clean out

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:16.820 align:middle line:84%
the dead space or necrotic
tissue within the tooth

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and seal it and fill it all up.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.872 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly
as a dentist, when

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I was working as
a dentist, thought

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:25.917 align:middle line:84%
that if you did your level
best to get the tooth cleaned

00:47:25.917 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:84%
out and filled up,
that the body could

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.835 align:middle line:90%
kind of take care of the rest.

00:47:28.835 --> 00:47:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's certainly what
seems to happen on x-ray,

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's what most
dentists believe happen.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The trouble with root canals
is it's almost impossible

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:38.650 align:middle line:84%
to clean the root
canal system out,

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's never like
they draw it on a diagram.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It's really complex.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.615 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
accessory canals.

00:47:44.615 --> 00:47:46.360 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of lateral canals.

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.280 align:middle line:84%
The canals, there's two
or three maybe in a root

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.360 align:middle line:90%
and they all intercommunicate.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just not possible to clean
the root canal system out.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And they do try.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.430 align:middle line:84%
They use ultrasonics
and flush the thing out

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:03.886 align:middle line:84%
and they seal stuff
in and what have you.

00:48:03.886 --> 00:48:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But number one, that's
just not possible.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But the really big
problem with root canals

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:12.940 align:middle line:84%
is the structure of the dentin,
which we mentioned earlier,

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.500 align:middle line:90%
but it's tubular.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And when the tooth has
died, the odontoblasts,

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:21.310 align:middle line:84%
which were the cells that were
maintaining the dentin, die.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, and
when a root filling's done,

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.830 align:middle line:84%
what happens is that you are
actually severing off the blood

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:29.790 align:middle line:84%
supply to the tooth or it
has already been severed.

00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually changing the
conditions inside the tooth,

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and the tooth is
actually anaerobic.

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And under those conditions,
the bacteria actually

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.990 align:middle line:84%
morph into their
anaerobic forms.

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.200 align:middle line:84%
They multiply much
more prolifically

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and they produce really super
noxious toxins, thioethers

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
which are 1,000 times more

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.310 align:middle line:84%
toxic than botulinum
toxin, which

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is the most toxic
biological toxin known.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would
that mean that when

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.580 align:middle line:84%
you have a tooth that has gone
through the root canal process,

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.570 align:middle line:84%
you're more likely to have,
then, bone loss in that area,

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:03.590 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You could
have bone loss.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
might perversely

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:10.072 align:middle line:84%
be a sign that your body
was actually responding

00:49:10.072 --> 00:49:11.280 align:middle line:90%
and that your immune system--

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What would be
the other symptomology

00:49:14.036 --> 00:49:16.020 align:middle line:84%
if not bone loss
around this tooth?

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, there
often is no symptom.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:19.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is that the
whole area around the tooth

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:26.530 align:middle line:84%
is full of these really noxious
bacteria, full of their toxins.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And that as you chew
there's actually

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:32.430 align:middle line:84%
a pumping of all this
stuff into the circulation,

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.430 align:middle line:90%
into the lymphatics.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So there may be no
local symptom at all.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But you may have migraines,
you may have arthritis,

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:45.524 align:middle line:84%
you may have breast cancer, you
may have any number of things.

00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
something that I've

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:49.523 align:middle line:84%
been reading more about lately
is root canals and breast

00:49:49.523 --> 00:49:50.270 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:51.436 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Very big link, yes.

00:49:51.436 --> 00:49:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So how is that linked?

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well,
this link has been

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.760 align:middle line:84%
noticed by a lot of people,
that a lot of people

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.760 align:middle line:84%
who have breast cancer
have got a root canal.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are German
studies also in particular.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: There is, yes.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a doctor
called Thomas Rau who

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.180 align:middle line:84%
runs the Paracelsus
clinic in Switzerland.

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually
a medical doctor,

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.200 align:middle line:84%
but it's a kind of holistic
dental and medical center.

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a big place.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:17.510 align:middle line:84%
They take care of both aspects
for people who are usually

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:20.450 align:middle line:84%
pretty chronically
sick or seriously ill.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And he looked back over the
last 150 cases of breast cancer,

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and he found that
97% of them had all

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:31.664 align:middle line:84%
had a root canal on the meridian
that governs the breast.

00:50:31.664 --> 00:50:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I've been
reading about this.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Huge link.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.433 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is really big.

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:37.265 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:50:37.265 --> 00:50:40.260 align:middle line:90%
The tooth has an abscess.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.260 align:middle line:90%
You can't live with it.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.840 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.900 align:middle line:90%
What would you recommend?

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.305 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
not one size fits all.

00:50:48.305 --> 00:50:49.330 align:middle line:90%
We understand that.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying to
diagnose people from here

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:55.110 align:middle line:84%
through their television screen
or their computer screen.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But generally
speaking, what do you

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.180 align:middle line:84%
do when you have an
abscess in the tooth?

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, Weston
Price did a lot of work.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:03.380 align:middle line:84%
He actually-- it was
rather a sad story--

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:07.670 align:middle line:84%
because he did a root canal
on his only child, Douglas,

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and he died as result
of the root canal

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:11.060 align:middle line:90%
that Weston Price did.

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.005 align:middle line:84%
And that's what launched
him into his investigation

00:51:14.005 --> 00:51:14.630 align:middle line:90%
of this matter.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And he spent 25 years
heading up a 60 man

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:19.260 align:middle line:90%
team looking into this.

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And he produced just
tomes and tomes of work

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.740 align:middle line:84%
on this, which was kind of
buried after his death, really.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.980 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I've lost the--

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.292 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what do we do then?

00:51:33.292 --> 00:51:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: What do we do.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.138 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have a
tooth that screaming.

00:51:36.138 --> 00:51:37.050 align:middle line:90%
It's abscessed.

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:37.894 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: One of
the studies he did

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:42.647 align:middle line:84%
was he took fragments of
the root canal filled tooth

00:51:42.647 --> 00:51:44.730 align:middle line:84%
from people with known
diseases and implanted them

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:45.616 align:middle line:90%
into rabbits.

00:51:45.616 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And he did this a
successive number of times.

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And he found that the
diseases that the person had

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:53.470 align:middle line:84%
were transferable
100% to the animal.

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So that if they'd had kidney
disease or heart disease,

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:58.155 align:middle line:84%
then the rabbit got kidney
disease or heart disease

00:51:58.155 --> 00:51:59.571 align:middle line:84%
and died within a
couple of weeks.

00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:01.150 align:middle line:90%
So there's a very strong link.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.897 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
be more the toxins

00:52:03.897 --> 00:52:06.230 align:middle line:84%
that the bacteria are producing
than the actual bacteria

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:08.300 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:13.990 align:middle line:84%
He also found that some people,
about a quarter of people,

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:17.380 align:middle line:84%
can tolerate root canals or
seem to be able to if they've

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:21.150 align:middle line:84%
got a history of robust
good health in their family,

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:22.690 align:middle line:90%
but only up to a certain point.

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
fine until there's

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:25.830 align:middle line:84%
another stressor
put on the system.

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So you know, a
partner dies or they

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:30.352 align:middle line:90%
lost their job or whatever.

00:52:30.352 --> 00:52:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
that becomes an issue.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:34.185 align:middle line:84%
Their immune system
can't contain it anymore.

00:52:34.185 --> 00:52:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And whatever.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So some people do seem to
be able to live with them.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.422 align:middle line:84%
However, if you've had a
history of degenerative illness

00:52:43.422 --> 00:52:45.130 align:middle line:84%
over the last two
generations, especially

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.880 align:middle line:84%
if it involved the kidneys,
his strong recommendation

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.476 align:middle line:90%
was you got the teeth out.

00:52:50.476 --> 00:52:51.850 align:middle line:84%
There's another
dentist now who's

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:56.920 align:middle line:84%
kind of inherited his work,
Dr. Hal Huggins, who's

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.810 align:middle line:90%
a big anti-amalgam dentist.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And he's done a lot
of laboratory work.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, a
lot of this work

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.300 align:middle line:84%
has been confirmed
by people recently

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:09.420 align:middle line:84%
with modern techniques, so
not just looking back 70 years

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.430 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:12.730 align:middle line:90%
But he's done a lot of work.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know his
strong recommendation

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.240 align:middle line:84%
is that you get root
canal filled teeth out.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.284 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:53:18.284 --> 00:53:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you're down to having

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:24.240 align:middle line:84%
to have bridges,
false teeth, implants.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.441 align:middle line:90%
And so we know about bridges.

00:53:26.441 --> 00:53:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people kind of
understand how that goes.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.814 align:middle line:84%
You have to have teeth on
either side kind of filed down.

00:53:30.814 --> 00:53:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And you put the-- we
used to call them caps--

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.374 align:middle line:84%
but you put the--
what do you call them?

00:53:36.374 --> 00:53:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Bridge.

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, the bridge.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:38.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.575 align:middle line:84%
The two teeth on the side,
and then the one in the middle

00:53:40.575 --> 00:53:42.390 align:middle line:84%
is kind of bridged,
the others holding it.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:43.990 align:middle line:90%
So you do that.

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.510 align:middle line:84%
You can have a partial, have a
whole lot of teeth pulled down

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and a plate that goes up
there and holds the teeth in

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:56.050 align:middle line:84%
or all your teeth out, and have
two plates that are your teeth.

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Or you can have an implant.

00:53:57.490 --> 00:54:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And now implants are
becoming very popular.

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
happens with implants.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I'm wrestling with this
one at the moment, actually.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I should just add
that you don't just

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:09.700 align:middle line:84%
want to get the root filled
tooth just extracted,

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.310 align:middle line:84%
because you're leaving
the membrane and all

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:13.475 align:middle line:90%
the affected bone behind.

00:54:13.475 --> 00:54:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So you need to see
a biological dentist

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and have that looked at,
properly cleaned out.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Intravenous vitamin C, maybe
ozone, all sorts of things,

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.157 align:middle line:84%
homeopathics to make
sure it heals properly.

00:54:24.157 --> 00:54:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's done properly.

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:26.480 align:middle line:90%
The tooth is out.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And we have options.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are gravitating now

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:30.560 align:middle line:90%
to having implants done.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.922 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:54:31.922 --> 00:54:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, the vast
majority of implants

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.600 align:middle line:84%
are made out of titanium, so
you're back on the metals thing

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.100 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And the body does seem to
tolerate them fairly well.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.790 align:middle line:84%
But they also do
produce oxides which

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:84%
we know are found in
the surrounding tissues,

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:50.090 align:middle line:84%
are found in the meridian that
that tooth's on, et cetera.

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So I have got some
root filled teeth

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:53.530 align:middle line:90%
which I'm looking to address.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And I won't be going down
the titanium implant route.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.910 align:middle line:84%
The other issue you're
looking at with implants

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:04.260 align:middle line:84%
is you're implanting
something foreign in the body.

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Number one.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And number two, it's
actually perforating

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the outer protective
surface of the body, really.

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the most
heavily populated part

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:18.580 align:middle line:90%
of the body, the mouth.

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the bacteria there
which actually can get access

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:25.820 align:middle line:84%
to the bone,
directly to the bone

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.780 align:middle line:90%
down the surface of the implant.

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You've also got the fact
that the immune system will

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.400 align:middle line:84%
be trying to defend itself
from this foreign body.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And over time that may
result in autoimmune disease

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:38.760 align:middle line:84%
or chronic fatigue or
something like that,

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.280 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of immune failure,
which results in cancer.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.890 align:middle line:84%
You also got the fact that the
surface, any implanted surface

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:49.380 align:middle line:84%
in the body can act as a surface
for the growth of biofilms.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And now it's thought that
80% of infections in humans

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.520 align:middle line:84%
are actually biofilm
in origin, which

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.510 align:middle line:84%
is where bacteria actually
colonize a surface.

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:02.852 align:middle line:84%
They put up a protective
canopy, if you like.

00:56:02.852 --> 00:56:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they
actually communicate.

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:06.150 align:middle line:90%
So they exchange information.

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:08.040 align:middle line:90%
So you've got a whole little--

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
highly adaptable.

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Highly adaptable.

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:11.551 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Great survival rates.

00:56:11.551 --> 00:56:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Biofilm are survivors.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Exactly.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So you've got all those
things to factor in as well.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.110 align:middle line:84%
There is the alternative
zirconium implants,

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.840 align:middle line:84%
that, again, overcomes a
lot of the metal issues

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.740 align:middle line:84%
to do with galvanism,
electricity, blocking

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.440 align:middle line:90%
the meridians.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.440 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't appear to
block the meridians.

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And some people
tolerate that well.

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I know Hall Huggins, he's
done analysis of the biofilms

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.616 align:middle line:84%
and things on zirconium
implants, and he's not a fan.

00:56:38.616 --> 00:56:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the day, it's
a choice of lesser evils really,

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:43.310 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:44.726 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
the other options

00:56:44.726 --> 00:56:49.729 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned, they're using
metals, plates, and bridges.

00:56:49.729 --> 00:56:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the most ideal, least

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:57.790 align:middle line:84%
disruptive to our
health option then.

00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Say you have two or three
teeth that have to go.

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.107 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:57:04.107 --> 00:57:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Depends where they are.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you can just leave it.

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's say you're
taking out a root canal, teeth

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:13.720 align:middle line:84%
with root canals
included in that.

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So sometimes
leaving the gap is an option

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.270 align:middle line:84%
if the other teeth aren't good
to move around or overerupt,

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.865 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:57:21.865 --> 00:57:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Obviously if you're losing a
central incisor or something

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.490 align:middle line:90%
like that, it's not an option.

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:26.780 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.821 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: For most people.

00:57:27.821 --> 00:57:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I think you need to go and
see somebody who's informed.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:35.070 align:middle line:84%
You need to be
informed yourself.

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:38.122 align:middle line:84%
So read up and find
out about these things.

00:57:38.122 --> 00:57:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And you probably need
to be muscle tested

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:42.630 align:middle line:84%
or to have to some
biocompatibility testing done

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:45.990 align:middle line:84%
for whatever material you're
planning to put in there.

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't want
in metals in my mouth.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:53.000 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I was
hit by a motor bike

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and I got a broken leg
a couple of years ago.

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually just gone
through elective major surgery

00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to get the metal
rod out of my leg

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:02.010 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
metals in my body.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:03.210 align:middle line:90%
I just don't.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one lesson you've
learned out of all of this,

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:10.190 align:middle line:84%
is if there's any way to get
the metals out of your body,

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.990 align:middle line:90%
get them out.

00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.682 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:58:11.682 --> 00:58:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And because the thing is
that the crown in your mouth

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:17.880 align:middle line:84%
is interacting with your
hip prosthesis or your knee.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The metals
are communicating.

00:58:19.505 --> 00:58:20.213 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Exactly.

00:58:20.213 --> 00:58:23.719 align:middle line:84%
You are just a bag of saline
with two metal implants.

00:58:23.719 --> 00:58:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have only a couple
of minutes left here.

00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Just really briefly, the new
type of x-rays, a lot of people

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.010 align:middle line:84%
are afraid of
radiation, justifiably.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:37.310 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening with the
newest kinds of x-ray machines

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:37.870 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, they've
improved massively.

00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.840 align:middle line:90%
They're digital now.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, not in all dental
surgeries, but it's coming in.

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:46.940 align:middle line:84%
They use about a
tenth of the radiation

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.430 align:middle line:90%
of the previous x-rays.

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:54.524 align:middle line:84%
And also the images can be
manipulated on the computer,

00:58:54.524 --> 00:58:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and so you can increase contrast
and color and everything.

00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.236 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
perceive more information.

00:58:59.236 --> 00:59:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're not
as bad as they used to be.

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.607 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They're not as
bad as they used to be.

00:59:03.607 --> 00:59:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But still, it shouldn't
be taken recklessly.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.273 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes or no.

00:59:06.273 --> 00:59:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Fluoride?

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:07.289 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:59:07.289 --> 00:59:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In your toothpaste,
in your drinking water?

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:10.190 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.734 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:59:10.734 --> 00:59:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
have time to go

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:15.030 align:middle line:84%
into that right now,
but a no on that.

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: An absolute no, yes.

00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're just
about out of time.

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But Allison, I can't
thank you enough.

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I think we've all learned
a tremendous amount

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.630 align:middle line:84%
about our teeth
today and how it's

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:25.379 align:middle line:84%
interconnected with
the rest of our health

00:59:25.379 --> 00:59:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and our vital
systems and organs.

00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:29.542 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for taking
the time to come be with us.

00:59:29.542 --> 00:59:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well,
you're most welcome.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And I do hope that this
information gets out there,

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:34.790 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
really crucially

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.550 align:middle line:84%
important, and especially for
the next generation as well.

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Couldn't agree more.

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: For parents making
choices about their children.

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.306 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:59:41.306 --> 00:59:42.414 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: You're welcome.
