>>EDWARD GROUP: Dentists.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
We trust them with the health
of our mouths, and most of us

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:10%
don't even think twice
about following their orders

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:10%
to get common procedures
like cleanings, fillings,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:10%
root canals, and implants done.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Our guest today,
Dr. Blanche Grube,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
studied under and
then worked closely

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Hal Huggins, a true
pioneer of holistic dentistry.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
here, Dr. Blanche.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:10%
>>BLANCHE GRUBE: Thank
you very much, Dr. Ed.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD: You're a
biological dentist.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yes, I am.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: What does that mean?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUBE: Well, a
biological dentist

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:10%
is very concerned
with the materials

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:10%
they put in somebody's
mouth and how

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:10%
it affects their whole body.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How did biological
dentistry save your life?

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I had my first filling,
my first mercury filling

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:90%
at the age of four.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was seven, I
had my first mysterious kidney

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:90%
ailment.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was
in third grade,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:90%
I was put in remedial reading.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I never graduated
from remedial reading.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was
42, I was diagnosed

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
with chronic
myeloblastic leukemia.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
All of these things happened to
me as a result of the dentistry

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I received at a
very, very early age.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Had it not been for biological
dentistry and my meeting Dr.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Hal Huggins and having all of
the toxic materials removed

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:84%
from my mouth, including 18
mercury fillings and five root

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
canal teeth, I would
not be alive here today,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.723 align:middle line:90%
sitting and talking to you.

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well,
thank god you are.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.328 align:middle line:84%
Take us back to that first
lecture with Dr. Huggins,

00:01:57.328 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
or the first time that
you met Dr. Huggins.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.382 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUBE: Well, I went
to Colorado Springs

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:10%
for my first class
on mercury toxicity.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Walked into the classroom.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:90%
It was held at a hotel.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a very famous
hotel in Colorado Springs.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Walked into the
classroom, and the nurse

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
immediately sat me down and
put a tourniquet on my arm.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, excuse
me, what's this for?

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, Dr. Huggins
wants a sample of blood

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
from every dentist that
walks into this classroom.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:90%
There were 60 of us.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I was the only female.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, OK.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:90%
I'll have a blood test done.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And they drew some
blood from my arm.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Huggins then spent
the first three days

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
talking about mercury,
mercury, mercury.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
On the fourth day, he announces
that our blood tests had

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
come back from Colorado
Springs General Hospital,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.832 align:middle line:84%
and he was going to show us
just how sick we all were.

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Because of course,
this was a class

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
of 60 dentists
exposed to mercury

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:90%
every single day of their life.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, the blood tests came back.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Mine was the first one
that went up on the wall.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, ooh, we've
got a sick puppy here.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Whose blood is this?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting at
the edge of the row.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of hesitantly
raised my hand and said,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:90%
it's my blood.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh OK.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
He said, so tell me, how
long have you had cancer?

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:90%
What a shock.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me?

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.437 align:middle line:90%
Where do you see that?

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, they
circled it in red.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:84%
They circled it in red with
a magic marker several times.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't
understand what it meant.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I looked and I said, well,
it says 1% meta cells.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Hal Huggins asked me, you
don't know much about leukemia,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.430 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.680 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I didn't even
know what meta cell was.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, that's
an abbreviation

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.663 align:middle line:90%
for myeloblastic cell.

00:04:01.663 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Wait, and that
was the first time you ever

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:90%
found out that you had cancer?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That is correct.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Wow.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.682 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And my answer to
him, because I'm always

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
a total optimist, I said,
well, 1% is a small number.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And his response was,
yes, 1% you're sick.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:90%
2% you're in the hospital.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And 3% you're dead.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty shocking.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a class
of 60 other dentists,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and I just received
my diagnosis of having

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:90%
myeloblastic leukemia.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.338 align:middle line:84%
The very next question that
Dr. Hal Huggins asked me--

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
now remember, we've
been just talking

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:90%
about mercury for three days--

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
the next question he
said was, so Dr. Blanche,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
just how many root canals
do you have in your head?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm thinking,
I just met this man.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I hardly know him.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.470 align:middle line:90%
He hardly knows me.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
How does he know I have
root canals in my head?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.610 align:middle line:90%
So I answered him.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:90%
I said, I have five.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:90%
He says, very good.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
He says, you're going to get
them taken out, aren't you?

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm a New Yorker.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Hell, no!

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting my
teeth taken out.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm very proud of the
fact that I'm a dentist.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm very proud of the
fact that I have 32 teeth.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I plan on going to my
grave with 32 teeth.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Hal Huggins looked me straighten
the face and said, yep.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
you're doing, sooner

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:90%
rather than later.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And he turned around
and walked away.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was--

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I was in a daze.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to think.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sure.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Had I just been insulted or not?

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I really wasn't sure.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
That was my introduction
to biological dentistry.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, I had
to make the decision about

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:84%
whether or not I
was going to have

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
all of my fillings removed and
all of my root canal teeth.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I sympathize with
my patients when

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:84%
they say, no, I don't want
to have any teeth taken out.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:90%
I agree with them.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to have any
teeth taken out either.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But I had three children,
two cats, a dental office,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:90%
a husband.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.935 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I wanted to live.

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how
long did it take

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
you to make that
decision to do something

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:90%
for your own dental health?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: It actually
took me four months.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It actually took me four months
to have my dental revision.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It took me one more month
to make the decision,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:84%
because the next
month, Dr. Huggins

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:90%
gave the advanced course.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought
the advanced course

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
was going to teach us what
we can put in the mouth.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Since the first
course taught us how

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to take mercury
fillings out properly,

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
the second course must teach
us what to put in properly.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a safe assumption.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
The second course was
all about root canals.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I learned about
the toxicity of root canals

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and how the body has such
a difficult time dealing

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:84%
with the toxicity
of root canals,

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that's when I understood that I
had to have my five root canal

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.655 align:middle line:90%
teeth taken out.

00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well,
how many fillings

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:90%
did you say you had as well?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: 18.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: 18?

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yeah.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I had my first filling
when I was four years old.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Wow.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I was
just a little kid.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:84%
In Brooklyn, New York, every
corner has a candy store.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what
happened first?

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
You went to Dr.
Huggins, and then was it

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:90%
a certain system that it is.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to get your
root canals taken out.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.010 align:middle line:84%
That was a huge
decision that you

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:84%
had to make, as well as
getting your fillings taken out

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:90%
as well, correct?

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And I had
to save up for it.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't given to me for free.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's the other reason
why it took some time.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.977 align:middle line:90%
It took a few months.

00:07:27.977 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Was there something
that finally convinced you

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that took place in your head
to say, OK, I'm doing this now,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting these taken out?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: The science.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the kind of
chemicals that come out

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
of a root canal tooth and how
the body cannot deal with those

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:84%
chemicals, that was what
convinced me that this was

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
something that had to be done.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.285 align:middle line:90%
And it's the chemicals.

00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And the chemicals, the
names of the chemicals

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.535 align:middle line:84%
that come out of
root canal teeth

00:07:53.535 --> 00:07:56.268 align:middle line:84%
is not something that's
widely known amongst dentists.

00:07:56.268 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how
long did it actually

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
take to remove all the root
canals and all the fillings?

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I was in what
they called at that time

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
the Huggins Diagnostic
Center in Colorado Springs.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:90%
That's where he had his clinic.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I was there a total
of three weeks.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I began having my
mercury fillings

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:90%
removed the first week.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Now I call those the old days.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, it was
used to be done in sections.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
We did not have conscious
sedation back then,

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:90%
so it was done in sections.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Some days I was a patient.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.148 align:middle line:84%
Some days I was a student
and I would study with Hal.

00:08:26.148 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So the
fillings were first.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.898 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Fillings were first.

00:08:28.898 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
And when my first group
of fillings came out,

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
the droning that I had in the
back of my head from the time

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I was four years old
disappeared overnight.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, I woke up
in Colorado Springs at 5:00

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and I
had a silence in my head

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that I had never
experienced before.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I grabbed a magazine
and I could read

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in my life.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I had taken the Evelyn
Wood Reading course twice

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
in my life, so I knew
how to move my finger.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.600 align:middle line:90%
I just had no comprehension.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
This time, I grabbed a
magazine, moved my finger,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and I could read, and I could
understand what I was reading.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I was so excited that day, I
could not wait for Dr. Huggins

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
to show up in the
clinic that morning.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:90%
I went running up to him.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, Dr. Huggins, I
have to tell you something.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:90%
He said, what's that, Blanche?

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, I can read.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:90%
And he thought I was crazy.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.083 align:middle line:90%
He said, of course you can read.

00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:32.883 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, no.

00:09:32.883 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:90%
You don't understand.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't read before.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Now I can.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I was in remedial reading
class from third grade

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:84%
all the way through,
and I can read now.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't care if
the cancer doesn't go away.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to spend the last
two months of my life reading

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:90%
as much as I can.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Dr. Huggins
said, don't be silly, Blanche.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:84%
The cancer's going
to go away too.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And he was right.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:84%
After the root canal
teeth were taken out--

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Wait, so you would
attribute the fact that you

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
had this reading difficulty
to mercury poisoning, correct?

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Absolutely.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: OK.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: As a child, I
didn't have any root canals.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Right.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: But I did
have the droning.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The droning in the
back of my head

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
was similar to the sound you
hear when you walk into a room

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and there's fluorescent
lights above you.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
That background
noise, that's what

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:90%
I had in my head my whole life.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.715 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: So that's a miracle.

00:10:24.715 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:84%
That was a miracle
that happened.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Exactly.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was happy
with one miracle.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: [LAUGHS]

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I was absolutely
happy with one miracle.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And then you moved
on to your root canals.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.958 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Then they moved
on to the root canals.

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's the order even today.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Mercury fillings come out
first, then root canals.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
When the root canals came
out, the myeloblastic cells

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And I often tell people,
yes, it took a little longer.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's because
the root canals

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:10%
were taken out at the end,
at the end of the third week.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my
myeloblastic cells disappeared.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I continued doing blood
tests every month,

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.952 align:middle line:90%
because I was nervous about it.

00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I would do a blood
test every month

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to make sure there was
no myeloblastic cells.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Then every two months,
then every three months,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:90%
then once a year.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So your
cancer went away--

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.167 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Cancer went
away in three weeks.

00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And you didn't go to
an oncologist during that time.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Oh, no.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:84%
As my husband--
as a chiropractor,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
we always consider ourselves
to be a holistic family.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:90%
We took lots of supplements.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:90%
We ate well.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.760 align:middle line:84%
We didn't go to
physicians unless we

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:90%
were down on the floor dying.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So when my cancer
disappeared and I

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:84%
was cleared from
leukemia, that is

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
when I made the decision
that I was going

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:90%
to follow Dr. Hal Huggins.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say what
he said, do what he did,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and read everything
that he read.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.148 align:middle line:84%
And I did that for
the next 28 years.

00:11:44.148 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: That's amazing.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:90%
That takes us to Hal Huggins.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Blanche had the opportunity
to interview Dr. Huggins

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:90%
a year before he died in 2014.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.728 align:middle line:10%
>>HAL HUGGINS: And that's what
my life is totally dedicated

00:11:57.728 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:10%
to right now, is informing
the public that I do not

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:10%
feel it's proper.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:10%
30 million root canals means
30 million infected teeth

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:10%
out there, because
even though they

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:10%
say they sterilize
the teeth, from DNA,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:10%
we have found 100% are
contaminated with some

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:10%
of the world's worst
pathogens, which are bacteria

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:10%
that create pathology, disease.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking about
multiple sclerosis.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:10%
We're talking Lou Gehrig's
disease, leukemia,

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:10%
Parkinson's, Alzheimer's.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:10%
There's several others
in here that are all

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:10%
classified as
autoimmune diseases that

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:10%
have their origin in either
mercury, the toxins from root

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:10%
canals, or when
they get together

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.943 align:middle line:10%
they play off of each other.

00:12:53.943 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Dr.
Huggins seems pretty

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:90%
passionate about what he did.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
What was that
internal passion he

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
had that he wanted to share
his work with everybody?

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Dr. Huggins
was a lover of people.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:10%
When somebody would
explain how much suffering

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:10%
they had to go through and
what kind of symptoms they had,

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:10%
you could see his eyes
well up with tears.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:84%
He truly felt everything that
his patients went through.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
He was a lover of
people, and so am I.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
My job is to let the
world know, there's

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
a different kind of dentistry
that they can have out there,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:90%
and they need to know that.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So Dr. Blanche,
where do things stand today?

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
What's the official narrative
on mercury fillings?

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: There really is
no official narrative,

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:84%
because it varies
from state to state.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Some states are very lenient
towards holistic, biological

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
dentists, and some states
are still very strict.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And if the dentist
uses the word--

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
the m word, what we
call the mercury word,

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
they could have their
licenses revoked

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:90%
for non-ethical behavior.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there's some
states-- fortunately,

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I live in one of the states
that is somewhat liberal

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and allows us to discuss mercury
removal for our patients.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what would
you say about the state

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:90%
of conventional dentistry today?

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: The majority
of dental offices

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
are doing procedures that
the dentist wants to do,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily procedures
that the patients must have.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Very often, the dentist will
use the words, you need.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Those two words.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:90%
You need to have a root canal.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:90%
You need to have an implant.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You need to have
some fillings done.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:90%
And the patients believe them.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, need is a funny word.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.725 align:middle line:90%
Need is a funny word.

00:14:43.725 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:90%
There are other parts to need.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.448 align:middle line:90%
Well, what are our alternatives?

00:14:50.448 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
dentists, unfortunately,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that don't discuss the
alternatives with patients,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
because they want to give the
patient the procedure that they

00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:90%
want to do.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
When I went to school, I was
taught right from day one

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to be a
doctor of the head and neck.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was so proud of that.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I remember sitting up
straight and tall in my chair.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.903 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm going to be a
doctor of the head and neck.

00:15:12.903 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And right after
that lecture, they

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
proceeded to teach us how
to be carpenters of teeth.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's still that way today.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:90%
I hear it every single day.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I hear patients call
me and say to me,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:84%
the dentist said I
need to have this.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:90%
And I ask a simple question.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, do you want to have that?

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Let's go back to
your story with Dr. Huggins.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I know you started
studying underneath him.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
How did you go from
student to colleague?

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, after
my cancer disappeared,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I made the decision
to follow Dr. Huggins.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I continued studying with him.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.338 align:middle line:84%
I took many advanced
courses with him.

00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And then little by
little, he started

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
asking me if I would be
interested in teaching part

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of it, because I was one of
the few dentists that was truly

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:90%
following the Huggins protocol.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Even to this day, I'm
the strictest one.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I follow the Huggins
protocol to the T.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
teaching his courses.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And then before you know it,
as he began to get older,

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
then I started teaching
the whole course.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And so then little by little,
we started working together.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And you
never stop learning.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: I never stop learning.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Every day, I learn.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How did
working with him

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:84%
change your perception
of dentistry?

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, Dr. Huggins
was a man who was probably

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:90%
100 years before his time.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
He was a true genius.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:84%
He was one of those
people probably

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
like Einstein who only needed
to sleep four hours a night.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually lived
two lives to our one.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.953 align:middle line:84%
So he would always come up
with these phenomenal ideas.

00:16:45.953 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And then when he would
follow through with the ideas

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and we would check
out the research,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
we would discover that he
was right, even before he

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:90%
had his hands on the research.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything that he talked
about, he was right.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.912 align:middle line:90%
He absolutely amazed me.

00:16:59.912 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What was
his big message?

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Because he talks a
lot about systemic.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about dentistry

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is focused just on
the head and neck,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:84%
but shouldn't it
really be a systemic--

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Absolutely.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
The mouth is connected
to the rest of the body,

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
you put in your mouth

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.157 align:middle line:90%
affects your whole body.

00:17:20.157 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've
heard the expression,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:90%
you are what you eat.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:90%
And many people say, oh, yeah.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I get that.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I know that I have
to eat well in order

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
to make good heart muscle and
good muscles and good organs.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.463 align:middle line:90%
I know I have to eat well.

00:17:34.463 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first
thing you're eating

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:84%
are the filling
materials in your mouth.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
you're sucking on

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
are the materials the
dentist puts in your mouth.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
make that connection.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you are what you eat.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you continually
eat toxic materials,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.662 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a body
full of toxic materials.

00:17:54.662 --> 00:17:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: That's right.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I hope not only dentists watch
this and learn from this,

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
but the general public
as well so they can

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:90%
help educate their dentists.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: In Dr.
Blanche's interview

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Huggins just
before his passing,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.377 align:middle line:84%
he made a very
important announcement.

00:18:11.377 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HUGGINS: Hi.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dr. Hal Huggins, one of
the pioneers in finding out

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:84%
what's wrong with mercury
fillings and root canals.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the people who
are following in my footsteps--

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I've got pretty good-sized
feet, and one person

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
who seems to be able
to fill those shoes

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:90%
is Dr. Blanche Grube.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And she has taken
this technology

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and studied it and
refined it to the point

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that by now, she has
surpassed my abilities of what

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:90%
I can do there.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very happy to be able
to pass the baton to Dr. Blanche

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Grube to carry on and honor
the statement that we both made

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
when we graduated about
first, do no harm.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But second, reverse the
harm that's been done.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:90%
So Blanche, here's the torch.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Let it keep you warm.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Let it save millions of lives
through not only your word,

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
but from your passing
junior torches

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:84%
on to other people
whose interest is

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
in developing dentistry into the
true concept of oral medicine.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Oral medicine is where you
combine the two, dentistry

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:90%
and medicine, where they meet.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you can use
both technologies,

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:84%
then you can turn around much
of the incurable disease.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Wow.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.833 align:middle line:90%
That was emotional.

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: That was
very emotional for me.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I have a hard time watching
that without choking.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How does
that make you feel?

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Very proud.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Sad that he's gone, but
proud at the same time

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that I have been able
to fill his shoes.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And doing the best
I possibly can.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I also have now several
dentists underneath me

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
who I'm mentoring
on a daily basis.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you are
carrying on his work

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and improving things and
teaching as many people

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:90%
as you can.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about Dr. Huggins'
first book, "All in Your Head."

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Oh, boy.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:90%
That book came out in 1984.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And when that book
came out, it literally

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:84%
turned the dental
world upside down.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the American
Dental Association,

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think all
the dental societies,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think all the
dentists knew this was coming.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:90%
They were blindsided by it.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote this
book, and the book

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is full of scientific
references, which unfortunately

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.428 align:middle line:84%
to this day, some dentists
refuse to look at.

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So it
wasn't well received.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.387 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: It was
not well received.

00:21:05.387 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
Dr. Huggins really

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
thought that he was
going to get the Nobel

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Prize for writing this book.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he got the proverbial
kick in the butt for it.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That's
really what happened.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:10%
And right now,
I'm in the process

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.242 align:middle line:10%
of rewriting the book, because
there have been some changes.

00:21:22.242 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD: So it was
the Huggins protocol.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Now it's the
Huggins-Grube protocol.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain the changes
that have taken place?

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yes.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the biggest
changes that has taken place

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
was that conscious sedation
was introduced into dentistry

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:90%
for the general practitioner.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Prior to this time,
only an anesthesiologist

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:84%
could put somebody in
what they call sleepy land

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:90%
or in a sedated state.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Only an anesthesiologist
could do that.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the law was
changed and dentists

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:84%
started taking
courses on anesthesia,

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Huggins and I discovered
that if a patient is

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
in a sedated state, you could
do a lot more dentistry.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
They would wake up
feeling refreshed,

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:84%
as if they'd just taken
a 15-minute nap, when

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
in fact they'd been in the
chair for several hours.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And now we could remove
all of the mercury fillings

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:90%
in one day.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:90%
That was the biggest change.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Another big change
took place when--

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:90%
I continued my studying.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Even after I had learned
all that I could possibly

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:84%
learn from Dr. Hal
Huggins, I went on

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to Capital University
of Integrative Medicine

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and after two years
received a doctorate

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:90%
in integrative medicine.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, that curriculum taught
me all about homeopathy.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.915 align:middle line:84%
So I incorporated homeopathy
into the protocol.

00:22:40.915 --> 00:22:44.360 align:middle line:84%
That curriculum taught
me about acupuncture,

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:84%
so I incorporated acupuncture
into the protocol.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So there were things that
were added beyond what

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Huggins had first said.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
That's what he meant when he
said she's added more to it.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And it has actually
made the protocol

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot safer and a lot more
pleasurable for the patient.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember when--

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
when would be the
last time that I'd

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:84%
given somebody a prescription
for a narcotic drug for pain?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Maybe five years.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 10 years ago.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we give our patients
homeopathic remedies.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.580 align:middle line:90%
They're so much safer.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:90%
They're so much more effective.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the way to go.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
some of the changes.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.330 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
many changes that we've

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:90%
added to the protocol.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
teach dentists now,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:90%
it's a much bigger protocol.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot more to learn.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Right.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:90%
So much more natural too.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:90%
So much more natural.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How supported is
the Huggins-Grube protocol

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
with scientific research or
anecdotal research or evidence?

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Everything that we
do has scientific research

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:90%
to back it up.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Every single thing that we do.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How supported
today versus years ago

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is the Huggins-Grube protocol
by modern-day dentists?

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.755 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Unfortunately,
I don't think

00:24:01.755 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
they agree with us at
all, because again, they

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.072 align:middle line:84%
don't want to change
the way they practice.

00:24:07.072 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Do they not
want to read the results,

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:90%
read the science?

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: No.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Dentists-- you
know, this was first

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
told to me when I was
working as a dental assistant

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and thinking of
becoming a dentist.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.563 align:middle line:84%
The dentist who
was encouraging me

00:24:20.563 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
said, Blanche, you
need to be a dentist.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You can't just stay
as a dental assistant.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.462 align:middle line:84%
And I had to confess to
him that I could not read.

00:24:27.462 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And remember at
this point, I still

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:84%
had a mouthful of
mercury fillings.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, doctor,
you don't understand.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I can't go to dental school.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:90%
I can't read.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And he scratched his
head a little bit

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and said, what do you
mean you can't read?

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:41.045 align:middle line:90%
I said, I can't read.

00:24:41.045 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was a
music major in college.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:90%
He says, well, wait a minute.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.592 align:middle line:84%
Let me think about
that for a moment.

00:24:46.592 --> 00:24:49.050 align:middle line:84%
He thinks about it for a moment
and he says, you know what?

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.575 align:middle line:90%
Dentists don't read.

00:24:50.575 --> 00:24:53.700 align:middle line:90%
He says, can you memorize stuff?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.472 align:middle line:90%
Of course I can memorize stuff.

00:24:55.472 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, if you
can memorize stuff,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.347 align:middle line:90%
you can go to dental school.

00:24:58.347 --> 00:24:59.730 align:middle line:90%
And he was absolutely right.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Dental school was primarily
about memorization,

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.910 align:middle line:84%
memorizing a huge
amount of material.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if I'm a
patient coming to you,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:90%
what should I expect?

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: If you're a
patient coming to me,

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
you're going to expect to have
a very long examination, two

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:90%
to three hours long.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I will have you do
a blood chemistry

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
first, a hair analysis
first, a questionnaire.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.230 align:middle line:84%
All of that stuff is reviewed
during that first examination

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
before I ever look
inside of your mouth.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what's
really going on with you.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And most of our
patients will have

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:84%
a blood test done called
the biocompatibility test.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I own a company
called Biocomp, which

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
used to belong to
Dr. Hal Huggins,

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and I purchased the
company from him.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
We test patients' blood against
88 different dental components.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
through a computer,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and the computer
gives us a report

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and tells us, which
dental materials is

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
their body moderately OK with,
or which dental materials is

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:90%
their body not OK with?

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Those are what we
call least reactive.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:84%
We get the report
and it tells us

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.740 align:middle line:84%
ahead of time, what
dental materials should

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I have placed in my mouth?

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:10%
I often give the
analogy to patients,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.930 align:middle line:10%
if you had an allergy
to dairy, would you

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:10%
walk into a French restaurant
and tell the waiter,

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:10%
why don't you just bring me
whatever you think is good?

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that?

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Because in a French restaurant,
more likely than not,

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get a
dish with cream in it.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:84%
French cooking is
cream and butter.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two
ingredients they start with.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Cream and butter, right?

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So why do we go
into a dental office

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and ask the dentist to put in
whatever material they think

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:84%
is best when the
dentist doesn't even

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:84%
know what you're allergic to
and what you're not allergic to?

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.883 align:middle line:10%
What is your body
going to react to,

00:27:00.883 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:10%
and what's your
body going to say?

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe not self, but
OK, we can live with this.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And I think
that's so important,

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into
deeper conversation about all

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.410 align:middle line:84%
the labs and what they
mean in another show.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Dr.
Blanche, for sharing

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
all of your exceptional
information with us,

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:84%
