[Music_]

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:36.769 align:middle line:84%
>> We've all heard of
spontaneous healing and even

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.171 align:middle line:90%
remote healing by now.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.756 align:middle line:84%
While mainstream
science is still

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:42.476 align:middle line:84%
searching for a credible
hypothesis for the phenomenon,

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:44.644 align:middle line:90%
others are using it to heal.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.414 align:middle line:84%
Richard Gordon has been
healing with his hands and mind

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.283 align:middle line:84%
for decades, and is the
founder of Quantum Touch.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:84%
The amazing news is that
he says anyone can do this.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.755 align:middle line:84%
He's with us today to
share the background

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.859 align:middle line:84%
of this amazing science and
demonstrate how it works.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.494 align:middle line:84%
So glad to have you
with us Richard.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Hey,
it's my pleasure to be here.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.096 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's start the conversation
where we should start it.

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:08.702 align:middle line:84%
You were blown away, this is a
long time ago now, decades ago,

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:11.905 align:middle line:84%
when you started seeing
this phenomenon in action

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.108 align:middle line:84%
and you took it from there, you
studied with a wonderful man

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.877 align:middle line:90%
and then you expanded on it.

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.273 align:middle line:84%
So let's start at the beginning
of your discovery path.

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:21.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well the
discovery path goes way back,

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.378 align:middle line:84%
but in 1978 when my first
book, "Your Healing Hands"

00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:28.411 align:middle line:84%
was about to come out, I
met a gentleman named Robert

00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:31.885 align:middle line:84%
Rasmussen at the first workshop
that he ever presented and he

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:34.426 align:middle line:84%
was this guy telling tall tales
and I didn't believe anything

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:34.827 align:middle line:90%
he said.

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:37.597 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Oh yeah, I just touch
people and the bones move back

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.833 align:middle line:84%
into alignment and I
dissolved the tumor the size

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.836 align:middle line:84%
of a grapefruit and this child
broke his leg and then...."

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.589 align:middle line:84%
You know, later that day he
was walking around the swimming

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:48.041 align:middle line:84%
pool again, and I just
didn't believe him,

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.205 align:middle line:84%
but then he demonstrated
on a friend of mine who

00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:53.143 align:middle line:84%
had major scoliosis and he said,
"Well, see how the hips are all

00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:55.579 align:middle line:84%
twisted," and then he just
touched and the bones moved

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.018 align:middle line:84%
back into alignment and
then the shoulder came down

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.353 align:middle line:84%
and the spine started
straightening out

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.674 align:middle line:84%
and my jaw was
opened, and I assumed

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:04.591 align:middle line:90%
he had some kind of rare gift.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.161 align:middle line:84%
I was never going to be able
to learn it and no one else

00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:07.961 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.363 align:middle line:84%
But I found out in the
course of that workshop

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:14.701 align:middle line:84%
that not only could I do it but
other people could do it too.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.838 align:middle line:84%
I apprenticed with him,
I studied with him,

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I eventually evolved the
work, created a business

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.094 align:middle line:84%
and a company called
Quantum Touch.

00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:23.677 align:middle line:84%
We've been taking
it around the world.

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:27.271 align:middle line:84%
We've got thousands of
practitioners in over 70

00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:29.149 align:middle line:84%
countries right
now, showing things

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.017 align:middle line:90%
that we never thought possible.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, how long ago
did Quantum Touch start?

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.194 align:middle line:84%
I just ask for myself
because it seems

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
like I've heard about
Quantum Touch forever.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.358 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.228 align:middle line:84%
I first learned to
run the energy in 1978

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and I started teaching
some rudimentary classes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.165 align:middle line:90%
a couple years after that.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:51.371 align:middle line:84%
Then about 1995, 1996 I gave
it the name Quantum Touch.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I took over in Bob
Rasmussen's retirement

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and I've been taking it
around the world since then.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay, so you, as you
say, you evolved the work.

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:02.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Tremendously.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:05.148 align:middle line:84%
>> You turned it into Quantum
Touch and the word you hear

00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:08.104 align:middle line:84%
there is Quantum and Touch, okay
so you have a couple different

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.919 align:middle line:84%
strands of energetic
information going on, physical

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:11.791 align:middle line:90%
and physical.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:12.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Exactly

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:16.347 align:middle line:84%
>> And at what point did you
evolve it to where you could

00:03:16.347 --> 00:03:19.126 align:middle line:84%
eliminate the hands
altogether and just work with

00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:90%
the intention of the mind?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.968 align:middle line:90%
Well and some other dynamics.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah, all
this time we were doing hands

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.762 align:middle line:84%
on work because that's
how we saw it going,

00:03:25.762 --> 00:03:28.184 align:middle line:84%
which is great because you
can concentrate for hours with

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:29.142 align:middle line:90%
your hands on somebody.

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.411 align:middle line:84%
It's still a
wonderful way to work

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.147 align:middle line:84%
but about four years
ago a friend of mine,

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.143 align:middle line:84%
we were having dinner with some
other people and he said, "Oh,

00:03:37.143 --> 00:03:39.309 align:middle line:84%
show this woman how you can
adjust the hips without,

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.788 align:middle line:84%
you know, with a light touch,"
and I was about to do it

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "You know,
I bet you can do that

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.824 align:middle line:90%
without touching it."

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:45.825 align:middle line:90%
I said really?

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.193 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Yeah, give it a try."

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:49.161 align:middle line:84%
So I stood back there
and what surprised

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.531 align:middle line:90%
me was I knew how to do it.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.601 align:middle line:84%
And I just used
consciousness and in seconds,

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.704 align:middle line:84%
just a few seconds, her
hips weren't twisted,

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.807 align:middle line:84%
and that really surprised me and
once I saw that I said, "Hey,

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
if we can do this what
else is possible?"

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.113 align:middle line:84%
And that opened up a whole
new set of possibilities,

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:11.459 align:middle line:84%
so we called that the New Human,
these new human abilities that

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.486 align:middle line:90%
have been undocumented.

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:18.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet, remote healing has
been in existence almost since

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:23.588 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of time so this
must have inspired you to start

00:04:23.588 --> 00:04:26.523 align:middle line:84%
looking into maybe the
historical uses of remote

00:04:26.523 --> 00:04:29.336 align:middle line:84%
healing and give us some
background on remote healing.

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:31.037 align:middle line:84%
Where it starts
showing up in text

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.572 align:middle line:84%
and how it was
used historically.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well I'm not
a historian on remote healing

00:04:35.113 --> 00:04:38.109 align:middle line:84%
but we had been using remote
healing in Quantum Touch

00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:42.574 align:middle line:84%
forever basically, but to be
able to have a level of freedom

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:46.219 align:middle line:84%
that we never imagined in the
work, that's what's surprising.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:50.444 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I was able
to work on hundreds of people

00:04:50.444 --> 00:04:52.625 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously at a conference.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.628 align:middle line:84%
I gave a keynote address at
the University of Hong Kong

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.906 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted
to see if I could

00:04:57.906 --> 00:04:59.366 align:middle line:90%
untwist people's hips on stage.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:02.369 align:middle line:84%
We had 17 people on stage
and I did it out loud.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.169 align:middle line:84%
What it is I, I
said first I'm going

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.123 align:middle line:84%
to look at everybody on stage
and get a sense of everybody

00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:09.492 align:middle line:84%
here, now I'm going
to close my eyes

00:05:09.492 --> 00:05:11.745 align:middle line:84%
and merge everybody
into one iconic being.

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:14.203 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm just going to untwist
this [inaudible], which we'll

00:05:14.203 --> 00:05:15.806 align:middle line:84%
talk about later
as you asked me to,

00:05:15.806 --> 00:05:18.585 align:middle line:84%
and then I took about
four or five seconds,

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.554 align:middle line:84%
we had somebody measuring
every single person before this

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and when I was done we
measured everybody again

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.525 align:middle line:90%
and they were all untwisted.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:28.395 align:middle line:84%
Then we did 400 people
simultaneously in the audience.

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:31.898 align:middle line:84%
Now, sure, remote healing
has gone on forever,

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
but to have this level
of freedom and ability

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.129 align:middle line:84%
to work across time and space;
to work on multiple people

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.707 align:middle line:84%
at once; to do things
we had never imagined,

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:44.278 align:middle line:84%
even a way to assist people
at shifting their own core

00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:45.078 align:middle line:90%
beliefs.

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.494 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a two
person job where

00:05:46.494 --> 00:05:48.168 align:middle line:84%
we both have to work
together but you

00:05:48.168 --> 00:05:51.184 align:middle line:84%
can help people even change
core beliefs with energy.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.486 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the
limits of this work.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:54.402 --> 00:05:56.506 align:middle line:84%
It's really... it's
scientifically...we're just

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.516 align:middle line:84%
beginning and we're going
to talk about a wonderful

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:01.452 align:middle line:84%
experiment that you
plan to conduct,

00:06:01.452 --> 00:06:03.808 align:middle line:90%
which I think is so fascinating.

00:06:03.808 --> 00:06:06.099 align:middle line:84%
Before that though, let's
get a little more background.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.878 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Norman Shealy
came into your realm

00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:11.549 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
that whole experience

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:13.683 align:middle line:90%
and what he learned from it.

00:06:13.683 --> 00:06:16.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah, Elmer
Green wanted me to meet Norm

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:16.452 align:middle line:90%
Shealy.

00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:18.355 align:middle line:84%
He's the Father of
Biofeedback and he

00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
said it's not enough to get
Norm excited about your work,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.383 align:middle line:84%
we've got to make sure that
he actually researches it.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.085 align:middle line:84%
So, I got on a plane, went
to Norm Shealy's place

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:30.049 align:middle line:84%
and he's known, he's Founder
and President of the American

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:31.257 align:middle line:90%
Holistic Medical Association.

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.525 align:middle line:84%
He was a brain
surgeon by training.

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:36.563 align:middle line:84%
The guy is known as a skeptic
and even lives in Missouri.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:39.428 align:middle line:84%
>> He is a man of science and
he is in the "Show Me" state,

00:06:39.428 --> 00:06:39.632 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:40.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: He really is.

00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:43.503 align:middle line:84%
So he had me work on his
secretary, his accountant,

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:46.755 align:middle line:84%
his nurses and the back pain,
the neck pain, the shoulder

00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:48.308 align:middle line:84%
pain all that stuff
just disappeared

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:50.977 align:middle line:84%
within a couple minutes of
me working on each person.

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Then he said let's give you
somebody more challenging.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.251 align:middle line:84%
Brought in a woman about 90
years old with a walker and--

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.652 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not fair.

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:02.341 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: They took her
history for like a half an hour

00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:04.757 align:middle line:84%
and I realized when you're 90
you've got a lot of history.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I finally said, "Can I show you
what I do?" and he said, "Yes,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.864 align:middle line:84%
of course," and I
measured her hips

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:13.233 align:middle line:84%
and they were massively
out of alignment.

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:15.942 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
touched as lightly

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:18.031 align:middle line:84%
as I could and her
hips rolled back

00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:19.656 align:middle line:84%
to alignment, her
doctor came over, put

00:07:19.656 --> 00:07:23.176 align:middle line:84%
her fingers on her hips, jaw
opened, perfect Kodak moment,

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:26.213 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Norm, are you
impressed?" and he said, "No,

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:27.013 align:middle line:90%
I'm not impressed."

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:28.934 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, I'm not
always this successful.

00:07:28.934 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always
work this well."

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.391 align:middle line:84%
I said, "What's it going
to take to impress you?"

00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:34.821 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I don't have to do
a double blind on everything

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:35.628 align:middle line:90%
that I test.

00:07:35.628 --> 00:07:38.057 align:middle line:84%
I just have to make
the test so rigorous,

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe anything
but the outcome."

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.945 align:middle line:84%
So, the next day he set up all
his most difficult chronic pain

00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:47.433 align:middle line:84%
patients, people with 20 and
30 years of constant pain

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:50.437 align:middle line:84%
who had never been helped by
a traditional or alternative

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:51.237 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.653 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, okay
if you're going

00:07:52.653 --> 00:07:54.514 align:middle line:84%
to gang up on me
that way, I trained

00:07:54.514 --> 00:07:57.271 align:middle line:84%
his secretary, his accountant
and nurses how to do

00:07:57.271 --> 00:07:58.845 align:middle line:90%
energy work and Norm, too.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:01.981 align:middle line:84%
So we worked on these people
as a group and everyone had

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:05.218 align:middle line:84%
between a 30 and 70 percent
reduction in their pain,

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:09.308 align:middle line:84%
and what impressed Norm
more was ten days later when

00:08:09.308 --> 00:08:11.224 align:middle line:84%
he called me up, he said,
"This is remarkable.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:13.723 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these
people is still

00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:15.865 align:middle line:84%
experiencing the
reduction of their pain

00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:17.297 align:middle line:90%
from a single session."

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:20.713 align:middle line:84%
Then, the thing that
impressed him the most

00:08:20.713 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
was the ability to
affect EEG at a distance.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.005 align:middle line:90%
That's the brain wave patterns.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.705 align:middle line:84%
So a person lays on
the table, he's not

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:84%
told he's going to be getting
a healing session, half

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.147 align:middle line:84%
an hour baseline, I get the
nod, I start running energy.

00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:36.811 align:middle line:84%
In the first five minutes
his central brain delta

00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:39.167 align:middle line:84%
tripled in amplitude
and the next 25 minutes

00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:41.613 align:middle line:84%
he got so, in the
next 5 minutes,

00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:44.205 align:middle line:84%
or 25 rather, he
got so quiet, Norm

00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:47.357 align:middle line:84%
said "If I had just seen
that last 5 minute segment

00:08:47.357 --> 00:08:50.163 align:middle line:84%
I might have thought
the man was brain dead."

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:51.531 align:middle line:90%
So he started calling me names.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.781 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well, Richard,
you're a world class healer."

00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:55.142 align:middle line:90%
I said, "No, Norm.

00:08:55.142 --> 00:08:58.838 align:middle line:84%
This is a basic human
skill" and he said, "Well,

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:03.042 align:middle line:84%
either you have the healthiest
ego or the best act."

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:07.713 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, when he called me up
to say every one of his staff

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:11.616 align:middle line:84%
members was able to affect EEG
at a distance, I said, "Norm,

00:09:11.616 --> 00:09:13.219 align:middle line:84%
what an extraordinary
coincidence.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:18.925 align:middle line:84%
All your staff are
world class healers."

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:21.497 align:middle line:84%
This is a basic human
skill that we're teaching

00:09:21.497 --> 00:09:23.874 align:middle line:84%
and, when I talk about
adjusting the posture,

00:09:23.874 --> 00:09:25.995 align:middle line:84%
the only reason
I talk about that

00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:29.035 align:middle line:84%
is that it's considered
physiologically impossible

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.736 align:middle line:84%
and it's visible
to the naked eye

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.805 align:middle line:84%
and it works on
virtually everyone.

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:35.675 align:middle line:84%
>> As Dean Radin, who you
know, I've interviewed, says,

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:84%
he calls it "spooky
action at a distance".

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: That's a
term from Einstein actually.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh is it his?

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:42.348 align:middle line:90%
He was quoting Einstein.

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.083 align:middle line:84%
Okay, spooky action
at a distance,

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.889 align:middle line:84%
is what they call it
right, because you're

00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:47.654 align:middle line:84%
affecting the material
world in a way

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:51.324 align:middle line:84%
that you shouldn't be able to,
through mechanistic science.

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Exactly.

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:55.828 align:middle line:84%
The mechanistic belief is
we're just a bunch of machines

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.633 align:middle line:84%
and even people
like Ray Kurzweil

00:09:57.633 --> 00:09:59.799 align:middle line:84%
thinks that one day we're
going to be able to upload

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.868 align:middle line:84%
or download our
consciousness to a machine.

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:03.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah right.

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:06.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: But when you
show that our love is actually

00:10:06.348 --> 00:10:09.245 align:middle line:84%
the real force that
changes the outer reality,

00:10:09.245 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of the
mechanistic viewpoint

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.363 align:middle line:84%
of science is just out the
window because they have not

00:10:17.363 --> 00:10:21.154 align:middle line:84%
considered that our
consciousness and our love is

00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:23.456 align:middle line:84%
real, and this
changes everything.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for a unified
field theory of reality

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.539 align:middle line:84%
and without consciousness
included in a unified field

00:10:30.539 --> 00:10:31.497 align:middle line:90%
theory it's incomplete.

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:34.267 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no unified field
without consciousness.

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:37.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: So my friend
made me a sign and the sign

00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:39.106 align:middle line:84%
said "Quantum theory
is incomplete.

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:39.906 align:middle line:90%
Free demo."

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:43.176 align:middle line:84%
And we were working on people
at a [inaudible] conference

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:45.545 align:middle line:84%
and just, you know,
out there demonstrating

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:49.882 align:middle line:84%
that we could just shift their
body with a consciousness.

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:50.961 align:middle line:90%
They were blown away.

00:10:50.961 --> 00:10:53.419 align:middle line:84%
>> At that I'm surprised you
weren't banned like some other

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:90%
people we talked to.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: We didn't
get to present at the conference

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:59.064 align:middle line:84%
but we got to show people at
the conference and they said

00:10:59.064 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
my God, we want you
to be a speaker.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.796 align:middle line:84%
But they're coming from a very
materialistic point of view

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:06.456 align:middle line:84%
up to this point,
kicking out some

00:11:06.456 --> 00:11:11.037 align:middle line:84%
of the recordings of Graham
Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.037 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:12.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Crazy.

00:11:12.837 --> 00:11:14.898 align:middle line:84%
So it shows that there's
quite a limitation

00:11:14.898 --> 00:11:16.522 align:middle line:84%
to what Ted is willing
to put out there

00:11:16.522 --> 00:11:18.088 align:middle line:90%
by way of conscious evolution.

00:11:18.088 --> 00:11:19.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Up till now.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:20.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Up till now.

00:11:20.202 --> 00:11:22.202 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying it's
going to be changing maybe

00:11:22.202 --> 00:11:26.385 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the [inaudible]
taking down Graham and Rupert.

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:29.978 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was quite
an outcry over that.

00:11:29.978 --> 00:11:32.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: I know and
I was one of the people crying

00:11:32.478 --> 00:11:33.025 align:middle line:90%
out to--

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And Deepak Chopra as well.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.729 align:middle line:84%
There were many of you
speaking up on their behalf.

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.431 align:middle line:84%
Like, why are you
limiting the messages

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:41.534 align:middle line:84%
to what the healing
being's potential is?

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well when
people see that we can actually

00:11:44.234 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:84%
do things in the physical world
that's tangible, measurable,

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.945 align:middle line:84%
reproducible, it fits in what
science is supposed to be,

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:52.745 align:middle line:90%
empirical.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right
and, fortunately,

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
we know the story of
what science has become.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.653 align:middle line:84%
It has evolved to a thing where
you have to secure grants,

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.832 align:middle line:84%
you have to please your
peers and so forth, there's

00:12:02.832 --> 00:12:03.656 align:middle line:90%
tenure involved.

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.324 align:middle line:84%
But I want to finish
up on Normal Shealy.

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:06.926 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if I read
this comment to you?

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:07.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Please.

00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:08.961 align:middle line:90%
>> There is this quote.

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:10.873 align:middle line:84%
It said, he was speaking
of Quantum Touch

00:12:10.873 --> 00:12:13.199 align:middle line:84%
after he went through this
whole experience with you.

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:16.684 align:middle line:84%
He said, "This may be the
first technique that may

00:12:16.684 --> 00:12:19.071 align:middle line:90%
allow all of us to be healers."

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:22.208 align:middle line:84%
Now, you touched on
this a moment ago.

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The reason it has existed
throughout history,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.335 align:middle line:84%
both with touch
and with the mind,

00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:29.988 align:middle line:84%
is because it is working in
the quantum soup as it were,

00:12:29.988 --> 00:12:32.445 align:middle line:84%
but it is our
birthright as humans

00:12:32.445 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
because we're
multidimensional and connected

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.145 align:middle line:84%
into these levels
of intelligence

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:39.525 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
material versus non material.

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:42.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah,
what happens is there is this

00:12:42.068 --> 00:12:45.598 align:middle line:84%
junction between the quantum
world and our consciousness.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:52.071 align:middle line:84%
We are 99.999999999 percent
empty space and the fact

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.567 align:middle line:84%
that we can even
see each other is

00:12:53.567 --> 00:12:55.274 align:middle line:90%
a just a little trick of light.

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:56.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:56.352 --> 00:12:58.643 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: And that
which is not empty space is

00:12:58.643 --> 00:13:02.281 align:middle line:84%
just energy and it doesn't have
matter to it as we know matter.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:04.617 align:middle line:84%
It pops in and out of
existence all the time.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:09.121 align:middle line:84%
Love is that universal energy
that affects these things.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.551 align:middle line:84%
So the Quantum
Touch practitioner

00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:13.421 align:middle line:84%
is different than the
other practitioners

00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:16.599 align:middle line:84%
that I know of because
we use breathing and body

00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:18.865 align:middle line:84%
awareness to raise
our vibration really,

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:22.034 align:middle line:84%
really high throughout the
session so we don't get drained

00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:23.736 align:middle line:90%
or tired from doing the work.

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:26.138 align:middle line:84%
We do it through breathing
and body awareness primarily.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:29.175 align:middle line:84%
In the advanced work we learn
to raise the heart vibration,

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:31.534 align:middle line:84%
really open it up
and project it,

00:13:31.534 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and that love and
adoration energy

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
is a really super,
fantastic way of working.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.547 align:middle line:84%
Then we project it and we're
light beings and so of course

00:13:41.547 --> 00:13:44.223 align:middle line:84%
the energy's going to
work on the light being.

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:46.959 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're bringing
down pain, inflammation,

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.729 align:middle line:84%
accelerating the healing process
and doing a lot of other things

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:53.766 align:middle line:84%
that we see, and these are all
tangible, measurable things

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:84%
but the energy itself is
not measurable because it's

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.071 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual energy.

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:01.225 align:middle line:84%
So from the material
point of view

00:14:01.225 --> 00:14:02.942 align:middle line:84%
there can't be
anything happening

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:07.114 align:middle line:84%
because they don't see anything
that they can measure or do

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:09.155 align:middle line:84%
mathematics on it because
that's what [inaudible]

00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:11.527 align:middle line:84%
was talking about, through
measure and numbers

00:14:11.527 --> 00:14:13.219 align:middle line:90%
we will conquer nature.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.854 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
what this is about.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:84%
This is about
affecting the reality

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.103 align:middle line:84%
and allowing it to do its
own self healing because we

00:14:21.103 --> 00:14:23.573 align:middle line:84%
like to say that the
definition of a healer

00:14:23.573 --> 00:14:25.829 align:middle line:84%
was someone who was
sick and got well,

00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:28.417 align:middle line:84%
and a great healer is
someone who was very sick

00:14:28.417 --> 00:14:29.402 align:middle line:90%
and got well quickly.

00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:32.505 align:middle line:84%
So I don't ever call
myself a healer and none

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
of our practitioners do either.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.554 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we hold that
field and then the other person

00:14:38.554 --> 00:14:41.113 align:middle line:84%
matches the vibration
of the practitioner

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:43.816 align:middle line:84%
so you continue lifting
yourself throughout the session.

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:45.406 align:middle line:90%
That way, they match you.

00:14:45.406 --> 00:14:49.388 align:middle line:84%
You never get drained or tired
and come down to match them.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:52.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and what you spoke
about a moment ago about this

00:14:52.464 --> 00:14:56.028 align:middle line:84%
frequency of love and when we
were looking at this segment

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and, gee, how do we give
a description of it?

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.932 align:middle line:90%
Do we have to use the word love?

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.253 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it a little new-agey?

00:15:01.253 --> 00:15:03.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: No, it's
not new agey and, in fact,

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:06.148 align:middle line:84%
everyone that I've interviewed
in the world of science,

00:15:06.148 --> 00:15:09.694 align:middle line:84%
particularly quantum physics,
acknowledges that whatever that

00:15:09.694 --> 00:15:14.595 align:middle line:84%
thing is that we produce in
the field that we call love,

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that exalted state of
consciousness in being

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.032 align:middle line:84%
and feeling, seems to be,
as William Teller calls it,

00:15:22.032 --> 00:15:23.222 align:middle line:90%
a "universal solvent."

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:26.592 align:middle line:84%
>>It is the fabric of
the universe right?

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.594 align:middle line:84%
I mean at the highest
frequencies that penetrates

00:15:29.594 --> 00:15:30.506 align:middle line:90%
all these dimensions.

00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:31.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Yes.

00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:32.631 align:middle line:90%
It goes across time.

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.834 align:middle line:90%
It goes across space.

00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:39.872 align:middle line:84%
See, the mechanists think love
is an electromagnetic energy

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:42.775 align:middle line:84%
that we're just projecting from
our electrochemical reaction

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.378 align:middle line:84%
in the brain or a sentiment
on a card or something.

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:48.014 align:middle line:84%
I feel that you feel, and we've
kind of had this delusion,

00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:50.816 align:middle line:84%
we both feel it together,
but it's an actual force

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:52.418 align:middle line:90%
that changes the outer world.

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.121 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: And
that's the real key.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:58.758 align:middle line:84%
So, as an example, I've
got this little kitten

00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:01.266 align:middle line:84%
and she was a rescue
cat and she was a little

00:16:01.266 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:90%
desperate for attention.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So even at six months
she's crawling all over me

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.298 align:middle line:90%
and just can't get enough love.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.194 align:middle line:84%
So I'm talking to a
friend who's still

00:16:08.194 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to process the
forceps birth that he had

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:11.871 align:middle line:90%
by going back.

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:13.539 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Why don't
you change the past?"

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:15.775 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well, you know,
that's just not integrated."

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:18.066 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, I'm going to
do it right now on my cat."

00:16:18.066 --> 00:16:21.647 align:middle line:84%
So I meditated at the café
for about four or five minutes

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:25.384 align:middle line:84%
and what I saw was my little
kitten and she was nursing with

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.186 align:middle line:84%
mommy and then I saw
her being bottle fed.

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:28.668 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, you
don't want that"

00:16:28.668 --> 00:16:30.043 align:middle line:84%
and I picked up
the little kitten

00:16:30.043 --> 00:16:31.376 align:middle line:90%
and I brought her back to mommy.

00:16:31.376 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:84%
This is all my imagination,
and I'm running hard energy

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.962 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sending her the
love as if I was helping

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
somebody's knee or
somebody with dementia

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
or whatever problem I'm working
on, I just send her the love.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.337 align:middle line:84%
In time, when I got home
to my shock and surprise,

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.972 align:middle line:84%
she's totally
comfortable sitting

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:48.607 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the room.

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.182 align:middle line:84%
Later, as I was
watching a movie,

00:16:50.182 --> 00:16:52.272 align:middle line:84%
she got on the far
side of the couch

00:16:52.272 --> 00:16:53.646 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
leaned against me.

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:55.616 align:middle line:84%
Now she comes up to
me about two or three

00:16:55.616 --> 00:16:58.354 align:middle line:84%
times a day for five or ten
minutes for intense affection

00:16:58.354 --> 00:17:01.378 align:middle line:84%
but then she's done and
she's not clingy anymore,

00:17:01.378 --> 00:17:04.541 align:middle line:84%
and it only took a
few minutes and that's

00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:05.925 align:middle line:90%
working across time and space.

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's across
all belief boundaries.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.727 align:middle line:84%
There is no belief;
it's your kitty cat.

00:17:09.727 --> 00:17:11.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
Speaking of belief,

00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:12.998 align:middle line:84%
one of my co writers
Chris Duffield,

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:16.535 align:middle line:84%
he won a Presidential Scholar
Award, really bright guy.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:19.019 align:middle line:84%
It took him over ten
years of being my friend

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:22.708 align:middle line:84%
before he started getting over
his skepticism about this work.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:26.378 align:middle line:84%
He'd eventually, you know, seen
it work over and over again,

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:30.349 align:middle line:84%
seen other people being able to
do it and eventually, oh dread,

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:32.485 align:middle line:90%
seeing himself doing it.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:34.885 align:middle line:84%
He said that it's as
if I've discovered

00:17:34.885 --> 00:17:37.288 align:middle line:84%
a new human operating
system and now we're

00:17:37.288 --> 00:17:38.791 align:middle line:90%
discovering all of the apps.

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:41.861 align:middle line:84%
He said these human
abilities, as a scientist,

00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:45.057 align:middle line:84%
are as surprising to him as
discovering that we could

00:17:45.057 --> 00:17:48.238 align:middle line:84%
breathe underwater or fly, but
the thing that he likes best

00:17:48.238 --> 00:17:51.426 align:middle line:84%
about it is that it works,
even when he knows it won't.

00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:52.226 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:17:52.226 --> 00:17:55.508 align:middle line:84%
Even he made a sign that
said "Free, one minute,

00:17:55.508 --> 00:17:57.348 align:middle line:84%
no touch healing sessions"
and he brought it

00:17:57.348 --> 00:17:59.912 align:middle line:84%
to a farmer's market and
people are coming up to him--

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:00.913 align:middle line:90%
>> And he was doing it?

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
He was doing it.

00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:90%
To his chagrin, it was working.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.674 align:middle line:84%
He comes to my
workshop and this man

00:18:06.674 --> 00:18:08.485 align:middle line:84%
has this sinus
pain that he's had

00:18:08.485 --> 00:18:10.589 align:middle line:84%
since he was a teenager,
got into an accident.

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Chris is a good
meditator, he's meditating

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.166 align:middle line:84%
and the man stops
him after two minutes

00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:17.715 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Oh, I just heard
a loud snapping in my face

00:18:17.715 --> 00:18:19.899 align:middle line:84%
and something moved
and now I can breathe,"

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:22.045 align:middle line:90%
and Chris, his jaw is open.

00:18:22.045 --> 00:18:24.336 align:middle line:84%
Chris is at the workshop and
he's working with a woman.

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:26.244 align:middle line:84%
We have this
meditation where we're

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:28.586 align:middle line:84%
holding the baby of the
person you're working on

00:18:28.586 --> 00:18:31.821 align:middle line:84%
because none of us got as much
love as we wanted as an infant

00:18:31.821 --> 00:18:32.745 align:middle line:90%
or as much touch.

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:36.005 align:middle line:84%
So he's holding this
stranger to him as a baby

00:18:36.005 --> 00:18:38.492 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of
the eight minutes

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:41.053 align:middle line:84%
that he's doing this
meditation he opens his eyes

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:43.055 align:middle line:84%
and she has tears
streaming down her face

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:45.791 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "You know I
never had a father in my life

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.993 align:middle line:84%
and I always felt
something was missing,

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:50.696 align:middle line:84%
and somehow I don't feel
anything's missing anymore.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.798 align:middle line:90%
I got the love that I needed."

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.376 align:middle line:90%
>> It can happen that quickly.

00:18:54.376 --> 00:18:57.836 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful that
frequency that we call love is.

00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:59.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Exactly.

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:02.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe there needs to be even
a more elevated term for it

00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:06.178 align:middle line:84%
so people don't get confused
with sentimental love

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and universal love, the
universal solvent of love,

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.715 align:middle line:90%
which is non-, what is the word?

00:19:15.715 --> 00:19:17.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
It's non inculturated.

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:18.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Non-inculturated, exactly.

00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:20.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah
it's not mommy to baby,

00:19:20.624 --> 00:19:22.928 align:middle line:84%
it's not husband to wife
or brother to sister.

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:26.365 align:middle line:84%
This is the love that
we feel inside ourselves

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.773 align:middle line:90%
because we exist.

00:19:27.773 --> 00:19:28.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:28.573 --> 00:19:31.904 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is people
that do various seminars

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:34.674 align:middle line:84%
and have written a lot of books
on how to manifest in your life

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:35.474 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:37.643 align:middle line:84%
It's no more than the
exact same frequency.

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:41.046 align:middle line:84%
Everything that comes comes from
this frequency more or less.

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:45.462 align:middle line:84%
The intensity and passion and
power of the human thought

00:19:45.462 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:84%
mechanism combined,
ideally, with the same thing

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.022 align:middle line:84%
of the heart, the
heart mechanism,

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.624 align:middle line:84%
and this is Heart
Math Institute.

00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:54.378 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has been
studied now ad nauseam

00:19:54.378 --> 00:19:56.317 align:middle line:84%
and proven out over
and over again.

00:19:56.317 --> 00:19:58.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: And the Heart
Math Institute and other groups

00:19:58.983 --> 00:20:01.233 align:middle line:84%
are always showing these
electromagnetic field charts;

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.569 align:middle line:84%
showing the amazing
field of the heart,

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:06.338 align:middle line:84%
but what we're doing
is not electromagnetic

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:09.821 align:middle line:84%
because distance means nothing
and light and electromagnetism

00:20:09.821 --> 00:20:11.777 align:middle line:90%
fall off from the source.

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:13.512 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't fall off at all.

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:17.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Well you're basically
extending it out in the way you

00:20:17.787 --> 00:20:22.258 align:middle line:84%
teach into other dimensional
realities beyond the time space

00:20:22.258 --> 00:20:24.189 align:middle line:84%
continuum of the
third dimension.

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:26.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: So it's not
an electromagnetic phenomenon

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.528 align:middle line:84%
because that's an extension
of material science that wants

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:31.964 align:middle line:84%
to say oh, we can measure
this electromagnetic field.

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:35.428 align:middle line:84%
It isn't measurable because
spiritual energy is not

00:20:35.428 --> 00:20:37.002 align:middle line:90%
going to be measured.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
is intrinsic within us

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.777 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the great
mysteries and the great magic

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:45.844 align:middle line:90%
that we're involved in.

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:47.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Well and it goes
back to this thing.

00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:48.847 align:middle line:84%
You've already touched on
it, you've already said it,

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:50.883 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think you
can overstate it enough.

00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
If you were looking at it from
an atomic model point of view,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.188 align:middle line:84%
you see a few electrons
swirling around

00:20:58.188 --> 00:21:01.569 align:middle line:84%
and this vast amount
of atomic space

00:21:01.569 --> 00:21:07.265 align:middle line:84%
is similar to watching X number
of planets circling our sun

00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:09.134 align:middle line:90%
and our solar system.

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:11.906 align:middle line:84%
That's how much space
there is in every atom

00:21:11.906 --> 00:21:15.074 align:middle line:84%
of every cell of every
physical thing on this planet.

00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:15.908 align:middle line:90%
It's all space.

00:21:15.908 --> 00:21:18.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: It's
inconceivable how much space

00:21:18.075 --> 00:21:18.874 align:middle line:90%
there is.

00:21:18.874 --> 00:21:19.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:19.712 --> 00:21:22.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: It's like
eight or nine decimals of 99999

00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:23.015 align:middle line:90%
percent--

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Of what we are is just
space and space is energy,

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.424 align:middle line:84%
so of course the mind and the
heart is going to affect space.

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:34.126 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:37.162 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so let's go in to
when you're generating this,

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
you've already
talked about the fact

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.599 align:middle line:90%
that belief and skepticism.

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:43.102 align:middle line:84%
I mean we were
talking off camera.

00:21:43.102 --> 00:21:46.338 align:middle line:84%
There was a doctor and you
were showing him this work

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.826 align:middle line:84%
and he actually told
you at one point,

00:21:48.826 --> 00:21:50.912 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to see
how this turns out.

00:21:50.912 --> 00:21:52.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Oh
that was really funny.

00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:55.283 align:middle line:84%
I was at a conference,
it was a conference

00:21:55.283 --> 00:21:57.444 align:middle line:84%
called Tour to Science of
Consciousness and Chris

00:21:57.444 --> 00:22:00.662 align:middle line:84%
had made a big sign for me
that said, "Consciousness

00:22:00.662 --> 00:22:02.454 align:middle line:90%
effects matter, free demo."

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:05.657 align:middle line:84%
And all these scientists were
there and one comes up to me

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:07.926 align:middle line:84%
and says, "Alright,
what've you got?"

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.904 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I'm
going to demonstrate

00:22:09.904 --> 00:22:11.278 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
effects matter

00:22:11.278 --> 00:22:12.598 align:middle line:90%
by untwisting your hips."

00:22:12.598 --> 00:22:14.733 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mentioned
the hips before.

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:17.169 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that's
physiologically impossible.

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.138 align:middle line:84%
I understand that
your hips are twisted.

00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:21.207 align:middle line:84%
You have no physiological
way of untwisting them

00:22:21.207 --> 00:22:22.007 align:middle line:90%
and it's visible.

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.655 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reason I talk about it

00:22:23.655 --> 00:22:26.542 align:middle line:84%
because most of the humans
have all kinds of real issues

00:22:26.542 --> 00:22:27.646 align:middle line:90%
that you care about.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.848 align:middle line:84%
So he said, "Well,
that's impossible."

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:32.484 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Great,
hold that thought."

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I said to make it
even so I measure

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.444 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Oh my
goodness, you are

00:22:36.444 --> 00:22:38.857 align:middle line:84%
twisted more than almost
anybody I've ever met."

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.592 align:middle line:90%
He was like really far off.

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:43.195 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "To make it
harder on me, why don't you

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:90%
lock your hips in place?"

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.333 align:middle line:84%
So he locks his hips and I
meditate for a few seconds

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.221 align:middle line:84%
and I measure him
and said, "Oh look!

00:22:50.221 --> 00:22:51.787 align:middle line:90%
They're completely even now."

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Well, of course.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.839 align:middle line:84%
You used reverse
psychology on me."

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.484 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Would you
consider yourself

00:22:55.484 --> 00:22:56.442 align:middle line:90%
an empirical scientist?

00:22:56.442 --> 00:22:57.242 align:middle line:90%
Or faith-based?"

00:22:57.242 --> 00:22:58.404 align:middle line:90%
I was kind of abating.

00:22:58.404 --> 00:22:59.945 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well,
empirical of course."

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.632 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Great,
then why don't you

00:23:01.632 --> 00:23:04.438 align:middle line:84%
watch me do this on
five or ten more people

00:23:04.438 --> 00:23:06.819 align:middle line:84%
and see if I'm using
reverse psychology?"

00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:09.721 align:middle line:84%
He says, "If I let myself
believe this just happened,

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.191 align:middle line:84%
everything I know about science,
meaning material science,

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:14.526 align:middle line:84%
would fall like a
house of cards."

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:16.248 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, as an
empirical scientist,

00:23:16.248 --> 00:23:18.497 align:middle line:84%
don't you want to let the
cards fall where they will?"

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:20.933 align:middle line:84%
And he thought for a moment
and he said, "Not today"

00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:23.469 align:middle line:90%
and he just walked away.

00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:24.636 align:middle line:90%
>> And there you have it.

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:25.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
And there you have it.

00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.358 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the [inaudible] you
have between the two fields

00:23:27.358 --> 00:23:27.773 align:middle line:90%
of healing.

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:28.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Exactly.

00:23:28.898 --> 00:23:30.642 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean it is slowly
coming together.

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:34.746 align:middle line:84%
There are people who are coming
from the materialist portion

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:37.374 align:middle line:84%
of science or viewpoint
and crossing over

00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:40.252 align:middle line:84%
into the non-material because
of exactly things like this.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well this is
going to be the biggest shift

00:23:42.141 --> 00:23:42.941 align:middle line:90%
in 400 years.

00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:43.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:23:43.892 --> 00:23:46.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Because when
Galileo was saying the Earth

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:50.218 align:middle line:84%
goes around the sun and had to,
and that was exactly 400 years

00:23:50.218 --> 00:23:52.859 align:middle line:84%
ago from right now that he
was saying this and getting

00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:55.913 align:middle line:84%
in trouble for it, had to recant
or else he would have been

00:23:55.913 --> 00:23:58.203 align:middle line:84%
burned at the stake,
that was the big shift.

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:00.072 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the
big shift is going

00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:03.375 align:middle line:84%
to be from the material
science to realizing

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:09.615 align:middle line:84%
that our love is actually real
and we need to value our love

00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:12.279 align:middle line:84%
and value the love
all the animals have;

00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:15.861 align:middle line:84%
the plants; value the
Earth; value ourselves

00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:18.756 align:middle line:84%
and come from compassion
because that's

00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:20.459 align:middle line:84%
what's most lacking
in the world,

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.718 align:middle line:84%
is leaders who are coming
from the compassionate point

00:24:22.718 --> 00:24:23.518 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:24:23.518 --> 00:24:24.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:24.563 --> 00:24:27.237 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you do
these, these healing

00:24:27.237 --> 00:24:29.668 align:middle line:84%
sessions it happens
very quickly.

00:24:29.668 --> 00:24:32.357 align:middle line:84%
You've talked a few times
about straightening up

00:24:32.357 --> 00:24:36.441 align:middle line:84%
the pelvic girdle a little
bit and untwisting it,

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:38.051 align:middle line:84%
and there are other
layers to this,

00:24:38.051 --> 00:24:39.975 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to
get into in a moment

00:24:39.975 --> 00:24:42.923 align:middle line:84%
because I'd like you to give us
a real functional understanding

00:24:42.923 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:90%
of it as we continue our talk.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.053 align:middle line:84%
And also I want to talk
about the various conditions

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:50.088 align:middle line:84%
that you've seen
affected by this.

00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:53.817 align:middle line:84%
But first, why don't we take
a glimpse just before we

00:24:53.817 --> 00:24:57.729 align:middle line:84%
started the conversation, we
did a couple of little segments

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:84%
at people here at
Gaiam and we're

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.199 align:middle line:90%
going to take a look at that.

00:25:01.199 --> 00:26:03.061 align:middle line:84%
[Video Playing ] So
simple, so quick,

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:06.275 align:middle line:84%
but obviously there's some
other elements in there that are

00:26:06.275 --> 00:26:08.433 align:middle line:84%
hidden and it's the juju
that you were doing,

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:11.504 align:middle line:84%
which you can say we can all
do, and I want to start talking

00:26:11.504 --> 00:26:12.304 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:13.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Sure.

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:17.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you have intention,
you have mind and you have love

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:18.944 align:middle line:90%
going at the same time.

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:22.624 align:middle line:84%
So explain what you're actually
doing if you're setting

00:26:22.624 --> 00:26:23.815 align:middle line:90%
yourself up for a session.

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:26.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: In
that particular example

00:26:26.321 --> 00:26:30.543 align:middle line:84%
I'm generating the heart energy,
I'm using breathing and body

00:26:30.543 --> 00:26:33.423 align:middle line:84%
awareness in my system,
I'm actually visualizing

00:26:33.423 --> 00:26:35.927 align:middle line:84%
the sphenoid bone which
is behind the nose.

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:38.463 align:middle line:84%
It's the first bone
created in the embryo,

00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:42.134 align:middle line:84%
it supports the pituitary
gland then the sinuses.

00:26:42.134 --> 00:26:43.602 align:middle line:90%
It's really essential.

00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:45.337 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm doing
is I'm intending

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that it untwist itself
while I'm sending energy.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.002 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
fascinating is that I've

00:26:52.002 --> 00:26:53.364 align:middle line:90%
been doing it wrong for years.

00:26:53.364 --> 00:26:55.113 align:middle line:84%
>> You have been doing
it wrong for years?

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:56.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Yes.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:57.376 align:middle line:84%
I always visualize
that it moves this way

00:26:57.376 --> 00:26:59.175 align:middle line:84%
but then I found out
just like a year ago

00:26:59.175 --> 00:27:00.952 align:middle line:84%
that it was supposed
to go that way.

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:02.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Your adjustment
of the sphenoid?

00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:03.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah.

00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:05.757 align:middle line:84%
I was intending the sphenoid
bone moving to alignment

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:07.959 align:middle line:90%
but I was visualizing it wrong.

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:10.039 align:middle line:90%
But the universe understands.

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:84%
As Chris likes to call it
the benevolent infrastructure

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.934 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, aka
God, understands intent.

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:17.869 align:middle line:90%
Our intent is understood.

00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:21.373 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really good
demonstration and model

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that spiritual reality
understands our intent.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:26.484 --> 00:27:29.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: And whatever
you call it it's there and it

00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:29.825 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:27:29.825 --> 00:27:31.659 align:middle line:84%
So that's generally
that, but when

00:27:31.659 --> 00:27:34.882 align:middle line:84%
you're working on pain or
inflammation or chronic

00:27:34.882 --> 00:27:38.590 align:middle line:84%
conditions or whatever it is,
we can send the same energy.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.032 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're working
a long time on somebody

00:27:41.032 --> 00:27:42.794 align:middle line:84%
it's really good to
use your hands still.

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:45.797 align:middle line:84%
It's a very good way to work
because you can stay focused

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.699 align:middle line:90%
for very long periods of time.

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:51.089 align:middle line:84%
But if I was holding
somebody's head with my hands,

00:27:51.089 --> 00:27:52.464 align:middle line:84%
I could be working
on their feet,

00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:54.381 align:middle line:84%
I could be working on
their knee problem,

00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:57.641 align:middle line:84%
I could be working on their
organs and glands and systems

00:27:57.641 --> 00:28:00.383 align:middle line:84%
and their body, even
working on the dementia,

00:28:00.383 --> 00:28:04.463 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is because the
body responds to the energy

00:28:04.463 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:90%
as it will.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.354 align:middle line:84%
We provide the love and
it does the healing.

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:12.491 align:middle line:84%
>> How clear does your mind
have to be about the healing

00:28:12.491 --> 00:28:13.291 align:middle line:90%
intention?

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.488 align:middle line:84%
Where does the mind come
in in terms of focus?

00:28:15.488 --> 00:28:17.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: The
intention is very general.

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:19.566 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be that specific

00:28:19.566 --> 00:28:22.124 align:middle line:84%
because if you intend to walk
out the door you don't have

00:28:22.124 --> 00:28:23.665 align:middle line:84%
to question yourself,
well am I still

00:28:23.665 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:90%
intending to walk out the door?

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to beat
yourself up that way.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.776 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even be doing it
if you hadn't had the intent.

00:28:30.776 --> 00:28:33.512 align:middle line:84%
It's just a real
core thing about us.

00:28:33.512 --> 00:28:35.888 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with
like a grad student

00:28:35.888 --> 00:28:37.755 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking I
want to show them

00:28:37.755 --> 00:28:40.652 align:middle line:84%
how to do something for a
test, I just ask two questions.

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:43.989 align:middle line:84%
I say, "Do you know how to adore
kittens or babies or puppies

00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:46.224 align:middle line:84%
or do you have adoration
for anybody in the world?"

00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:48.026 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say,
"Yeah I do, I do."

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:50.173 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll say, "Do
you want to help people?"

00:28:50.173 --> 00:28:50.973 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:50.973 --> 00:28:53.698 align:middle line:84%
Okay, if they
answer affirmatively

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:55.553 align:middle line:84%
to those questions,
they're ready to learn.

00:28:55.553 --> 00:28:57.969 align:middle line:84%
But the people that say, "Well,
what do you mean 'adore?'"

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:58.837 align:middle line:90%
Okay, forget it.

00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:00.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Never mind.

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Never mind,
we'll work with somebody else

00:29:01.373 --> 00:29:03.074 align:middle line:84%
because they're too
much in their head.

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Right and that gets us into
another area we might touch

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:10.181 align:middle line:84%
on later which is some people
are psychopaths and it's very

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:15.287 align:middle line:84%
difficult if you happen
to be of that makeup;

00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:18.322 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult to create
healing in anything from that

00:29:18.322 --> 00:29:19.457 align:middle line:90%
place, no less yourself.

00:29:19.457 --> 00:29:21.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well it's
an interesting question to see

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:23.361 align:middle line:84%
if we can train psychopaths
to do this work.

00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:24.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:25.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: There might
actually be a psychopath test.

00:29:25.564 --> 00:29:26.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:26.793 --> 00:29:29.334 align:middle line:84%
>> But we really don't care as
long as people have compassion

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:32.537 align:middle line:84%
and empathy and love and
care about other people.

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:33.672 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:29:33.672 --> 00:29:35.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: We
can do this work, yeah.

00:29:35.547 --> 00:29:38.007 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay and in your book,
what you just explained sounds

00:29:38.007 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:90%
really easy.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:39.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: It is.

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:40.946 align:middle line:90%
>> It just takes a few seconds.

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:43.314 align:middle line:84%
However, if you haven't
done it before you're

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:46.435 align:middle line:84%
very good at guiding
people in your book,

00:29:46.435 --> 00:29:49.387 align:middle line:84%
the "Quantum Touch
2.0" step by step

00:29:49.387 --> 00:29:53.057 align:middle line:84%
in how you, because you just
glossed over and said first

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:84%
you get the heart going
and the body awareness

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.629 align:middle line:84%
and the breathing with
the body awareness.

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.464 align:middle line:84%
Now explain that
just a little bit.

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:01.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: We really
still encourage people to work

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:02.534 align:middle line:90%
with the basic Quantum Touch.

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:03.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: "The Quantum
Touch," "The Power to Heal."

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.771 align:middle line:84%
We've got live workshops,
video workshops

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:09.941 align:middle line:84%
and many other programs
people can work with.

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:12.542 align:middle line:84%
The book will even teach you
because I don't hold anything

00:30:12.542 --> 00:30:13.342 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:30:13.342 --> 00:30:15.814 align:middle line:84%
It's starts with breathing
and body awareness exercises

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:18.283 align:middle line:84%
where you can move awareness
through your whole system

00:30:18.283 --> 00:30:21.179 align:middle line:90%
in a sweep and it's really easy.

00:30:21.179 --> 00:30:22.387 align:middle line:90%
People learn it all the time.

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:24.222 align:middle line:84%
We have incredible
stories just coming

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:26.258 align:middle line:84%
from the first
day of a workshop.

00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:29.594 align:middle line:84%
Then, for those that want
to jump ahead that's fine

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:31.282 align:middle line:84%
or you want to work
through the program,

00:30:31.282 --> 00:30:33.345 align:middle line:84%
we teach people how to
work with hard energy

00:30:33.345 --> 00:30:35.854 align:middle line:84%
in the "Quantum Touch
2.0 The New Human"

00:30:35.854 --> 00:30:38.536 align:middle line:84%
and be able to do a
wide range of things.

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.426 align:middle line:84%
The exciting thing
about the advanced work

00:30:40.426 --> 00:30:43.341 align:middle line:84%
is it provides a much
higher level of freedom

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:45.777 align:middle line:84%
with more possibilities that
we hadn't even dreamed of.

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:49.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that more of the remote
work you're talking about?

00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:51.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Now we can do
the remote work with the basic

00:30:51.655 --> 00:30:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Quantum Touch but there's such
a higher level of freedom and it

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.890 align:middle line:84%
happens about three to five
times faster with the new work.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And some people, you said
yes it's good to go through

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.296 align:middle line:90%
the original Quantum Touch work.

00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:06.408 align:middle line:84%
Some people need,
their minds need

00:31:06.408 --> 00:31:08.753 align:middle line:84%
to be satisfied that it
understands protocols

00:31:08.753 --> 00:31:11.814 align:middle line:84%
and so forth to kind of
free them from any question

00:31:11.814 --> 00:31:13.223 align:middle line:90%
as to whether it can work.

00:31:13.223 --> 00:31:14.806 align:middle line:84%
Other people you can
probably teach it

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.341 align:middle line:90%
to in one or two minutes.

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.343 align:middle line:90%
They just inherently understand.

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:19.911 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that, okay I can do that.

00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:22.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: This is a
basic human skill and if it

00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:23.882 align:middle line:84%
wasn't I wouldn't
be able to teach it.

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:25.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: I would
guarantee people would be able

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:28.884 align:middle line:84%
to move bones into alignment
before lunch break on the first

00:31:28.884 --> 00:31:31.556 align:middle line:84%
day when I was lecturing all
over the world and everybody

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:32.356 align:middle line:90%
succeeded.

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:33.658 align:middle line:90%
No one fails.

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:35.527 align:middle line:90%
It's really that easy.

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:38.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about knitting
bones and let's talk about some

00:31:38.731 --> 00:31:39.531 align:middle line:90%
anecdotes.

00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:40.432 align:middle line:90%
I love anecdotes.

00:31:40.432 --> 00:31:41.533 align:middle line:90%
Some incredible stories.

00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:44.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: So for
instance a woman stepped off

00:31:44.036 --> 00:31:46.172 align:middle line:84%
a curb badly, her foot
went way off to the side,

00:31:46.172 --> 00:31:48.213 align:middle line:84%
her chiropractor said,
"Go to the emergency room.

00:31:48.213 --> 00:31:49.474 align:middle line:90%
You've got a broken bone."

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:51.547 align:middle line:84%
So while she's sitting
in the emergency room

00:31:51.547 --> 00:31:53.745 align:middle line:84%
she's running energy
into her painful leg.

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:56.959 align:middle line:84%
When she gets examined the
foot and leg have completely

00:31:56.959 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:84%
reset itself and they
don't have to set it.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.652 align:middle line:90%
All they do is put a cast on it.

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:04.356 align:middle line:84%
Another woman told me that
she attended the Quantum Touch

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:07.993 align:middle line:84%
workshop and she has had
bowed legs since she was born.

00:32:07.993 --> 00:32:10.399 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't allowed to take
ballet class because she

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:11.997 align:middle line:90%
had bowed legs so bad.

00:32:11.997 --> 00:32:13.965 align:middle line:90%
She attends the class.

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:15.799 align:middle line:84%
The next morning
when she wakes up she

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:17.508 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have bowed
legs anymore and she

00:32:17.508 --> 00:32:19.671 align:middle line:84%
starts having an arch
in her flat foot.

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:25.313 align:middle line:84%
Another woman tells me that she
had rheumatoid arthritis so bad

00:32:25.313 --> 00:32:27.879 align:middle line:84%
her children had to
hoist her out of bed.

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:32.117 align:middle line:84%
She had nine physicians talking
to her about her condition.

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:35.098 align:middle line:84%
One of them said to her
one day, "Within a year

00:32:35.098 --> 00:32:38.957 align:middle line:84%
you may well be confined
to a wheelchair and blind."

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:42.247 align:middle line:84%
And she just said,
"No, thank you"

00:32:42.247 --> 00:32:44.873 align:middle line:84%
and she decides to do
something fun that day

00:32:44.873 --> 00:32:47.832 align:middle line:84%
and she went to a dog show
because she loves dogs.

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:50.404 align:middle line:84%
And just like 1,400 dogs
there, she's in heaven

00:32:50.404 --> 00:32:52.904 align:middle line:84%
and she sees this woman doing
something called Quantum Touch

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:53.919 align:middle line:90%
and says, "what the hell.

00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:55.085 align:middle line:90%
I've tried everything else."

00:32:55.085 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
She lays down and her legs start
feeling good for the first time

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.913 align:middle line:84%
and she starts studying the
work, doing it on herself.

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:04.682 align:middle line:84%
Now she can walk her dogs
three to five, you know,

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:07.152 align:middle line:84%
two or three miles at a
time without any problem,

00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:09.521 align:middle line:84%
hours at a time out
there walking her dogs.

00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:10.855 align:middle line:90%
She does everything.

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:12.757 align:middle line:90%
She has no symptoms anymore.

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:14.573 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the limits
of what's possible

00:33:14.573 --> 00:33:17.429 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of the most
exciting places to come from.

00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:21.066 align:middle line:84%
>> So as people are listening
to this it's like wow, okay.

00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:22.834 align:middle line:84%
How is this different
from faith healing?

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:26.838 align:middle line:84%
Going to the big top with
Billy Graham and so forth?

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:30.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well one of
the things is this is actually

00:33:30.562 --> 00:33:33.589 align:middle line:84%
a skill unlike, you know, a
lot of hands on healing where

00:33:33.589 --> 00:33:35.146 align:middle line:84%
they'll use symbols
or attunements.

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:36.178 align:middle line:90%
We have no symbols.

00:33:36.178 --> 00:33:37.215 align:middle line:90%
We have no attunements.

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:39.484 align:middle line:84%
I'm not asking anybody
to believe anything.

00:33:39.484 --> 00:33:41.633 align:middle line:84%
You can be religious
or an atheist

00:33:41.633 --> 00:33:44.289 align:middle line:84%
or a spiritual without religion,
whatever you want to be.

00:33:44.289 --> 00:33:46.758 align:middle line:84%
I never even covered
that as a question.

00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:48.711 align:middle line:84%
I don't ask anybody
to accept or believe

00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:49.794 align:middle line:90%
anything I'm telling them.

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:52.692 align:middle line:84%
What I do ask them to do is
do the breathing and body

00:33:52.692 --> 00:33:54.566 align:middle line:84%
awareness exercises to
raise their vibration.

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:57.368 align:middle line:84%
They raise their vibration
high enough, the field,

00:33:57.368 --> 00:34:00.071 align:middle line:84%
the other person entrained
to their vibration

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:01.673 align:middle line:90%
and then the body heals itself.

00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:04.481 align:middle line:84%
So it's very different
than the other modalities

00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:05.543 align:middle line:90%
in that regard.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.945 align:middle line:84%
>> You were an atheist
prior to all of this.

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:08.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
That's where I started.

00:34:08.947 --> 00:34:09.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Talk about what happened.

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:11.316 align:middle line:90%
What was the transition for you?

00:34:11.316 --> 00:34:12.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Oh,
there were many transitions

00:34:12.964 --> 00:34:13.764 align:middle line:90%
in my path.

00:34:13.764 --> 00:34:18.283 align:middle line:84%
>> But essentially you were
a materialist and as you say

00:34:18.283 --> 00:34:19.824 align:middle line:90%
you're still a closet scientist?

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
Oh, I love science,

00:34:21.637 --> 00:34:25.948 align:middle line:84%
but more of the Rupert Sheldrake
variety I love the ideals

00:34:25.948 --> 00:34:28.814 align:middle line:84%
of science and that we can
really test things and check

00:34:28.814 --> 00:34:31.136 align:middle line:84%
them out and not to
come from the assumption

00:34:31.136 --> 00:34:34.204 align:middle line:84%
and the prejudice point of
view that says everything has

00:34:34.204 --> 00:34:36.174 align:middle line:90%
to have a material explanation.

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:39.309 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many spiritual
experiences in my life

00:34:39.309 --> 00:34:44.715 align:middle line:84%
that I can't deny the existence
of the infinite love and God

00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:46.151 align:middle line:90%
and whatever we call it.

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I just don't buy into religion.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I think of religion kind of
like the point of view of well,

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.826 align:middle line:84%
I think we understand
I'll just say it this way.

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:57.446 align:middle line:84%
I think we understand
spirituality

00:34:57.446 --> 00:34:59.831 align:middle line:84%
as well as a dust
mite understands

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:02.534 align:middle line:84%
the Library of Congress
that it's walking in.

00:35:02.534 --> 00:35:04.736 align:middle line:84%
It has no conception
of how deep it goes.

00:35:04.736 --> 00:35:08.392 align:middle line:84%
I think our love is
infinite because we're

00:35:08.392 --> 00:35:09.774 align:middle line:90%
connected to source.

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:13.511 align:middle line:84%
>> But the scientist part,
let's go back to that for just

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:16.381 align:middle line:84%
a moment because you're still,
even though you've seen this

00:35:16.381 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:84%
again thousands and
thousands, you have thousands

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.385 align:middle line:90%
of practitioners doing this.

00:35:20.385 --> 00:35:22.869 align:middle line:84%
You are on a bit of a
mission and that is you

00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:25.824 align:middle line:84%
want to prove this to the
world of science as well,

00:35:25.824 --> 00:35:30.387 align:middle line:84%
and so you're planning on
doing a wonderful experiment

00:35:30.387 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:90%
involving MRI technology.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah, what
we want to show is because this

00:35:34.827 --> 00:35:36.734 align:middle line:84%
physiological
untwisting of the hips,

00:35:36.734 --> 00:35:39.137 align:middle line:84%
which isn't really very
interesting to most people,

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:41.673 align:middle line:84%
but because it's considered
physiologically impossible,

00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:44.943 align:middle line:84%
we want to actually to
what's called 4D MRI,

00:35:44.943 --> 00:35:48.366 align:middle line:84%
which means it's an MRI movie
and we'll show the untwisting

00:35:48.366 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:90%
happening in movie form.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.416 align:middle line:84%
We can run it
forward and backward

00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:53.384 align:middle line:84%
and show it happening
in real time.

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:57.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Well and you, just before we
went on, you got a phone call

00:35:57.088 --> 00:36:00.358 align:middle line:84%
from someone saying possibly
the experiment's on.

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:03.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah,
he's got some leads to see

00:36:03.709 --> 00:36:07.700 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard for me being in
the healing capacity to call up

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.302 align:middle line:84%
radiologists and say, "Hey,
let's test something out,"

00:36:10.302 --> 00:36:13.699 align:middle line:84%
so I needed some assistance and
this chiropractor is helping me

00:36:13.699 --> 00:36:16.207 align:middle line:84%
open the door to
the radiologists.

00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:18.443 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're planning on
doing that hopefully soon.

00:36:18.443 --> 00:36:19.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, probably
within a month.

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:21.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Within a month, okay.

00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:24.249 align:middle line:84%
And then the scientists will
have their empirical evidence

00:36:24.249 --> 00:36:25.286 align:middle line:90%
they're looking for.

00:36:25.286 --> 00:36:27.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Exactly,
because I really believe

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:29.087 align:middle line:84%
in providing them
empirical evidence.

00:36:29.087 --> 00:36:32.223 align:middle line:84%
I don't ask anybody to
accept anything on faith.

00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet at the same time
our minds and our own beings,

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.063 align:middle line:84%
our own energy field, our
subconscious and the programing

00:36:39.063 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
in it do affect what's
going on in our body,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.736 align:middle line:84%
and even our own ability
to heal ourselves.

00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:47.759 align:middle line:84%
As you write about in your
book, some Quantum Touch

00:36:47.759 --> 00:36:50.608 align:middle line:84%
practitioners are more
proficient than others

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:52.944 align:middle line:90%
at healing themselves.

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:55.246 align:middle line:84%
And there are sometimes when
even healing someone else,

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:58.001 align:middle line:84%
if I can just extend that, you
can't get to it for very long.

00:36:58.001 --> 00:37:00.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: This
is a very important point.

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:02.553 align:middle line:84%
I cannot adjust my own
posture with energy.

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.155 align:middle line:90%
I've tried hundreds of times.

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:06.445 align:middle line:84%
Other people can do it
really easily and they said,

00:37:06.445 --> 00:37:08.092 align:middle line:84%
"Don't put your
limitations on us,"

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:09.426 align:middle line:90%
and I say, "Thank you very much.

00:37:09.426 --> 00:37:10.225 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it."

00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:11.863 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to
give you the idea

00:37:11.863 --> 00:37:14.866 align:middle line:84%
that energy healing is the
only important thing to do.

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:17.235 align:middle line:84%
There is the nutritional
element of it;

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:19.550 align:middle line:84%
exercise is really
important and most important

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.905 align:middle line:90%
is the emotional level.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:23.054 align:middle line:84%
And I have an entire
other modality

00:37:23.054 --> 00:37:25.390 align:middle line:84%
called Self Created Health
where I teach people

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.413 align:middle line:84%
how to find and process
the emotional causes.

00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:30.723 align:middle line:84%
Now, about 90
percent of the time

00:37:30.723 --> 00:37:33.702 align:middle line:84%
we're able to get at least
a symptomatic shift, if not

00:37:33.702 --> 00:37:37.382 align:middle line:84%
a long term shift, in health
condition, but what we do

00:37:37.382 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:84%
have from time to
time conditions

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.195 align:middle line:84%
that will not budge with energy
healing, and I respect that.

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:46.958 align:middle line:84%
If that isn't what's
called for, that isn't, you

00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:49.205 align:middle line:84%
know, the right tool for
the job, so I figured out

00:37:49.205 --> 00:37:52.937 align:middle line:84%
a way to help people find and
release the emotional cause.

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Now it takes about ten, fifteen
sometimes twenty minutes

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.309 align:middle line:84%
to find exactly what
the emotional cause is.

00:37:58.309 --> 00:38:01.446 align:middle line:84%
It isn't paint by numbers,
you know, this means this--

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:02.417 align:middle line:90%
>> And in 20 questions.

00:38:02.417 --> 00:38:04.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Actually,
there are a number of questions

00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:08.219 align:middle line:84%
that I ask but the answers
provide a three dimensional

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:11.061 align:middle line:84%
hologram of what the emotional
issue is that we're not dealing

00:38:11.061 --> 00:38:11.322 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course,
there's the release

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and then the third
step is the one

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.161 align:middle line:90%
that people get in trouble with.

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:21.532 align:middle line:84%
It's finding that
place within yourself

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:23.768 align:middle line:84%
where you really realize
that you hurt yourself.

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, people who jump to
step three and realize I

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.438 align:middle line:84%
create my reality,
I'm responsible,

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.438 align:middle line:84%
they just beat themselves
up because they

00:38:29.438 --> 00:38:30.441 align:middle line:90%
can't be responsible.

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.009 align:middle line:90%
It's too big a pill to swallow.

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:34.685 align:middle line:84%
But when people find
they've released

00:38:34.685 --> 00:38:37.815 align:middle line:84%
the intensity, the emotion, they
know exactly what the issue was

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.458 align:middle line:84%
and they've released
it, then they

00:38:39.458 --> 00:38:40.999 align:middle line:84%
realize that they've
hurt themselves,

00:38:40.999 --> 00:38:44.119 align:middle line:84%
then they can go into the
remorse and self forgiveness

00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:46.568 align:middle line:84%
and it turns into an
explosive self-love.

00:38:46.568 --> 00:38:49.193 align:middle line:84%
So, not only do the symptoms go
away, but people feel grateful.

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:52.833 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what a lot of
people don't get and don't want

00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:56.567 align:middle line:84%
and, for that reason, don't
want to explore really deeply

00:38:56.567 --> 00:39:00.004 align:middle line:84%
into the caverns of the
subconscious mind where all

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:02.952 align:middle line:84%
these experiences are held, is
that they fear they're going

00:39:02.952 --> 00:39:06.677 align:middle line:84%
to see something horrible about
themselves but isn't everybody.

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:09.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah, we
have this pain but the body has

00:39:09.515 --> 00:39:11.315 align:middle line:90%
the ability to be sick.

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:12.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:12.115 --> 00:39:14.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Not as a
dysfunction but a communication

00:39:14.573 --> 00:39:16.888 align:middle line:84%
from a higher self and
the reason for this is

00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:19.278 align:middle line:84%
because we're
connected to source,

00:39:19.278 --> 00:39:23.316 align:middle line:84%
our pain goes deeper than we
want to know but our love goes

00:39:23.316 --> 00:39:25.029 align:middle line:90%
deeper than we can know.

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:28.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: And so, when
we tap into these levels and we

00:39:28.989 --> 00:39:32.216 align:middle line:84%
hit that real core energy of
that depth of love of who we

00:39:32.216 --> 00:39:34.038 align:middle line:84%
are, not only do
symptoms go away,

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:36.741 align:middle line:84%
but people feel grateful
for having had the condition

00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:39.177 align:middle line:90%
and that's the deeper work.

00:39:39.177 --> 00:39:43.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because it creates a
knot in the entire being when

00:39:43.191 --> 00:39:44.916 align:middle line:84%
there are these
trapped emotions.

00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:47.385 align:middle line:84%
We have knots in our
relationships with others.

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:51.155 align:middle line:84%
There are boundaries; barriers
between real connections

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:53.267 align:middle line:84%
with others when we
feel that we have

00:39:53.267 --> 00:39:56.555 align:middle line:84%
these deep dark secrets about
how awful something in us is.

00:39:56.555 --> 00:39:58.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Or pain
that we just can't release

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:01.866 align:middle line:84%
or the problem and so what
happens is sometimes our higher

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:03.968 align:middle line:84%
self, I believe,
intervenes and says no,

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.439 align:middle line:84%
energy work is not the
answer to this question.

00:40:06.439 --> 00:40:07.939 align:middle line:84%
It's not the answer
to your problem.

00:40:07.939 --> 00:40:09.584 align:middle line:84%
You can eat
nutritionally, perfect

00:40:09.584 --> 00:40:11.709 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] and you still
have this thing going on.

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.857 align:middle line:84%
But when you release
those emotions...so,

00:40:13.857 --> 00:40:16.924 align:middle line:84%
the woman in the workshop, she
explained she couldn't stop

00:40:16.924 --> 00:40:18.924 align:middle line:84%
crying, she never felt
so much love in her life;

00:40:18.924 --> 00:40:21.091 align:middle line:84%
she never felt so grateful
in her whole life,

00:40:21.091 --> 00:40:23.955 align:middle line:84%
and now she loves her dad again
and so what condition triggered

00:40:23.955 --> 00:40:24.755 align:middle line:90%
all that?

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:25.857 align:middle line:90%
Well, my shoulder hurt.

00:40:25.857 --> 00:40:26.858 align:middle line:90%
And everybody laughs.

00:40:26.858 --> 00:40:28.893 align:middle line:84%
Well, the shoulder
is all completed.

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:32.163 align:middle line:84%
It's not even a problem, but
now she's taken herself back

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:34.665 align:middle line:84%
and that's the benefit of
the self created health,

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.235 align:middle line:84%
because when the energy
work isn't the answer,

00:40:37.235 --> 00:40:38.493 align:middle line:90%
we go to the emotional causes.

00:40:38.493 --> 00:40:39.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:39.293 --> 00:40:41.876 align:middle line:84%
You have in your
book also-- you were

00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:44.342 align:middle line:84%
talking about what
happened, my shoulder hurt.

00:40:44.342 --> 00:40:49.247 align:middle line:84%
You have in your book a
graphic of the human vertebrae

00:40:49.247 --> 00:40:52.298 align:middle line:84%
and what each organ
and part of the body

00:40:52.298 --> 00:40:54.485 align:middle line:84%
is associated with
each of the vertebrae.

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.654 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is fairly scientific.

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:59.757 align:middle line:84%
Do we need to know this in
order to do this healing?

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:02.960 align:middle line:84%
What is the advantage in
understanding ourselves

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.395 align:middle line:90%
on that level physiologically?

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:07.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: We have three
chapters in the book where we

00:41:07.071 --> 00:41:08.633 align:middle line:90%
go into a lot of physiology.

00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:11.313 align:middle line:84%
We have a big paragraph at the
beginning of the chapter that

00:41:11.313 --> 00:41:13.495 align:middle line:84%
says if you're not
interested in understanding

00:41:13.495 --> 00:41:16.274 align:middle line:84%
this depth of spirituality,
skip the chapter

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:17.675 align:middle line:90%
and just work generally.

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:19.835 align:middle line:84%
But for those people
who love really getting

00:41:19.835 --> 00:41:22.446 align:middle line:84%
that depth of understanding,
working specifically

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:26.979 align:middle line:84%
can be very useful, but if
you don't need to go there

00:41:26.979 --> 00:41:28.875 align:middle line:84%
we see miracles
happen with people

00:41:28.875 --> 00:41:31.123 align:middle line:84%
who have virtually no
physiological understanding

00:41:31.123 --> 00:41:31.923 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:41:31.923 --> 00:41:34.190 align:middle line:84%
The hip bone is connected
to the thigh bone and that's

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.526 align:middle line:90%
enough information for me.

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.864 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
better at sending,

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:42.166 align:middle line:84%
some are maybe better
at receiving or are

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:45.102 align:middle line:84%
we all what would
you say about that?

00:41:45.102 --> 00:41:48.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: I would say
that pretty much everybody has

00:41:48.702 --> 00:41:50.975 align:middle line:90%
the ability to feel love.

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:55.346 align:middle line:84%
Some people are more broken
and hurt than other people

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:58.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's all there, and as
people exercise that ability

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.017 align:middle line:90%
it opens up more for them.

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:03.955 align:middle line:84%
I remember one man commenting
I've forgotten I have a heart

00:42:03.955 --> 00:42:06.628 align:middle line:84%
and how deeply I know
how to love until I took

00:42:06.628 --> 00:42:08.549 align:middle line:84%
this workshop,
because it opens it up

00:42:08.549 --> 00:42:11.395 align:middle line:84%
and you realize he
had tears in his eyes.

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:14.675 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for helping me
open my heart again and find

00:42:14.675 --> 00:42:15.626 align:middle line:90%
this part of myself.

00:42:15.626 --> 00:42:16.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:16.426 --> 00:42:19.403 align:middle line:84%
I recently did a couple
of interviews on autism

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:21.472 align:middle line:84%
with Susie Miller
and William Tiller.

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:23.441 align:middle line:84%
I call it the Tiller
and Miller show right?

00:42:23.441 --> 00:42:26.811 align:middle line:84%
They're doing some amazing
experiments with consciousness

00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:29.072 align:middle line:84%
and its effect on
people that are

00:42:29.072 --> 00:42:31.532 align:middle line:84%
autistic, young children
who are autistic,

00:42:31.532 --> 00:42:32.777 align:middle line:90%
and it's quantifiable.

00:42:32.777 --> 00:42:33.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Beautiful.

00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:34.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:38.191 align:middle line:84%
And you have done some work
with healing touch and autism.

00:42:38.191 --> 00:42:40.524 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading in the
book there was some work done.

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:42.226 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:43.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah.

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:45.695 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
conditions that respond

00:42:45.695 --> 00:42:49.266 align:middle line:84%
to the work and some people are
working with autistic children

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:50.401 align:middle line:90%
and many other things.

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:53.104 align:middle line:90%
I remember one man.

00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:56.273 align:middle line:84%
This wife talked to the
judge, she was a social worker

00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:59.777 align:middle line:84%
and the baby was born with
severe fetal alcohol syndrome,

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:03.313 align:middle line:84%
addicted to amphetamines, 13
weeks premature, couldn't even

00:43:03.313 --> 00:43:04.315 align:middle line:90%
move its arms and legs.

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:09.754 align:middle line:84%
This little tiny shell of a baby
and they ran energy every day,

00:43:09.754 --> 00:43:12.923 align:middle line:84%
fed him good food, lots
of love, the baby thrived.

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.759 align:middle line:90%
Above average intelligence.

00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:16.927 align:middle line:84%
He was destined to
have a 20 to 40 IQ

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and be institutionalized
for life.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:22.233 align:middle line:84%
The child then
learned to see energy

00:43:22.233 --> 00:43:24.802 align:middle line:84%
and he sees the
energy in his hands.

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:27.182 align:middle line:84%
One day he banged
his head on the couch

00:43:27.182 --> 00:43:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and daddy is running energy
and he says, "That feels good,"

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.412 align:middle line:84%
as he stops crying, and he moves
his hands like this and daddy

00:43:32.412 --> 00:43:33.411 align:middle line:90%
says, "What do you see?"

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:34.631 align:middle line:90%
He says, "I see light."

00:43:34.631 --> 00:43:36.047 align:middle line:84%
He said, "What
does it look like?"

00:43:36.047 --> 00:43:37.381 align:middle line:90%
"It looks like flashlights."

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:38.916 align:middle line:90%
"Well, that's the energy."

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:41.042 align:middle line:84%
And then the child was
able to actually see

00:43:41.042 --> 00:43:42.420 align:middle line:90%
the colors of the chakras.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:47.435 align:middle line:84%
This is like so revolutionary
that you can take a child--

00:43:47.435 --> 00:43:48.726 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to ask you that.

00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:50.828 align:middle line:84%
Do you have children
practitioners?

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:54.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well, we've
had some I think the youngest

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:56.867 align:middle line:84%
practitioner instructor
that I met was 18 years old.

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:59.737 align:middle line:84%
>> But I mean are kids able
to do this on themselves,

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:00.847 align:middle line:90%
each other, their family?

00:44:00.847 --> 00:44:01.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Oh yeah.

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:03.607 align:middle line:90%
It is so inspiring.

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:06.277 align:middle line:84%
I remember an 11 year
old boy took the class.

00:44:06.277 --> 00:44:07.678 align:middle line:90%
He was so excited.

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:09.365 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You know,
I was secretly

00:44:09.365 --> 00:44:11.824 align:middle line:84%
wishing I had super human powers
and now I feel like I do."

00:44:11.824 --> 00:44:14.323 align:middle line:84%
So he goes to school the next
day and he says to his friend,

00:44:14.323 --> 00:44:16.380 align:middle line:84%
"You know, I've learned
how to help heal people."

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.421 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Well, heal me."

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:19.004 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Well, do
you hurt anywhere?"

00:44:19.004 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:90%
He says, "No."

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.038 align:middle line:84%
"Well, I could show you
better if you had something

00:44:22.038 --> 00:44:24.095 align:middle line:84%
[multiple speakers.]" So the kid
takes his own hand and slams it

00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:25.396 align:middle line:90%
on the table as hard as he can.

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:27.776 align:middle line:84%
His hand is turning
purple and so

00:44:27.776 --> 00:44:31.199 align:middle line:84%
the kid picks up the boys
hand, runs energy into it,

00:44:31.199 --> 00:44:35.906 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "Wow, that's so
cool," and he ran off to play.

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:37.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Doesn't it seem like
that should be part

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:40.144 align:middle line:84%
of our curriculum in
the human species?

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:43.364 align:middle line:84%
We should know about
things as simple

00:44:43.364 --> 00:44:46.170 align:middle line:84%
as our birthright of
being able to use our mind

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:48.419 align:middle line:84%
and our love to heal
ourselves and each other?

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:50.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: That's one
of my long standing desires,

00:44:50.835 --> 00:44:54.425 align:middle line:84%
to see this as standard
education in public schools.

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:57.743 align:middle line:84%
By the time a child
from kindergarten,

00:44:57.743 --> 00:45:00.915 align:middle line:84%
elementary school, all the
way up through high school,

00:45:00.915 --> 00:45:03.842 align:middle line:84%
graduates, they would
be profound, profound

00:45:03.842 --> 00:45:05.936 align:middle line:90%
practitioners of energy work.

00:45:05.936 --> 00:45:08.016 align:middle line:84%
Now the children have
a very pure energy.

00:45:08.016 --> 00:45:09.807 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to say
there are no filters,

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:10.941 align:middle line:90%
they haven't been taught to--

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:12.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: But they tend
to have a very short attention

00:45:12.995 --> 00:45:13.795 align:middle line:90%
span.

00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:15.904 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to get
a really good session,

00:45:15.904 --> 00:45:17.978 align:middle line:84%
you know, the seven
year old or six year old

00:45:17.978 --> 00:45:20.851 align:middle line:84%
is working on grandma's
headache and her knee pain

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:21.986 align:middle line:90%
and just doing miracles.

00:45:21.986 --> 00:45:26.056 align:middle line:84%
It's such an inspiring,
touching thing to see.

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:28.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes we can't heal
ourselves as well as we can

00:45:28.873 --> 00:45:31.370 align:middle line:84%
like you did earlier, you
can't work on your own spine,

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:33.330 align:middle line:84%
as well as we can
heal each other.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.813 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
occurs to me is perhaps

00:45:36.813 --> 00:45:42.266 align:middle line:84%
it's that quantum connectedness
to each other that

00:45:42.266 --> 00:45:43.574 align:middle line:90%
allows for this healing.

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.276 align:middle line:90%
It's the dynamic.

00:45:45.276 --> 00:45:48.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Consider if
you bought the most beautiful

00:45:48.056 --> 00:45:51.963 align:middle line:84%
gift and you wrapped it up and
you waited for the most perfect

00:45:51.963 --> 00:45:53.612 align:middle line:84%
moment, you didn't
care what it cost,

00:45:53.612 --> 00:45:57.055 align:middle line:84%
it's just beautiful and you wait
for that moment and you give it

00:45:57.055 --> 00:45:57.855 align:middle line:90%
to yourself.

00:45:57.855 --> 00:45:58.771 align:middle line:90%
Well it's no surprise.

00:45:58.771 --> 00:45:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: It's a little
bit like running water through

00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:02.726 align:middle line:90%
the same pipes.

00:46:02.726 --> 00:46:04.126 align:middle line:84%
It's not a surprise
to the system

00:46:04.126 --> 00:46:05.841 align:middle line:84%
but somebody else's
love to you, I've

00:46:05.841 --> 00:46:07.364 align:middle line:90%
never loved myself this way.

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:08.966 align:middle line:90%
It's a total surprise to me.

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.017 align:middle line:84%
So other people's
energy may be more

00:46:11.017 --> 00:46:13.744 align:middle line:84%
of a surprise to your
system, but some people

00:46:13.744 --> 00:46:16.400 align:middle line:84%
have a greater capacity
of caring for themselves

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.809 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to
effect themselves more,

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.958 align:middle line:84%
and that's why my
students say don't

00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:22.355 align:middle line:90%
put your limitations on us.

00:46:22.355 --> 00:46:24.771 align:middle line:84%
Just because you have trouble
doing this thing on yourself

00:46:24.771 --> 00:46:27.573 align:middle line:84%
Richard, don't tell us
that we can't because they

00:46:27.573 --> 00:46:29.286 align:middle line:90%
have had phenomenal success.

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:32.756 align:middle line:84%
And I hear stories about
people with really bad burns

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:35.693 align:middle line:84%
and they run energy to
themselves and minutes later,

00:46:35.693 --> 00:46:38.028 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes 20 minutes
later, it doesn't hurt

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:40.612 align:middle line:84%
and the redness disappears
and there's no scarring,

00:46:40.612 --> 00:46:44.168 align:middle line:84%
there's no, just all kinds of
wonderful stories taking place.

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:50.007 align:middle line:84%
The range of stories is so
wide, as to be just compelling.

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:53.117 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the situation,
we talked about this off camera

00:46:53.117 --> 00:46:56.785 align:middle line:84%
too, about the ability
to heal another when,

00:46:56.785 --> 00:47:00.668 align:middle line:84%
or facilitate healing, I think
that's a better way to say it,

00:47:00.668 --> 00:47:03.333 align:middle line:84%
in another person when there
is an emergency situation going

00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:06.030 align:middle line:84%
on, which I've certainly
participated in numerous

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:09.127 align:middle line:84%
occasions and you've heard about
the mother who lifts the car

00:47:09.127 --> 00:47:09.927 align:middle line:90%
off the child.

00:47:09.927 --> 00:47:13.131 align:middle line:84%
What's happening there and
then you can't necessarily --

00:47:13.131 --> 00:47:15.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: I've heard
this story so many times from

00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:19.803 align:middle line:84%
people who say, you know, this
person broke a bone and I was

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:22.136 align:middle line:84%
so inspired at that moment,
I didn't know anything about

00:47:22.136 --> 00:47:22.300 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.941 align:middle line:84%
I put my hand on it,
it was a miracle,

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.888 align:middle line:84%
but the next time I
tried to do it not only

00:47:25.888 --> 00:47:28.012 align:middle line:84%
did it not work but I
felt tired or drained.

00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Here is the deal.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.783 align:middle line:84%
When you are tapping into
that much love and desire

00:47:32.783 --> 00:47:35.085 align:middle line:84%
and passion, you just put
your hands on somebody,

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:36.720 align:middle line:84%
something amazing
is going to happen.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
not tapped in you

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:42.193 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to raise your
vibration to that level of love

00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:42.993 align:middle line:90%
and inspiration.

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:45.596 align:middle line:84%
That's why we teach the
breathing body awareness

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:50.811 align:middle line:84%
and heart exercises to lift
your vibration as high as if you

00:47:50.811 --> 00:47:52.770 align:middle line:90%
were the mom lifting the car.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.403 align:middle line:84%
That's why the people feel tired
or drained because when things

00:47:56.403 --> 00:47:58.028 align:middle line:84%
are vibrating in
different frequencies,

00:47:58.028 --> 00:48:00.140 align:middle line:84%
either you're going to lift
them up to your frequency

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to come
down to their frequency

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.914 align:middle line:90%
or you'll meet in the middle.

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:06.175 align:middle line:84%
A practitioner who's
doing really good work

00:48:06.175 --> 00:48:09.520 align:middle line:84%
will feel more energized
at the end of the day.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.989 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to go
see a healing practitioner,

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:14.725 align:middle line:84%
the one question to ask is how
do you feel after a long day?

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:17.709 align:middle line:84%
And if they say, "Oh,
I sacrificed myself

00:48:17.709 --> 00:48:19.657 align:middle line:84%
to help others," make a
different appointment.

00:48:19.657 --> 00:48:22.198 align:middle line:84%
But the person that says, "Oh,
my God, I'm so energized maybe

00:48:22.198 --> 00:48:25.146 align:middle line:84%
it takes me an hour or two
to relax and go ahead and go

00:48:25.146 --> 00:48:28.072 align:middle line:84%
to sleep," make your
appointment the last of the day.

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:30.805 align:middle line:84%
Be the last person they see
because your energy will

00:48:30.805 --> 00:48:31.942 align:middle line:90%
get stronger and stronger.

00:48:31.942 --> 00:48:34.262 align:middle line:84%
I've done demonstrations
after a major lecture where

00:48:34.262 --> 00:48:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll work on everybody
in the audience,

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.673 align:middle line:84%
give everybody two
minutes or something

00:48:38.673 --> 00:48:41.501 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working for like two,
three hours after the lecture

00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:43.353 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
big line of people,

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I just touch people and people
jump and go [inaudible].

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.188 align:middle line:84%
And some guy who teaches, who
studied with Chinese masters

00:48:50.188 --> 00:48:52.062 align:middle line:84%
at [inaudible] says,
"How are you doing this?

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:54.031 align:middle line:84%
You looked tired when
you gave the lecture

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.667 align:middle line:84%
and now you have more
energy than when you began."

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:59.503 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Yeah, because I'm
constantly drawing more energy

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:00.537 align:middle line:90%
in from the universe."

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:02.853 align:middle line:84%
He says, "But I studied
with masters who were

00:49:02.853 --> 00:49:04.141 align:middle line:90%
drained after 15, 20 minutes."

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:07.311 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're not
using our energy.

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:10.347 align:middle line:84%
We're pulling in that
universal life force energy

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:12.783 align:middle line:84%
and lifting ourselves
throughout the session.

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:16.647 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the most amazing
thing you've seen happen?

00:49:16.647 --> 00:49:17.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: I really--

00:49:17.855 --> 00:49:19.323 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean there's
so many, I know.

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:21.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
There are too many.

00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:24.395 align:middle line:84%
One thing that when I first
started doing the work,

00:49:24.395 --> 00:49:26.964 align:middle line:84%
and it was the most
amazing at that moment,

00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:31.068 align:middle line:84%
was seeing my friends brought
a bunny rabbit over to my house

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:33.971 align:middle line:84%
and was terrified because I
had to put it back in a box.

00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:37.074 align:middle line:84%
And I ran energy into it, it
was trembling in my hands.

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:39.676 align:middle line:84%
It stopped trembling and
flipped over on its back

00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:41.281 align:middle line:84%
and stretched its
arms and legs out

00:49:41.281 --> 00:49:43.981 align:middle line:90%
as I had my hands on its belly.

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:49.759 align:middle line:84%
I worked on woman that week
who had major osteoporosis who

00:49:49.759 --> 00:49:51.255 align:middle line:90%
was completely hunched over.

00:49:51.255 --> 00:49:53.097 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
done demonstrating

00:49:53.097 --> 00:49:55.204 align:middle line:84%
to a group of people
how it worked,

00:49:55.204 --> 00:49:56.627 align:middle line:90%
she was this very talk women.

00:49:56.627 --> 00:49:58.657 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking way up to
see her and her daughter

00:49:58.657 --> 00:50:02.851 align:middle line:84%
burst into the room, burst
out crying, oh my God

00:50:02.851 --> 00:50:04.101 align:middle line:90%
mommy is standing up straight.

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:07.571 align:middle line:84%
I was so shocked after
these kinds of experiences.

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It blew my mind because I just
had no place to believe this.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.345 align:middle line:84%
My teacher, Bob Rasmussen,
had a gall bladder attack

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:17.314 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
amputate his gall bladder.

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:19.924 align:middle line:84%
I drove down from Santa
Cruz to Los Angeles, spent

00:50:19.924 --> 00:50:21.651 align:middle line:84%
an hour and a
quarter with him, he

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:25.255 align:middle line:84%
had no problem with his gall
bladder for the next 14 years.

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:31.428 align:middle line:84%
When you see things happen that
are so amazing and surprising,

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:34.146 align:middle line:84%
I call them life
shock experiences,

00:50:34.146 --> 00:50:37.568 align:middle line:84%
and when I saw that I could
do it without touching,

00:50:37.568 --> 00:50:41.438 align:middle line:84%
that was another shocking
experience to me.

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:45.201 align:middle line:84%
It continues to this day
that from time to time

00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:49.734 align:middle line:84%
I will have these experiences
that are outside of my beliefs

00:50:49.734 --> 00:50:52.707 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I encourage
everybody to discover

00:50:52.707 --> 00:50:55.802 align:middle line:84%
is that we can find
that place where

00:50:55.802 --> 00:50:58.456 align:middle line:84%
the reality is more fascinating
and amazing than we ever

00:50:58.456 --> 00:50:59.256 align:middle line:90%
imagined.

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:00.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:02.599 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell just from
sitting across you when you're

00:51:02.599 --> 00:51:05.015 align:middle line:84%
doing your juju- when
you're doing your quantum

00:51:05.015 --> 00:51:08.098 align:middle line:84%
touch we had an experience just
before the show went on today.

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:11.902 align:middle line:84%
My doggie, Finbar, is
having some issues right now

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:15.701 align:middle line:84%
and you did a session sending
him love and you didn't tell me

00:51:15.701 --> 00:51:18.008 align:middle line:84%
you were sending it to
me at the same time,

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:20.324 align:middle line:84%
but as soon as you
started I could

00:51:20.324 --> 00:51:22.823 align:middle line:84%
feel this immense energy
coming into my chest

00:51:22.823 --> 00:51:27.122 align:middle line:84%
and up and through my mind
and it was the feeling that we

00:51:27.122 --> 00:51:28.185 align:middle line:90%
recognize as love.

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:30.854 align:middle line:84%
And you said, "Oh, by the way
I sent a little to you too."

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:33.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well, I knew
you needed it because you care

00:51:33.437 --> 00:51:34.992 align:middle line:84%
so much and you
wanted it too so.

00:51:34.992 --> 00:51:38.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes and that segues
into the subject of animals

00:51:38.362 --> 00:51:40.030 align:middle line:90%
and let's talk about that.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.970 align:middle line:84%
This is something you're
really passionate about,

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:47.588 align:middle line:84%
that we tend to think we have
domination over the animal

00:51:47.588 --> 00:51:49.173 align:middle line:90%
kingdom rather than dominion.

00:51:49.173 --> 00:51:51.041 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this for a bit.

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.245 align:middle line:90%
We have some time.

00:51:52.245 --> 00:51:54.578 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Yeah, the
material scientist believes

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:59.683 align:middle line:84%
that animals are nothing
more than mechanical robots.

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:03.053 align:middle line:84%
They have no consciousness,
so soul, no feelings,

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:07.103 align:middle line:84%
but anybody who's spent
any time around their pets

00:52:07.103 --> 00:52:10.470 align:middle line:84%
know that the animals have
tremendous love and emotion

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:16.206 align:middle line:84%
and we've seen so many
incredible sessions with even

00:52:16.206 --> 00:52:20.647 align:middle line:84%
wild animals, infants, people
under general anesthesia,

00:52:20.647 --> 00:52:23.990 align:middle line:84%
plants, fluids, everything
responds to the energy

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.908 align:middle line:90%
even minerals.

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.704 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to
change tourmalines.

00:52:26.704 --> 00:52:28.412 align:middle line:84%
I had this tourmaline
I thought was black

00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:30.080 align:middle line:84%
but it was actually
really dark green.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.381 align:middle line:90%
It's completely opaque.

00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:34.337 align:middle line:84%
I take it outside and I look
through a ten powered loop

00:52:34.337 --> 00:52:36.753 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't see any color
and over time, running energy

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.923 align:middle line:84%
into it, it just
completely lit up.

00:52:38.923 --> 00:52:39.723 align:middle line:90%
>> You're kidding.

00:52:39.723 --> 00:52:40.724 align:middle line:90%
Over what period of time?

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:42.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: A few years.

00:52:42.015 --> 00:52:42.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: It just
completely lit up and now

00:52:44.428 --> 00:52:45.262 align:middle line:90%
it's translucent.

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:47.345 align:middle line:84%
You put a flashlight on
its side and it lights up,

00:52:47.345 --> 00:52:50.200 align:middle line:84%
you can see it in the
sun and it's turned

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.636 align:middle line:90%
to gem quality in many places.

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:53.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:52:53.971 --> 00:52:54.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: It's not
completely across the board

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.506 align:middle line:90%
but it's all around there.

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:59.776 align:middle line:84%
But people have had so many
extraordinary experiences

00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:04.484 align:middle line:84%
where their animals I remember
a horse had cough and bone

00:53:04.484 --> 00:53:07.718 align:middle line:84%
problems where it's like the
horse is walking on its nail

00:53:07.718 --> 00:53:10.211 align:middle line:84%
and it can't stand up,
and if that happens

00:53:10.211 --> 00:53:12.705 align:middle line:84%
the horse lays down and the
organs collapse and the horse

00:53:12.705 --> 00:53:13.505 align:middle line:90%
dies.

00:53:13.505 --> 00:53:14.305 align:middle line:90%
It's fatal.

00:53:14.305 --> 00:53:15.695 align:middle line:84%
So this, one of
our practitioners

00:53:15.695 --> 00:53:18.830 align:middle line:84%
works on the horse and the horse
doesn't have cough and bone

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:19.630 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.933 align:middle line:84%
It just changes the
position of the bone.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.801 align:middle line:90%
There's so many ways.

00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:27.137 align:middle line:84%
People work on the cats
and dogs and the birds

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:31.187 align:middle line:84%
and because the love
doesn't differentiate

00:53:31.187 --> 00:53:36.680 align:middle line:84%
whether you're working on
these different conditions.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.843 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not just healing but
also performance and this is

00:53:39.843 --> 00:53:41.051 align:middle line:90%
something worth getting into.

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:43.220 align:middle line:90%
You live in Santa Monica.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.980 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
people that are,

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:48.594 align:middle line:84%
you know, competing in a really
tough world of show biz, actors

00:53:48.594 --> 00:53:51.546 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and
you work with them

00:53:51.546 --> 00:53:54.798 align:middle line:84%
in being able to draw
to them or pump up

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:56.633 align:middle line:84%
their levels of
love and magnetism

00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:59.136 align:middle line:84%
to the point it gives
them an edge in life.

00:53:59.136 --> 00:54:00.671 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about for a moment?

00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:01.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Absolutely.

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.604 align:middle line:84%
I remember one woman
was complaining she

00:54:03.604 --> 00:54:05.075 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get any acting jobs.

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:08.845 align:middle line:84%
So I showed her how to boost
the heart energy really big

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:12.418 align:middle line:84%
like it's a city
block and how to shift

00:54:12.418 --> 00:54:15.871 align:middle line:84%
her emotions on the issue
too and so she just walks

00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:17.354 align:middle line:90%
in and says, "Hey guys."

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that she's
prettier and it's not

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.819 align:middle line:84%
that she's a better
actor, it's just

00:54:21.819 --> 00:54:23.360 align:middle line:84%
they can't keep
their eyes off of her

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:28.098 align:middle line:84%
because her charisma is
just phenomenally large

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.076 align:middle line:90%
and she got the job.

00:54:29.076 --> 00:54:31.034 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Please don't
forget the little people,

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.703 align:middle line:84%
you know the ones
under five foot six."

00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:34.798 align:middle line:84%
>> When she's up there
on the big screen.

00:54:34.798 --> 00:54:36.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Well yeah.

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:37.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't this true
in everything though?

00:54:37.672 --> 00:54:40.711 align:middle line:84%
If you can harness that energy
and breathe it through you

00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and pump up that heart
energy and the being,

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:47.484 align:middle line:84%
it can move mountains in pretty
much any area of life can't it?

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:49.698 align:middle line:84%
I mean really this is
just a universal energy

00:54:49.698 --> 00:54:50.775 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:54:50.775 --> 00:54:52.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
Well, like Chris says,

00:54:52.483 --> 00:54:54.039 align:middle line:84%
we're discovering
all of the apps,

00:54:54.039 --> 00:54:56.976 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of hundreds
of applications that

00:54:56.976 --> 00:55:01.331 align:middle line:84%
we're discovering, that we can
help performers really focus

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:05.701 align:middle line:84%
in and shift their charisma
and become much more appealing

00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:07.003 align:middle line:90%
to look at on stage.

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:10.907 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is when you
are in front of an audience

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:13.715 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling yourself
contracted and oh, my God

00:55:13.715 --> 00:55:16.313 align:middle line:84%
I have to speak to a
hundred or a thousand people

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:19.449 align:middle line:84%
and I'm getting really scared,
what's happening to your field?

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.586 align:middle line:84%
You've gone into fetal position
and you're holding it in.

00:55:22.586 --> 00:55:25.130 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is start including

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:28.847 align:middle line:84%
the first row in your
field and then bring it

00:55:28.847 --> 00:55:31.959 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to
the extreme audience

00:55:31.959 --> 00:55:35.616 align:middle line:84%
and then open up your heart
and feel yourself filling

00:55:35.616 --> 00:55:37.861 align:middle line:84%
the whole room with
that heart energy,

00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:39.795 align:middle line:84%
and now they're your
friends, they're

00:55:39.795 --> 00:55:42.138 align:middle line:84%
no longer alienated
because what happens

00:55:42.138 --> 00:55:44.998 align:middle line:84%
is we contract when
we're afraid and we

00:55:44.998 --> 00:55:46.309 align:middle line:90%
expand when we're feeling good.

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So you start opening
up and that's

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.251 align:middle line:84%
one of the tricks I use
to show the actors how

00:55:51.251 --> 00:55:53.879 align:middle line:84%
to build their charisma,
is how to expand

00:55:53.879 --> 00:55:55.252 align:middle line:90%
the heart energy really wide.

00:55:55.252 --> 00:55:59.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes and the reality is
that love trumps fear so again

00:55:59.362 --> 00:56:01.100 align:middle line:90%
you're going right back to love.

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Exactly.

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:04.208 align:middle line:84%
>> Bringing the feelings
of love into the being

00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:05.028 align:middle line:90%
and into the body.

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.396 align:middle line:90%
And there's one final thing.

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:07.898 align:middle line:84%
We just have a
couple minutes left.

00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:09.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Okay.

00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:13.453 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is when, when you do
this we often feel like either

00:56:13.453 --> 00:56:16.206 align:middle line:84%
self we won't try it because
we feel self conscious.

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:17.474 align:middle line:90%
Gee, what if it doesn't work?

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:18.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard Gordon: Right.

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And you say something toward
the end of the book that I

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:25.455 align:middle line:84%
think is really, it's a very
important part and that is it

00:56:25.455 --> 00:56:28.452 align:middle line:84%
is not your responsibility
to heal another.

00:56:28.452 --> 00:56:31.188 align:middle line:84%
If you can just take our last
minute and talk about that.

00:56:31.188 --> 00:56:32.522 align:middle line:90%
So it takes the burden off us.

00:56:32.522 --> 00:56:34.691 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God I failed, you know?

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:37.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: Well,
as I said, the healer has-

00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:41.965 align:middle line:84%
by definition- is the one
who was sick and got well.

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:44.503 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to hold
a field of energy

00:56:44.503 --> 00:56:47.404 align:middle line:84%
and to hold it within
pack ability and love.

00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And to continue raising that
field throughout the session,

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.043 align:middle line:90%
it is their job to get well.

00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:56.813 align:middle line:84%
So if I do my best and I'm
holding the field really well

00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:58.949 align:middle line:84%
and they respond well,
that's fantastic,

00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:01.184 align:middle line:84%
and if they don't,
that's not my job.

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:02.919 align:middle line:90%
My job is holding the field.

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:05.689 align:middle line:90%
Their job is getting well.

00:57:05.689 --> 00:57:07.123 align:middle line:90%
>> So don't beat ourselves up.

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:08.992 align:middle line:84%
Just yet another
negative on the chart.

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:11.305 align:middle line:84%
Don't beat ourselves up if
the person isn't responding

00:57:11.305 --> 00:57:13.163 align:middle line:90%
the way we had hoped.

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:16.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon: The bottom
line is our love is truly

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:18.668 align:middle line:90%
valuable and has impact.

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:19.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:57:19.763 --> 00:57:21.471 align:middle line:84%
Richard, thank you so
much for your time.

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for working
on my doggie Finbar

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:27.744 align:middle line:84%
and for sharing all
of this information.

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:30.080 align:middle line:84%
You're right, it has to
go into the curriculum.

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.781 align:middle line:90%
That has to be what's up next.

00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:33.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard Gordon:
Thank you so much.

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:34.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.275 align:middle line:84%
I hope this has inspired
the healer in you.

00:57:36.275 --> 00:57:38.755 align:middle line:84%
You can find Richard's book
"Quantum Touch 2.0 The New

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Human" at any major bookseller.

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:43.293 align:middle line:84%
I have seen, experienced
and conducted this kind

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:45.746 align:middle line:84%
of healing first hand and
I can say without a doubt

00:57:45.746 --> 00:57:49.032 align:middle line:84%
that all of us have the
ability to heal if we choose.

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:51.902 align:middle line:84%
Until next time thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
