>>REGINA MEREDITH: Would
you be surprised to know

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:10%
that 1/3 of the population
in the United States

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:10%
is in a pre-diabetic condition?

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And did you know
that high blood sugar

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
is implicated in the onset of
dementia and Alzheimer's, heart

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
disease, even premature
wrinkling of the skin?

Dr. John Douillard
is an evangelist

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:10%
for bringing down the
public's blood sugar levels

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:10%
and establishing a healthy
standard of living that

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.045 align:middle line:10%
eliminates the associated
problems of high blood sugar.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:10%
He's with us today to give us
some straight facts on what

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:10%
we can do to help ourselves.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.705 align:middle line:90%
And we all know about diabetes.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
We know people who have it.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.209 align:middle line:90%
They have to stick themselves.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.520 align:middle line:84%
They can go into a coma
if it goes too far.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:90%
But most people don't know.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.662 align:middle line:84%
You're talking, what, 90
million, 100 million people?

00:01:11.662 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another
stat, 90% of them

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:84%
don't even know
they have it, right?

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: That's right.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:10%
That's 90 million people are
walking around today as adults

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:10%
with pre-diabetes and they
don't know they have it.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.500 align:middle line:10%
And the problem is that when
you go for your annual checkup,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:10%
the doctor screens you
for your blood sugar.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:10%
And the normal range
for blood sugar

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:10%
is about 75 to 100
milligrams per deciliter

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:10%
on your blood test.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you're over 100,
you're a pre-diabetic.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
If you're over 126,
you're a type 2 diabetic.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
labs out there that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
are still not screening you at
all until you're 118 or 110.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.852 align:middle line:84%
And studies have shown that
the damage of diabetes--

00:01:53.852 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk
about what that is--

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.895 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't start just at 100.

00:01:56.895 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
There was one study that
showed, if your numbers are just

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
over 85, you're at a 40%
increased risk of dying

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:90%
of a heart attack or stroke.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's a bunch of people
that between 85 and 100.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, 1/3 of the American
population is over 100.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Over 100.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So what percentage of the
population is at 85 to 100?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: They did a study
with 43,000 non-diabetic men,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.328 align:middle line:90%
and 80% of them were over 85.

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So most of us are
really sitting on the edge?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Who's left, really?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And this
is really an epidemic.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.022 align:middle line:84%
The experts believe the
next 10 years, everybody,

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
all American adults
will be pre-diabetic,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.095 align:middle line:84%
but there's issues
taking place right now.

00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
an interview

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
I did about seven
years ago, and that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
was the prognosis that
most of the population

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
was going to be pre-diabetic
and a much higher percentage

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.282 align:middle line:84%
than now slipping into a state
of full-on type 1 diabetes.

00:02:44.282 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That's
actually right.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
first of all, I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
would think that the symptoms
would be fairly obvious,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:90%
but you're saying they're not.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:90%
What are the symptoms?

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: They
are and they are not.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
When this study came out
two years ago from the CDC,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I sourced these
hospital-approved blood

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
sugar monitors so that I can
give them to my patients,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
they could take it home, and
they can check their own blood

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:90%
sugar.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And these are very
healthy people generally,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and their blood sugars
were 110, 120, 130.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them full-blown type 2
diabetics and they had no idea.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the symptoms
of diabetes are insidious,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.477 align:middle line:84%
and what happens
is on the inside.

00:03:22.477 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing, when
that blood sugar starts

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
to rise after a dessert
or after a Coca-Cola, when

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
those numbers start to rise
in your blood a little bit,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that happens
is the muscles, which

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
are the big gas
guzzlers for your sugar,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
they just go, I can't
take any more sugar.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want
to think about it.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:90%
So then it stays in your blood.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
The first thing it does
is converts directly

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
into fat, belly fat,
hip fat, arm fat.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it converts directly
into LDL cholesterol, which

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:90%
is damaging for your arteries.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And number three,
the worst of all,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:90%
is what's called glycation.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The sugar in your blood attaches
to proteins in your blood

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:90%
and clumps your blood.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.480 align:middle line:84%
It's particularly fond of
two very important proteins,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
collagen and elastin,
which makes our skin look

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:90%
nice and youthful.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't only make us
look old and aged and wrinkled

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
on the outside, but it's the
skin on the inside that's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:90%
most important.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
When your arteries
start to wrinkle

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.332 align:middle line:84%
and your intestinal mucosa
and your intestinal tract

00:04:20.332 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
starts to wrinkle,
your respiratory tract

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:84%
starts to wrinkle, we've
got some severe problems.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And what happens, when that
glycation begins to happen,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
it's the number one cause
of cardiovascular disease.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:90%
It damages your arteries.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So the number one killer in
America today is heart disease.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The number one cause
of heart disease

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.033 align:middle line:84%
is this insidious blood
sugar pre-diabetic impact.

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, now,
that's not something

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.783 align:middle line:90%
you hear about that often.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We only hear about cholesterol
and some other obvious things

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
the medical industry
passes on to us.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.275 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And this is
the cause of that, really.

00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I remember years ago
doing an interview

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
with Udo Erasmus who wrote
the book "Fats That Heal,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Fats That Kill."

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Fantastic book.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fantastic.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And Udo was explaining to
me that it was not the fat

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.763 align:middle line:84%
that we eat in our
diet, it was the sugars

00:05:06.763 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and the simple carbohydrates
we eat in our diet that

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:90%
were killing us.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was completely
counter to everything

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
going on if you look at the
food pyramid, cut out the fats,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle line:90%
cut out the fats.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of that
thinking is changing,

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about the whole
cycle of simple carbohydrates

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
versus, we'll just start
with, versus fats and proteins

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and what it's doing
to our insulin levels.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well, the
simple carbohydrates

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
are the refined sugars and the
white table sugar, for example.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
We think white table sugar is
the worst thing in the world.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's interesting is the
glycemic index of white table

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:90%
sugar is about a 59.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
This is how quickly the
sugar gets into your blood.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
The glycemic index of
organic whole wheat bread

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
that you buy from the grocery
store that will actually

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
sit on your counter for
three weeks or a month

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
without going bad, basically
put bakers out of business--

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
not real food anymore.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Remember, bakers
used to make bread every day?

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well,
they don't have

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
to do that anymore
because they have

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:middle line:84%
this one-month-long
lasting bread.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the glycemic index of
whole wheat organic bread

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
in the grocery
story is about a 75.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Higher than
a tablespoon of sugar?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.492 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: You're better
off having white table sugar

00:06:12.492 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:90%
because it goes in that fast.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
The glycemic index of
a sprouted grain bread,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
the one you would get in the
refrigerated section that

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:84%
literally goes bad in two
days on the counter, is a 39.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the sugars,
it's the hidden sugars,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's the processed
nature of our foods

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
that made the glycemic
index of these foods

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
so fast that they
explode into your blood,

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and our body just don't
know what to do with it.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of
the first things

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that people do
feel, but they may not

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
know what to put it
down to, is this sense

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.945 align:middle line:84%
of a lack of focus
mentally, for example.

00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:46.745 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:06:46.745 --> 00:06:49.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it seems for
me, if I'm eating poorly,

00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:52.305 align:middle line:84%
my brain seems to recognize
it almost instantly.

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because it's not
necessarily some of the things

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:90%
you would think it would be.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well, there's
some really good research

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that Alzheimer's is sometimes
called diabetes of the brain.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And the same enzyme
that we have that actually

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
takes the plaque
out of the brain

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
to protect us from Alzheimer's
is the exact same enzyme

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that takes the sugar out
of the blood in the brain.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So if your enzyme
is now so constantly

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed with
taking the sugar out

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:84%
of the blood to
protect the brain,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:90%
it's going to leave the plaque.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the leading
causes of Alzheimer's, at least

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the leading
theories with regard

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:84%
to Alzheimer's today is actually
that we have too much sugar

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:90%
in the blood.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So if the getting wrinkled
doesn't it scare you

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:84%
or getting heart disease
doesn't scare you--

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Losing
your mind should.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: --that
should definitely get you.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we also notice
a drop in our overall energy

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
level, for example, if
we're riding that high.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And would you say that
everybody's tolerance

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:90%
is wired differently that way?

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people can eat what
appears to be very abusively

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and not seem to feel anything.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well, everybody
has a different constitution,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and I think we have
this roller coaster

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
ride that begins to
brew, particularly

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:90%
in our American culture.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
still eat this way

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.620 align:middle line:84%
where they have a cup
of coffee in the morning

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and they get off, and they
race to work, and bam!

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And a bagel.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: And a bagel.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And then they go up, and
that's all just pure sugar.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
The bagel sugar is
a 77 glycemic index.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:90%
The coffee just injects you.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.895 align:middle line:84%
Then around 10
o'clock it crashes

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and you need another cup of
coffee to get you back up.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Then you start crashing.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And you've been
gaining some weight

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
so you don't want
to eat a big lunch.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
have a big launch

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.425 align:middle line:84%
so you have a salad in front
of your computer with a Coke

00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
or a Diet Coke, and of course,
that just injects your sugar up

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:90%
even more.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Then at 3 o'clock
in the afternoon,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
you're crashing and
burning, so they

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
start passing dark chocolate
around, and that gets you up

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and you feel a little
better, and the blood sugar

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:90%
starts to come up again.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to drive
home, and your blood sugar

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is now crashing because
it's all up and down.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.392 align:middle line:84%
Sugar is a short-lived
energy supply.

00:08:41.392 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:84%
And then at 4:00 you
have to drive home,

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.095 align:middle line:84%
so you have to hit Starbucks
to get some energy to get home.

00:08:46.095 --> 00:08:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And you've been going
like this all day long.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
The body is so stressed out
that it needs a glass of wine

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:90%
to settle itself down.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And when the highs and
lows, and the body's

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
constantly unable to
stabilize its own blood sugar,

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
the body's response to
that emergency response

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.052 align:middle line:84%
is to store fat and
create more sugar,

00:09:04.052 --> 00:09:05.260 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we have done.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And the food industry
has served us well.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just provided quicker,
faster versions of food

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.282 align:middle line:90%
so we eat that constantly.

00:09:12.282 --> 00:09:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've
always attended,

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.448 align:middle line:84%
throughout my lifetime,
I think I learned

00:09:15.448 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
the entire caloric table
by the time I was 15

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.390 align:middle line:84%
because I did not want to
become overweight in life.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I was looking at it
as a pure caloric burner.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can take 1,200,
1,500, 2,000 calories,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and they're quantitatively
very different

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.273 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how you're going
to store fat on the body.

00:09:38.273 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It's sort of
how quickly those calories

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.675 align:middle line:90%
get into your bloodstream.

00:09:41.675 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And if they get
in really quickly

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.685 align:middle line:84%
and that surges your blood, your
body's going to go, [GASPS],,

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:90%
this is an emergency.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get this
sugar out of my blood

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:90%
and get it out quick.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So depending on
how you're wired,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
it will convert it to fat or to
cholesterol or it will glycate,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
or it will actually affect
your brain chemistry.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More so than the
actual number of calories

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:90%
that your body's taking in.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us have
really sluggish--

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
see, the wear and tear
of the blood sugars

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
going high and low, it
creates a major impact

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
on your ability to digest
food, so you don't eliminate

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:90%
as well as you once did.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't digest hard-to-digest
foods as well as you once did.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I have so many patients
now, in Boulder, Colorado,

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:84%
if you are found eating
gluten, they give you a ticket.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like illegal to eat gluten
in Boulder now because it's

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
become such a
terrible taboo food,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's really not
the gluten that's bad.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:84%
When they were 18-year-old,
people could eat the gluten.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But now, as we get older, we
lose the digestive strength,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.975 align:middle line:84%
and now we don't digest
hard-to-digest foods,

00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:90%
so we don't eat them.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We take them out of our
diet and we feel better.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that the
toxins in our environment

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:90%
are also hard to digest.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So you can take the
hard-to-digest foods out

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
of your diet, but you
can't take the toxins.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And your digestive
system is also

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:90%
your detoxification system.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So we can navigate
around the food,

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:84%
but the environmental
toxins we have to process.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
signposts of being

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:84%
a good detoxifier in a toxic
world that's so critical

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.795 align:middle line:90%
is being a good digester.

00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been
going down the road,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
well, I can't eat wheat, I can't
eat dairy, I can't eat greasy,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:84%
fried food-- and
nobody's saying you

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.785 align:middle line:84%
need to eat any of
those foods, but you

00:11:12.785 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
should be able to as a
measure of your ability

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
to be a good digester and
therefore a good detoxifier.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
that all of us

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
can have the digestive
system of an 18-year-old.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to, as we
age, become lousy digesters.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I just don't buy into that, and
I treat that with my patients

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.480 align:middle line:84%
on a regular basis, and I write
about that in my newsletters

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a great
newsletter, by the way.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So many doctors
and naturopaths are so about,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:90%
you're getting old.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Your digestive days are over.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.020 align:middle line:90%
You need enzymes.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.700 align:middle line:90%
You need all these probiotics.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And not to say that
they are not useful,

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
but when we become dependent
on these pills or powders

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
to digest, I think
it's a red flag.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, a few ways to go here.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of them, you were
talking about Boulder.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.475 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
issuing citations

00:11:59.475 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:90%
for gluten and for body fat.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yes.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think this has to be
the lowest body fat per capita

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:84%
of any place, certainly in the
Western world, in the developed

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.282 align:middle line:90%
nations, is Boulder.

00:12:12.282 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the
same time, what I'm

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.782 align:middle line:84%
hearing from some of the
people and practitioners

00:12:15.782 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and a doctor such as yourself,
we haven't talked about it,

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.167 align:middle line:84%
is that still, you're finding
high levels of blood sugar

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the clients,
even though they're

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.235 align:middle line:90%
down to almost zero body fat.

00:12:25.235 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well,
they eat foods

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:90%
that they think are healthy.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I had one patient
that recently came in,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and her blood sugars were high,
higher than they should be.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've looked at
her diet, and I said,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:90%
do you eat dried fruit?

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, yes,
I love dried fruit.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:90%
It's very healthy for you.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example, if you
take a mango, a regular mango,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
it's about 13 grams of sugar
off the vine, off the tree.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%
If you take that and dry it and
take the same amount of mango,

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:90%
it's 76 grams of sugar.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:90%
From 13 to 76.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sure,
it's concentrated.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So that's what
happens when we concentrate

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
our foods with dried fruit.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.135 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, I'm juicing, and I
juice my apples and my carrots

00:13:03.135 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:90%
and my beats every morning.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.677 align:middle line:84%
Well, apples and
carrots and beets

00:13:05.677 --> 00:13:08.102 align:middle line:84%
are high starchy foods
and full of sugar.

00:13:08.102 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you juice them,
you extract the sugar,

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.977 align:middle line:84%
and now you're ingesting--
many times, people,

00:13:11.977 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that's all they have for
breakfast is this explosion

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:90%
into their bloodstream.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, they are healthy sugars
from the point of view

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
of they're natural,
but it's still sugar.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Agave is still sugar.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Honey.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:90%
I have bees.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I love honey, but
it's still sugar.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And just because we are moving
to these natural sweets,

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Pomegranate juice, 8 ounces of
pomegranate, 30 grams of sugar.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
That's 10 teaspoons of white
table sugar out of the jar.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's shocking.

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:40.103 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:13:40.103 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And we think pomegranate
juice is good for your heart

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and many things,
but we were supposed

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:90%
to chew that pomegranate seed.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:90%
When we were born or--

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.064 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you would've
had the fiber and everything

00:13:49.064 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: That's right.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And it comes in slower.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But we're so fast-paced
and processing everything.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to chew
our food anymore, really.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:90%
These days, chewing is--

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Optional?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.527 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah, optional.

00:14:01.527 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:90%
It's labor intensive.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:90%
It takes so long.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It takes too long.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I just want to
drink my breakfast and go,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:90%
and that's a big problem.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you
brought up juicing,

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
I'd be able to--

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able to drive to
work if I juiced in the morning

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
because it spikes the
blood sugar so high,

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't even think
straight juicing.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know
a lot of other people,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.800 align:middle line:84%
it's the same way,
but this is really

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
one of the backbones
to a raw diet,

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
for example, is
a lot of juicing.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't have to be, but it is.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Backbones
to a healthy diet.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
People think it's
really healthy.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.528 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:14:31.528 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And now let's get into a
little bit of the raw factor

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
because I want to start
distinguishing in these treats

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that we like to
indulge in in life.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're now eating raw
or predominantly raw,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and one of our interviewees,
who is also someone I know well,

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:90%
is a queen of raw desserts.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you grind
up your almonds,

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:90%
and your whatever other nuts--

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I think she uses pine nuts and
walnuts-- in with some dates,

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and make a little paste,
and there's your crust.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Now that's dominantly
fats and protein.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
The ratio of dates is
actually still pretty small.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Then you put in
your coconut milk

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.955 align:middle line:84%
that's been all
whipped up with, maybe,

00:15:07.955 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:84%
just a small amount of
maple syrup, for example,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and your chia
seeds and all that.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a lot of fat,
we have some proteins going on

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.102 align:middle line:90%
and some sugars.

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Would that be
considered, if you're

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
going to treat yourself,
a healthy spectrum or not

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:90%
necessarily?

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: The
glycemic load is what

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:90%
you eat with the whole meal.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
If you have a balanced
meal, and then you

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
have that on top of it, it's
generally going to be OK.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But most people, nowadays,
in the name of good health,

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:90%
we don't eat balanced meals.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think a salad
is a good, healthy meal.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Now my mom would never
just serve me a salad,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, here, honey,
here's your lunch.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a salad.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That never
would've happened.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.495 align:middle line:84%
Never would they give you
a glass of juice and say,

00:15:50.495 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that's breakfast, on your way.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It was always a protein,
a starch, and a vegetable.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And we don't do that any longer.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
blood sugar issues,

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
the key, number one key, is
to stabilize your blood sugar

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:90%
with balanced meals.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Now in the beginning, eating a
little bit less carbohydrates

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:90%
and starches makes good sense.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you do that excessively--
in the whole no-carb world that

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.857 align:middle line:90%
we live in--

00:16:12.857 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that carbs have been deemed
so bad for us, from Atkins--

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
brain needs those.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Just with serotonin
production, don't we need it?

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: The
brain needs sugar.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:90%
They're long-lasting sugars.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:90%
They're very important.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.123 align:middle line:84%
And see, if you
don't have any carbs,

00:16:24.123 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:84%
your body's going to get
its energy from fat, right?

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And we lose weight,
and everybody feels great.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:90%
That was the Atkins model.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:29.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Happy.

00:16:29.485 --> 00:16:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.217 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: The
problem with that

00:16:31.217 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
is that when you go
into fat metabolism,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.060 align:middle line:84%
the body creates a lot of
ketones, which is actually

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
a chemical that your body has
to process through the kidneys.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And long-term, low carbohydrate,
high protein, high fat diets

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.662 align:middle line:84%
can actually damage
your kidneys.

00:16:47.662 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:84%
In the end, the
last thing you want

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:84%
to do in the name of good health
is create another problem.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we do when
we go into these extreme ways

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:90%
of eating.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wasn't that the case
with some of the Atkins diet?

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That's
exactly what happened.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People had
a lot of that problem.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Gall bladder.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yep.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the main reasons
why it fell out of favor

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.827 align:middle line:84%
was because there was a lot
of reports of kidney problems,

00:17:04.827 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and that scares people, and
it should, and rightfully so.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:90%
So it's about balance.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It all comes
back to that, doesn't it?

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we
are out of balance.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: We
are out of balance.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're
following every fad.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
If we tend to follow whatever
the latest gurus, health

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.087 align:middle line:84%
guru, food diet
guru's book is, we

00:17:23.087 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
are going to be out of balance
for the most part, right?

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Because
these diets tend to just--

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:90%
they last for about five years.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, when we
had the Pritikin diet,

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.418 align:middle line:84%
Pritikin basically said, you
can eat 80% carbohydrates,

00:17:38.418 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and lose weight, feel
good, and everything.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no fats.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So then,
all of a sudden,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
everybody's blood sugar
started going crazy

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
because they're eating
lots of sugars--

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:90%
80% carbohydrates.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Per capita,
didn't we go up

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
something like 12% over
that decade where that was

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.900 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the food pyramid?

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right, exactly.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
really his message.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.348 align:middle line:84%
His message was
more balanced food.

00:17:56.348 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But we hear 80% carbs, and the
food industry hears 80% carbs,

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.127 align:middle line:84%
it becomes short-chain,
quick, fast-moving carbs

00:18:02.127 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:90%
injected into blood sugar.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:90%
And then we have hypoglycemia.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.333 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And
then the hypoglycemia

00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
created stress, which caused
cholesterol levels to rise

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:90%
and shoot up like crazy.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we blamed
it on animal fats.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.112 align:middle line:84%
So then margarine and all these
crazy fad diets came into play.

00:18:16.112 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
saying, hey, you know what?

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:84%
The blood sugar's wacky, this
is a real serious problem,

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:84%
so we should eat
six meals a day.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Now America started grazing.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Every two to three hours, we're
eating little, tiny meals.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Now let me ask you something.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
If you want your
body to burn fat,

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
it makes good sense
to give it a reason.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you have breakfast, snack,
lunch, snack, supper, snack,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.572 align:middle line:84%
when does your
body burn its fat?

00:18:37.572 --> 00:18:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Compared to if you
have breakfast--

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When you're sleeping?

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Well--

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's about it?

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That's
the number one

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:84%
problem is that when people are
used to having meals every two

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to three hours, then
they go to bed and go,

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:84%
now we're going to sleep
for eight or nine hours,

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.247 align:middle line:90%
the body goes, what?

00:18:49.247 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to being
fed every two hours.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:90%
I need some food.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:90%
So they wake up hungry.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.580 align:middle line:84%
The second cause of
insomnia in America

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.732 align:middle line:90%
is blood sugar instability.

00:18:59.732 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't think most
people know that.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: No.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have to give
the body a reason

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to be a good fat burner,
and not just to lose weight.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Fat is calm fuel.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It's stable fuel.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not emergency fuel.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
It's sleep-through-the-night
fuel.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.400 align:middle line:90%
It's your detoxifying fuel.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It neutralizes the
acidity in your body

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
from all the stress that
makes your body toxic

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and degenerative.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you want your body
to burn fat-- and we do,

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:90%
for lots of reasons--

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:90%
you have to give it a reason.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Breakfast, nothing till lunch.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.968 align:middle line:84%
In between breakfast
and lunch, you burn fat.

00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
If you have a carrot
between breakfast and lunch,

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:90%
you're going to burn the carrot.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's the healthy meal.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle line:90%
Carrots are good for you.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're not
going to burn the fat.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.365 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Not that meal.

00:19:38.365 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:84%
From lunch to supper,
I have an apple.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, an apple's
good for you, but I

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:90%
didn't burn my fat that day.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And from supper all the way
to breakfast, we burn fat.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Now when I was a kid,
we had supper at 5:30.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:90%
6 o'clock, kitchen was closed.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Went out, kicked the
can, come back, play,

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
wake up at 7 o'clock,
and have breakfast.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.907 align:middle line:84%
That was 13 hours of our
day fasting, no food.

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
That would be like social
services knocking on your door

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and say, excuse me, Mrs.
Johnson, you're fasting.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:90%
You're starving your children.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:90%
You can't be doing that.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
You gotta feed your
kids every three hours.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:90%
It's America.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Gotta feed them.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that's
how we were raised.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't see
obese kids either.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: No, you didn't.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: None of our
friends had obesity.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I usually say, you're
out playing after dinner.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Attention deficit,
asthma, all these issues,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:90%
we just didn't see it.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So the ability to
be good fat burners

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to make
energy last and be stable,

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.527 align:middle line:90%
and that creates a stable mood.

00:20:25.527 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's something we
don't have in this country

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:90%
either is stable mood.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's gone wacky,
and depressed, and anxious.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Can't
handle stress any longer.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:32.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a big deal.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're on a
drug to manage your moods.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Exactly.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I noticed that a
lot of people that are trying

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.237 align:middle line:84%
to burn the fat, have
gone away from the carbs--

00:20:42.237 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:90%
we've seen a lot of this--

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
but there seems to
be these periods

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.980 align:middle line:84%
of really grumpy dispositions,
agitation, irritation.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously, that's
not working for them.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.593 align:middle line:84%
If you're having that, That's
not a normal manifestation.

00:20:56.593 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:84%
If you're having a balanced
diet, that wouldn't be, right?

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Low-carb diets
are a form of starvation.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And we burn fat because in the
old days, hunter-gatherers,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:90%
it was feast or famine.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And we were very
used to starving

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and probably were a
little on the grumpy

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
side during that
starvation time.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Probably.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.928 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So
that explains that.

00:21:12.928 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But what we really
have to try to take

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:84%
the stress, the emergency,
out of people's lives.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
People finish their day
exhausted and wasted.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Their life has
become a struggle.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
eating properly,

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
you finish your day with the
same energy as you started.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a sign post
of balanced diet.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.413 align:middle line:84%
If you need meal, snack,
meal, snack, meal,

00:21:34.413 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
snack, throughout the
day, I can guarantee you

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.920 align:middle line:84%
that your blood
sugar's unstable.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.485 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the first lifestyle
measures that you can take.

00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Can you go from breakfast to
lunch, from lunch to supper,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.027 align:middle line:84%
from supper to bed, with
no snacks and be satisfied?

00:21:46.027 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
If you can, blood
sugar's probably OK.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:84%
If you need that
snack, it's a red flag.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at
the same time, we're

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:84%
no longer accustomed
to becoming hungry.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.357 align:middle line:84%
We don't like the
feeling of hunger.

00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: That's right.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.732 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so as soon as
you feel your stomach growl

00:22:00.732 --> 00:22:04.620 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, just that first
pang of hunger, in the West--

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:90%
well, in America, anyway--

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
we tend to throw something
at it right away.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we've conditioned
ourselves to experience hunger

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:90%
as a negative.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.843 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.843 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: You bring
up a point there,

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:84%
because the sugars
in our foods provide

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
a certain sense of
satiety, not only

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
for the tummy and the
body, but for the brain.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And that instant surge
of sugar into the brain

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
activates a dopamine receptor,
dopamine in the brain.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And dopamine is the "I gotta
have it right now" hormone.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So the brain has been
triggered and used

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to from that first ice
cream as a 3-year-old

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
to "I gotta have it
right now" hormone.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:90%
So we have become--

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.860 align:middle line:84%
it's very interesting,
and I've written

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
about this in my
newsletters-- we've

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.510 align:middle line:84%
become little junkies,
little drug addicts,

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:84%
addicted to a host of dopamine
activators, like shopping.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
When you go shopping,
your dopamine level

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
starts to rise, and rise,
and then it goes higher.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you're browsing,
it's getting higher.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
swipe that card,

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.988 align:middle line:90%
the dopamine levels crash.

00:23:07.988 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
happens to people.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I see this with
women all the time.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:90%
They buy this stuff, and then--

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:84%
it's called shopping
bulimia, right?

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.825 align:middle line:90%
And then they get home.

00:23:16.825 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling down.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make them
happy after all.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Take the stuff back, right?

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Oh,
that's a good idea.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Or they go to Mrs.
Fields Cookies,

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
or they go to Cinnabon,
which is in the mall too.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And after they've swiped the
credit, they go, I'm hungry.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we're picking
on women here, but what

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.555 align:middle line:90%
about spectator sports and men?

00:23:33.555 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well,
men do the same thing.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Men are addicted to sitting
home, watching the football

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.882 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:23:37.882 --> 00:23:40.915 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Men are
addicted to work.

00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:42.540 align:middle line:84%
All of us can be
addicted to any of it.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But what I think
is a good strategy

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:84%
is to identify where
are your addictions?

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And sugar tends to
drive it for us.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
People see the
logo of Starbucks,

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and their dopamine
levels start to rise.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
You're a complete, insane drug
addict at that point in time.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.635 align:middle line:84%
You're driving in
there, and you're

00:24:00.635 --> 00:24:02.760 align:middle line:84%
ordering that Starbucks
whether you like it or not,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.010 align:middle line:84%
because your brain got
a look at that logo

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and made that connection,
and we're going.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.702 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
addicted we've become,

00:24:09.702 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and we have no idea
it's happening.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're really
stuck in a dopamine cycle.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: That's right.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in reality,
the feel-good chemical

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:90%
is serotonin.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Where does serotonin
come into this?

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It comes in at some
point when, as you say,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
you're eating your Cinnabon and
washing it down with a latte.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well, if you really
want to stretch it further,

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:84%
the real feel-good
chemical is oxytocin.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Which is the one
that you get when you give,

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and you care for, and you love,
and you take care of others.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:90%
So that's really the hormone.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the authentic one.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It's
the hugging hormone.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.662 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So when
you hug someone,

00:24:37.662 --> 00:24:40.237 align:middle line:84%
you actually produce more
oxytocin, and you give love.

00:24:40.237 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's the one thing--

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're really
looking for oxytocin

00:24:43.237 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
when we're splurging to feel
the serotonin spike, right?

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Looking for
love in all the wrong places.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.168 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I can get
something, it'll fill me up.

00:24:51.168 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that
that's not true.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:90%
But we rarely have the time.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm too busy to help, or
serve, or care, or actually

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.075 align:middle line:84%
love your husband, or your
wife, or your partner,

00:25:00.075 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to really give yourself
fully to that relationship.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.367 align:middle line:84%
Many of us don't do that
because we're just too busy

00:25:04.367 --> 00:25:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and lots of reasons
why, so we just

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.988 align:middle line:84%
live our separate,
parallel, coexisting lives,

00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and we never give ourselves
fully to that relationship.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And that commitment,
and the willingness

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:84%
to open the very delicate
petals of your flower

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and give yourself fully to
someone that you know you love,

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:84%
but because my mind
has convinced me to--

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're just
too spent all the time,

00:25:22.885 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and you just breeze
right past them.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But those are the things
we can do every day,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.845 align:middle line:84%
and it'll fill us up
on a deeper level.

00:25:27.845 --> 00:25:30.968 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, if you
have balanced meals and balanced

00:25:30.968 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
diet, you get off the
sugar roller coaster.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you're off
that sugar roller

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.460 align:middle line:84%
coaster, all of a
sudden, you're like, wow,

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't need anything.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't need that Starbucks.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't need that
injection to feel good.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling pretty
good just being myself

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.682 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole new
world for a lot of folks.

00:25:45.682 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you have to start
somewhere when you do that.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And a little later
in the program,

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
some of the things that's

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.390 align:middle line:90%
important to do.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
we'll get to also

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
is you understand Ayurveda.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to talk to you
about where does blood sugar

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:90%
play into this typology.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Absolutely.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I would love to
have you explain that in a bit.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, I want
to go back to a moment

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
ago when you were talking
about these chemicals.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So what is an appropriate
spectrum of dopamine,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:90%
serotonin, oxytocin?

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
What would a normal
lifestyle look like to you?

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I think people
are just sick of dieting.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
They're tired of things that
take time and take them out

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:84%
of community with other people
because they don't do gluten,

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.857 align:middle line:84%
they only eat raw, vegetarian,
which I did for 20 years.

00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It's
really quite simple.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Go back to basics.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Basics are three, good,
balanced meals per day.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:84%
If we were living off the farm,
we would eat different foods

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.023 align:middle line:90%
from season to season.

00:26:46.023 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
One of my books is called
"The 3-Season Diet,"

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:84%
is understanding that in
the winter, we harvest more

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:90%
proteins and fats.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:84%
In the spring,
more leafy greens.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.110 align:middle line:84%
In the summer, more
high-energy carbohydrates

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to get through the long days
and short nights of summer.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that every
season, the diet shifts.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So as we begin to start having
meals as opposed to snacks,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and we start to have
fat burning in between,

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and we start burning the calm
fuel and actually feel calm,

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:84%
we begin to naturally
crave what's in-season.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
We begin to reconnect
with those natural cycles.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you're going
downstream with the current,

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.857 align:middle line:84%
living in harmony with
nature, which is really

00:27:22.857 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
what Ayurveda is about, you feel
like life is not a struggle.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.477 align:middle line:90%
It's not such a strain.

00:27:27.477 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
You're not exhausted
at the end of your day.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.367 align:middle line:84%
So there's many strategies
to begin to re-entrain

00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:33.450 align:middle line:90%
with the cycles of nature.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.742 align:middle line:90%
Like the birds, they fly south.

00:27:34.742 --> 00:27:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Whales migrate.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Their survival depends on them
being in connection and harmony

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:90%
with those cycles.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:84%
We have just thrown
out the window.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.162 align:middle line:90%
We have no connection to that.

00:27:43.162 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We defy all cycles.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And it's
not that far away though.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Just a few little shifts
in your lifestyle,

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.192 align:middle line:90%
and you're right back in there.

00:27:49.192 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just a
few little shifts.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah,
little shifts.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.377 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take a
lot, but we need

00:27:53.377 --> 00:27:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to do something because the
program we're on right now

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:90%
is unsustainable.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
there seems to be--

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, this major
mental stumbling block

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.160 align:middle line:84%
to just going back to
harmony and balance.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Because even if you're
looking at it as someone who's

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.930 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to their health,
they're doing their yoga,

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.852 align:middle line:84%
they're running 6 miles a day
or whatever they're doing,

00:28:12.852 --> 00:28:14.310 align:middle line:84%
they're reading
through "delicious"

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and all the free food
supplement magazines

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.290 align:middle line:84%
that are in the grocery store,
even just looking at the ads

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:84%
there, any one of those things
will throw you out of balance,

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and become toxic
in and of itself.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:10%
So we have to really unplug
from the larger message,

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:10%
it sounds like, the
predominant message.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.103 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
talk about Ayurveda

00:28:31.103 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:10%
and going back into
balance when we come back.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:10%
So we'll just take a brief break
here, and we'll be right back.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.900 align:middle line:10%
We are back, and we're
going to talk qualitatively

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:10%
about some of the sugars that
we introduce into our lives,

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:10%
in our tea and other
drinks, before we

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:10%
get into the big, overarching
subjects of balance, harmony,

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:10%
Ayurveda, and some
other subjects.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:10%
So let's go back for a moment.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:10%
We talked about hidden sugars,
such as in dried fruits

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:10%
and such.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But people who are
listening and thinking,

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.500 align:middle line:84%
oh, I always have a shot
of vanilla in my latte--

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's pure sugar.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
agave, as you said--

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:84%
agave, honey, pure
white table sugar.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Coconut sugar--
that's one that's

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
come up recently as having
maybe a lower glycemic index.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:10%
>>DOUILLARD: All those sugars,
they all have a glycemic index,

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:10%
and they all hit your
bloodstream pretty quickly.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:30.990 align:middle line:10%
A Starbucks venti green iced
tea is 51 grams of sugar.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:37.390 align:middle line:84%
That's about almost 20
teaspoons of white table sugar.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
shocking, really.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So we were thinking
you're drinking a green tea,

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.910 align:middle line:90%
it's good for me.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So they're so hidden,
and they're so insidious.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But agave has a very
high glycemic index.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:90%
It's got a lot of fructose.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Fructose, while it doesn't
seem to impact your blood sugar

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:84%
glycemic index as well, which is
why we think it's good for you,

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.935 align:middle line:84%
it's very harsh on the liver,
and it's very difficult

00:29:59.935 --> 00:30:00.735 align:middle line:90%
to digest.

00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And what most
people don't realize is that

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:84%
the blood sugar is
regulated by three things--

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
the efficiency of
your intestinal villi,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:84%
your pancreas, we all
know, and your liver.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And your liver might be the
most important one of all.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we hit it
with lots and lots

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:27.300 align:middle line:84%
of sugars or lots of fructose,
then that overwhelms the liver.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Sugars are generally--
or fructose, for example,

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
most commonly harvested

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.300 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the summer.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.095 align:middle line:84%
The bears in the
fall are gorging

00:30:35.095 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:84%
on apples and all the fruits
because it converts straight

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.540 align:middle line:90%
into fat, so it insulates them.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why nature gave
it to us, just to really help

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:90%
to insulate and gain that fat.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly
what fructose does.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:90%
It helps the body store fat.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not processed
very easily by liver.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It converts right into
fat as an insulator.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Once a year, not a bad deal.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But in our culture, when
we're doing that plus--

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every day.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: --all the processed
sugars, and all the refined--

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:84%
when you go to a
health food store,

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and you get these
boxes of crackers,

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and it says "canola
oil" on it, that oil

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:84%
has been processed to the
hilt. It's non-digestible.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.590 align:middle line:84%
When you walk down the aisle
in the grocery store, and all

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.660 align:middle line:84%
those clear bottles
of oils that have

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:90%
been denatured and deodorized--

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Udo told me about that.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.025 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That stuff
is just undigestible.

00:31:25.025 --> 00:31:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it
layers into your liver.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And the sinusoid cells in your
liver become deeply congested.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And the bile moves all
through your liver,

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
trying to detoxify and
get rid of yucky stuff.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And if it gets congested,
it can't do that.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.755 align:middle line:84%
So it dumps the toxins
into your blood.

00:31:39.755 --> 00:31:42.005 align:middle line:84%
And your blood goes, OK, I
guess I'll get rid of these

00:31:42.005 --> 00:31:43.035 align:middle line:90%
fat-soluble chemicals--

00:31:43.035 --> 00:31:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're talking
about trans-fatty acids here.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Right,
that's exactly right.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.302 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And it pushes
it into your fat cells

00:31:48.302 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:84%
or even into your brain,
and that's an issue.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And trans fats
are another topic.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.660 align:middle line:84%
We think that they're all gone
because a couple years ago,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
they changed the label, and
now all labels say zero.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Isn't
that amazing to you?

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because as
long as those oils

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.167 align:middle line:84%
have been heated over a certain
temperature and processed,

00:32:03.167 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:90%
they all contain trans fats.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: As you just
said, if it's clear,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.410 align:middle line:10%
if it's not something that has
been delicately pressed out

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:10%
of the seed or nut and then
put into cold storage, intact,

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.860 align:middle line:10%
it likely has trans fats in it.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: What's
beautiful about trans fats--

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:84%
we all know that they're bad
for us because they're man-made

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.790 align:middle line:90%
fats--

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.140 align:middle line:84%
but trans fats are
very interesting.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
that trans fats have

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:31.120 align:middle line:84%
bonds that are on opposite sides
of this chain of fatty acids.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So it keeps it straight
like a toothpick, OK?

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The natural fats have
bonds on the same side,

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:90%
so it bends the fat.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.770 align:middle line:90%
So it keeps it bent.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So imagine taking a
bunch of toothpicks,

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.248 align:middle line:84%
and bending them in
all different shapes,

00:32:44.248 --> 00:32:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and then throwing
them into a jar.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Or taking a bunch of
toothpicks, and then

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.800 align:middle line:84%
throwing them into a
thing, and stacking them.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:84%
The trans fats stick together
because they're straight,

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and they're flat, and they
clump, and they congest deep

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:90%
in your liver.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And they compromise the
efficiency of your liver

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to metabolize fats,
raise cholesterol,

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and process blood sugar.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And the number one
reason for those morning blood

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:84%
sugars to rise, which is really
critical, those first morning

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.360 align:middle line:84%
blood sugars, is because
the liver is overshooting

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.615 align:middle line:84%
the runway first thing in
the morning with sugar.

00:33:14.615 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you're talking

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.210 align:middle line:84%
about the fat component
of that story,

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:90%
for years, butter was demonized.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And now butter has come
back, organic butters,

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.070 align:middle line:84%
mostly raw butters, for example,
as something the body at least

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:84%
recognizes versus
these processed canola

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
oils and other oils that
are sitting on the shelf.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And they can have a really
conscious label on it,

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean they
don't have trans fats

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.740 align:middle line:90%
and they haven't been processed.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you really look at this
whole issue of prediabetes,

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at sugars
blasting into your bloodstream

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:90%
and driving into your liver.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
fats layering, year

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.303 align:middle line:84%
after year, this little layer
of grease in your liver,

00:33:50.303 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:84%
congesting your
liver to the point

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:84%
where it becomes
basically non-functional.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So it really does boil
down to your liver.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.888 align:middle line:84%
And you gotta remember-- the
liver produces this bile,

00:33:58.888 --> 00:34:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and it shoots the bile
into your small intestine.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But before it gets to
the small intestine,

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:84%
it actually connects
with your pancreas ducts,

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.270 align:middle line:90%
which make your enzymes.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So if the liver has
become congested,

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and the bile's become thick and
viscous, which is very common,

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.060 align:middle line:84%
then the pancreatic
enzymes which digest

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:90%
won't get there either.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to take
digestive enzymes.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is we
just have congested

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:84%
liver, and congested bile
and pancreatic ducts,

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.870 align:middle line:90%
that are easy to decongest.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Fenugreek tea, cinnamon,
many foods you can eat--

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask you.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: --are very good
to clean out these-- beets

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.460 align:middle line:90%
are a phenomenal bile thinner.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Eat beets and beet creams
to clean out the liver,

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and get that liver and those
pancreatic ducts really moving.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It's phenomenal for
you to get that.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:84%
But we don't eat a
lot of those foods,

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.508 align:middle line:84%
so the liver just
gets more congested.

00:34:42.508 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then
the liver cleanse.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:84%
There's that famous
liver cleanse where you

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.759 align:middle line:90%
drink a cup of oil, basically.

00:34:47.759 --> 00:34:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about that a little bit?

00:34:50.548 --> 00:34:51.929 align:middle line:90%
Is that a fast way to do it?

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.860 align:middle line:84%
It's revolting, but is
it a quick path there?

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It's a really
powerful cleansing effect,

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and it can be risky
for some people.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of cleanses
on my website for people

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:90%
to get cleanses--

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I noticed that.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.188 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: --and really
about detoxifying the body,

00:35:10.188 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and making sure,
before you go and do

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:84%
a cleanse, that you've made sure
the body is a good detoxifier.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.468 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, you just pull
the yucky fat chemicals

00:35:17.468 --> 00:35:20.010 align:middle line:10%
out of the fat cells and move
them from one place to another.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:10%
It's really important
to reset digestion first

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:10%
and then detoxify.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:90%
That cleanse is very aggressive.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.225 align:middle line:84%
And I only do it
under supervision.

00:35:30.225 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I really just don't put it
out there for everybody to do.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:90%
I think it's risky.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But you can do something that
can actually flush and get

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:90%
the bile moving.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.430 align:middle line:84%
You can take 1 to 2
tablespoons of olive oil

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.860 align:middle line:84%
with 1 to 2 teaspoons of
lemon juice every night

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:84%
for about a month, and that's
like taking your gall bladder

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:90%
for a run.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It's like
exercising your gall--

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A nice, gentle way.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So it
forces it to contract,

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.922 align:middle line:84%
squirts out a bunch of bile,
cleans out those ducks.

00:35:51.922 --> 00:35:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can have a
lot of beets, like one

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.390 align:middle line:84%
or two beets during that
month, or one beet a day

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.497 align:middle line:84%
would be great, lots of
greens and leafy greens

00:35:58.497 --> 00:36:00.080 align:middle line:84%
during that month,
and you're starting

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to create a nice
program to decongest

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:90%
that liver for yourself.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's good to hear.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be so extreme.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah,
definitely not.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.578 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so speaking
of not being extreme,

00:36:08.578 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:84%
let's now start taking
this overarching subject

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:84%
of Ayurveda, and how the
body types are interfacing

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
with the subject of
blood sugar, and which

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.210 align:middle line:84%
ones might be more
livery, or kidney-ey,

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and might tend to become more
toxic in those given areas,

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.540 align:middle line:84%
so we recognize
ourselves in that story.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.392 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well, in Ayurveda,
there's three body types.

00:36:29.392 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Ayurveda's
the science of life.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It's how to live in harmony
with these natural cycles.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So in the winter,
there's a season

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:84%
that's cold and dry,
so there's people--

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
we all know them--
that are cold and dry,

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and they're hypermetabolic.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:43.580 align:middle line:90%
We call them Vata body types.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.112 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would that be more
Scandinavian, in general?

00:36:46.112 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well,
not necessarily.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.112 align:middle line:84%
Because, usually,
what's interesting,

00:36:49.112 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:84%
if you live in the
cold, your body

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:84%
will antidote that tendency,
and become hot and fiery.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet, you seem to see
a lot of tall, thin, almost

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.658 align:middle line:84%
brittle-looking people from
the extreme northern climates.

00:37:00.658 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah, it could be.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.463 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, you can get
any body type anywhere.

00:37:04.463 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: But the winter
body types, the Vata body types,

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:84%
are usually thinner-framed,
they're lighter build,

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:84%
they're quick-thinking,
fast, creative, artistic.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:90%
They think fast, forget fast.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything they
do is really fast.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And they're governed by air.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So the problem with
these Vata body types

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:84%
is they are doing everything
so fast that they skip meals,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and they don't eat
properly, they don't

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.260 align:middle line:90%
have a routine about them.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.047 align:middle line:84%
And they desperately
need a routine.

00:37:31.047 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And that creates the
tendency for them

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.270 align:middle line:84%
to have hypoglycemia because
they're constantly going up.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're very sensitive, so
they have a digestive system

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.270 align:middle line:90%
that's not built for endurance.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.247 align:middle line:90%
They need food when they get it.

00:37:43.247 --> 00:37:45.080 align:middle line:84%
When they don't get it,
they crash and burn.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.510 align:middle line:84%
They become very
vulnerable to that.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:51.680 align:middle line:84%
The Pitta body type, which is
the fiery, competitive, driven,

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.960 align:middle line:84%
change the world
kind of body type,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.740 align:middle line:84%
overheats, and is overly
competitive, and burns out.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:84%
That body type is the
one who is so involved

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.893 align:middle line:84%
in pushing through their
day that they forget to eat.

00:38:03.893 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
finally do eat,

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:06.812 align:middle line:90%
they either gorge themselves.

00:38:06.812 --> 00:38:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Or along the way,
they're nibbling,

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.910 align:middle line:84%
or eating candy or
Cokes, or just inhaling

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:12.348 align:middle line:90%
high glycemic index foods.

00:38:12.348 --> 00:38:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And that just shoots their
blood sugar right out.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'll do that
more so than the Vata will?

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.997 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: They will do that
more so than the Vata will.

00:38:18.997 --> 00:38:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the worst things that
we can do for our blood sugar--

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people do
this, and a lot of women

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:84%
do this, because you're so
busy, working, and taking

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.360 align:middle line:84%
care of the kids, and driving
here, and driving there,

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:90%
that they don't eat.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:84%
They cook the food
for everybody else,

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
eat it themselves,

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.307 align:middle line:84%
and they go through the day
without eating any food.

00:38:38.307 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the absolute
worst thing you

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:41.210 align:middle line:90%
can do for your blood sugar.

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens when your
blood sugar starts to crash,

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:46.190 align:middle line:84%
your adrenals go,
hey, this lady's nuts,

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:90%
store fat, craving some sugar.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And then they're nibbling
on jelly beans in their car,

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:84%
or they're just nibbling
on little things.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They eat at night
when everybody goes to bed.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So then all of that food
at night just sits there,

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's extremely hard
on the blood sugar.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So the Pitta body type,
the fiery body types, they

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:07.010 align:middle line:84%
can definitely become diabetic
because they run the risk

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:90%
of burning out and inflaming.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But it usually comes
from a lifestyle

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:90%
of pushing really, really hard.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have to realize, again,
eat meals, relax, take time.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
These are the types that
never stop and eat their food.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:84%
They inhale their
food, and they go.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And in Ayurveda, we always
talk about three things

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.510 align:middle line:90%
that are important for eating--

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.790 align:middle line:90%
how, when, and what you eat.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And the when we eat
is important-- meals

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.690 align:middle line:90%
versus snacks.

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.010 align:middle line:90%
The what we eat is important.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And America's all
about what to eat.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.910 align:middle line:84%
We have diets for every day
of the week for what to eat.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.237 align:middle line:84%
But reality is it's
more based on eating

00:39:40.237 --> 00:39:42.320 align:middle line:84%
what's in season, which
would be more appropriate.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But the most important one
of all is how you eat--

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.240 align:middle line:90%
relaxing and taking time.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, unless we have
a book, or a movie, or TV,

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.500 align:middle line:84%
or a phone to read, or a
magazine to flip through,

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.390 align:middle line:84%
we're not comfortable
eating our food.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So stopping, and relaxing,
and being settled

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:02.900 align:middle line:84%
allows you to digest
in an efficient manner.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Probably the biggest piece
of the blood sugar puzzle

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:90%
is stress.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And we live
in a stressed out world,

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're feeding
ourselves with comfort,

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.550 align:middle line:90%
stress-relieving foods.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:17.605 align:middle line:84%
And if we could just all go to
the beach, or go on vacation,

00:40:17.605 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and just chill, the blood
sugar changes dramatically.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you have your
Kapha body type, which

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:24.800 align:middle line:90%
is like the spring body type.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:84%
The Pitta types are the
fiery, summer types.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you have your
spring body types--

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Earth and water, heavy,
easygoing, mellow.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.420 align:middle line:90%
They're hypometabolic.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
a fast metabolism.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And in our culture,
with six meals a day,

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.290 align:middle line:84%
lots of high
glycemic foods, they

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:90%
don't have a fighting chance.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:46.240 align:middle line:84%
That hypometabolic body type,
that slow metabolic system,

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:84%
is going to store fat, and gain
weight, and predispose them

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.038 align:middle line:84%
to prediabetes and diabetes
for sure, as well as weight.

00:40:52.038 --> 00:40:53.455 align:middle line:84%
So they have to
move and exercise.

00:40:53.455 --> 00:40:55.855 align:middle line:84%
And we should probably talk
about the value of exercise

00:40:55.855 --> 00:40:56.710 align:middle line:90%
with blood sugar--

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we will.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: --because
that's important as well.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.052 align:middle line:84%
But these body types definitely
all can succumb to diabetes,

00:41:03.052 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we
have an epidemic.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.920 align:middle line:90%
It's everybody.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But we get there based on our
own individual predispositions.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And each of those
body types, from the thimbleful

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.630 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I really have about
Ayurveda, really

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:84%
requires a different
kind of fuel as well.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.150 align:middle line:84%
A hypometabolism versus
a hypermetabolism

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:84%
will be not only drawn to,
but require different types

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.812 align:middle line:90%
of food, won't they?

00:41:26.812 --> 00:41:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to
go through this.

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And aren't most of us
a combination of them?

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah, we are.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have a
dominant, but we'll

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.842 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit of one,
or maybe both of the others.

00:41:34.842 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: It's true.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
take a dominant Vata

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.300 align:middle line:90%
type of personality.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.240 align:middle line:84%
What would a day of
eating look like for them?

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The foods that would really
benefit their disposition,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.918 align:middle line:90%
their body type.

00:41:47.918 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: One of the
risks of a Vata body type

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is they are very sensitive,
and they have super high radar,

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.180 align:middle line:90%
so they feel everything.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to feel foods
that work or don't work.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And they have a very
sensitive system,

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.870 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have a real
robust digestive system.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So they're the
first ones to have

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:11.230 align:middle line:84%
issues with harder to digest
foods, like wheat and dairy,

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.790 align:middle line:90%
or animal products.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So they're the first
ones to get rid of wheat,

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.502 align:middle line:84%
and they get rid of
dairy, and they get rid

00:42:16.502 --> 00:42:17.470 align:middle line:90%
of animal products.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones to
shift towards being more ve--

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
more hypersensitive.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:21.895 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah, so
they become vegetarians.

00:42:21.895 --> 00:42:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And for
all good reasons.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.433 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to eat animals
and all these great reasons.

00:42:25.433 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that those
are dense proteins that

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:90%
stabilize blood sugar.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So if that Vata body
type became a vegetarian

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.703 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't digest
those hard to digest foods well

00:42:35.703 --> 00:42:37.870 align:middle line:84%
because they were very
sensitive in their digestion,

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:40.328 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't fix the reason,
and we just went to an easier

00:42:40.328 --> 00:42:43.960 align:middle line:84%
diet, they are the ones that
become lousy vegetarians.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And how you become
a lousy vegetarian?

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Without good protein
or enough protein,

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.017 align:middle line:90%
you start to crave sugar.

00:42:50.017 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:90%
You start to crave sweets.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you
know, you're just

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.250 align:middle line:84%
nibbling on carbs, or
sweets, or candies,

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.590 align:middle line:84%
or you have dark
chocolate stuffed away

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:59.838 align:middle line:84%
in your glove compartment
or in your closet.

00:42:59.838 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a little stash of
dark chocolate in your house,

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.275 align:middle line:84%
you've gotta think, is that
a blood sugar indicator?

00:43:05.275 --> 00:43:06.600 align:middle line:90%
It could very well be.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
lusting after Jack

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:90%
in the Box ads or something?

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If they're
protein-deprived,

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.130 align:middle line:84%
isn't that going to be
something that plays in?

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.200 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, it's
interesting, there

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.690 align:middle line:84%
are six tastes-- sweet,
sour, salt, pungent, bitter,

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:90%
and astringent.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And in America, we live
on sweet, sour, and salt.

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And sweet, sour, and
salt are comfort foods.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.610 align:middle line:90%
They calm us down.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:84%
McDonald's-- he must've went
to India many years ago,

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Ronald McDonald,
figured this out.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Addictive stuff.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I'm going to
give them salty French fries.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
them sweet milkshakes.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put pickles
on their burgers.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And that'll just
instantly calm them down.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're all stressed
out, going so fast,

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.910 align:middle line:84%
they're very aggravated,
Vata aggravated,

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.940 align:middle line:84%
so we give it to them
fast, they eat it fast,

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.380 align:middle line:90%
it instantly calms their Vata.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.410 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't digest well.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.210 align:middle line:90%
That's second.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.830 align:middle line:90%
We don't really talk about that.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And that creates heavy digestion
and bogs down the digestion,

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:59.620 align:middle line:84%
but it does provide a
satiety of feeling satisfied,

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and we crave that
in this country.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:90%
The other three tastes--

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:84%
bitter, and pungent, and
astringent-- the greens,

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and the spicy foods,
and those bitter roots

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that just aren't in
our diet anymore,

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.250 align:middle line:84%
those are the ones that
balance our blood sugar.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we need to eat.

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That, right there,
is probably the biggest piece.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So I'm a big fan,
when you look at your plate,

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that 2/3 of the plate
should be green,

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and 1/3 split between your
protein and your starch.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So when your mom fed you,
it was meat, and potatoes,

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and a vegetable,
or rice, and beans,

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and a vegetable, or chicken,
and rice, and a vegetable.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It was always balanced.

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:36.280 align:middle line:84%
They probably didn't give
us enough of the greens,

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and we didn't eat them anyway.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were canned.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.323 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: But the
ideas were right.

00:44:40.323 --> 00:44:41.440 align:middle line:90%
The balance was there.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And we've thrown
that out the window.

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, when you talk about
vegetables and the benefits

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.950 align:middle line:84%
of vegetables, what
the vegetables do,

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:84%
the green cellulose, the
fiber in the vegetables,

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:84%
is they attach to
the bile in your gut,

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and they escort
the bile, which is

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:84%
carrying toxins, and
chemicals, and cholesterol,

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.660 align:middle line:90%
into the toilet.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:04.180 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have enough greens
in your diet, 94% of that bile

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.643 align:middle line:84%
gets reabsorbed
back to your liver.

00:45:05.643 --> 00:45:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And your liver goes,
are you kidding me?

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I am so busy, I can't even be
thinking about redoing this.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put it into the
circulation to the blood,

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and now those cholesterols,
toxic chemicals,

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.890 align:middle line:84%
are circulating in your
blood, damaging and irritating

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:84%
your arteries, and
causing the predisposition

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:21.950 align:middle line:90%
to heart disease.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So the vegetables are
what escort the toxins

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.170 align:middle line:90%
into the toilet.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Not enough of those,
they go right back.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a
dangerous road or hull.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And so easy to do, really,
just by making sure you

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.280 align:middle line:90%
get those greens.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about people
who say, oh, I drink my green

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:37.380 align:middle line:90%
smoothie in the morning, right?

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.390 align:middle line:90%
My powdered greens.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:41.660 align:middle line:84%
How do powdered greens, micro
greens, and all that factor in?

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Is it still missing
the component we need,

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle line:90%
which is the fiber?

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right, exactly.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: We've extracted
all the micronutrients and maybe

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.710 align:middle line:84%
the sugars, which have
issues, and I'm OK

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.250 align:middle line:84%
having some of those juice
greens as part of a meal,

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:56.850 align:middle line:90%
but not a meal.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:58.490 align:middle line:90%
We should chew our food.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Here in Colorado,
kids are actually

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:84%
given chewing gum to
take standardized tests

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.020 align:middle line:84%
because the chewing
affects brain chemistry,

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.670 align:middle line:90%
and mental clarity, and focus.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Absolutely.

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Chewing-- you think about
if you were a gorilla,

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and you ate half your body
weight in vegetables per day,

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.600 align:middle line:84%
that's 100 pounds
of vegetables, it

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.490 align:middle line:84%
would take all day to chew
it, and that's what they do.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have the identical
digestion as they do.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Identical.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.420 align:middle line:84%
The only animal we can
actually swap them out.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And even the best raw food, if
we eat 2 pounds of vegetables

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.710 align:middle line:90%
per day, that's a huge amount.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not even eating
close to what they eat.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But those vegetables
require us to chew.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a whole shift
in our brain chemistry.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:44.070 align:middle line:84%
It prepares the
digestive system.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.880 align:middle line:84%
It provides the fiber to
escort the toxins out.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.840 align:middle line:90%
It's so critical.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind adding a
little juice or protein

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.360 align:middle line:84%
powders to the mix, but
that should not be a meal.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.632 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we should
not rely on greens.

00:46:55.632 --> 00:46:57.590 align:middle line:84%
As you said earlier,
salad's not a meal either.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Again, it goes back
to this balance.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:46:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.388 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
let's talk about Pitta.

00:47:01.388 --> 00:47:04.580 align:middle line:84%
What does an ideal spectrum
of food look like for Pitta

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.670 align:middle line:84%
compared to what we would
normally do as Pittas?

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well, the
Vatas will probably

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.157 align:middle line:84%
need smaller meals because
they have a smaller digestion.

00:47:11.157 --> 00:47:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And they still need
three meals a day.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I'll
actually let them

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:84%
have four meals to get
started, and then they

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.212 align:middle line:84%
can work their blood
sugar to have three.

00:47:17.212 --> 00:47:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the big
piece of the puzzle

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.837 align:middle line:84%
here is when you're going
from six meals a day

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to three meals a day, it
has to be without strain.

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Soon as you're
craving something,

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.680 align:middle line:90%
your blood sugar is crashing.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So eat a snack, make
it a healthy snack.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But then tomorrow,
have a bigger lunch,

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can make
the energy last a little

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:35.050 align:middle line:90%
bit longer.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, keep looking
to perfect that balance.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.035 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Work it.

00:47:37.035 --> 00:47:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Pitta types, they
have a big furnace,

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and they need a lot of fuel.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.807 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
need higher quantities.

00:47:42.807 --> 00:47:44.390 align:middle line:84%
You want to make
sure that they're not

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:46.340 align:middle line:84%
eating a lot of spicy
food because that can

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.880 align:middle line:90%
overheat them and inflame them.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.758 align:middle line:84%
And diabetes, or prediabetes,
is actually inflammation

00:47:50.758 --> 00:47:52.550 align:middle line:84%
of either the gut, the
liver, the pancreas,

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.770 align:middle line:84%
one of those three, or
all three get inflamed.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And Pitta types, they
tend towards inflammation.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they have to make
sure they're eating good.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
cooling foods are

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.060 align:middle line:84%
going to be the greens
and the bitters.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.728 align:middle line:90%
The pungent foods, or--

00:48:06.728 --> 00:48:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry-- the bitter foods,
and the astringent foods,

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.870 align:middle line:84%
the greens, and the
vegetables, and the beans,

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:13.760 align:middle line:90%
are very cooling for the body.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Pitta types
who need big doses of sugar

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:22.250 align:middle line:84%
into the brain right away,
they crave potatoes, and meats,

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and burgers, and fries, and
that quick, high-carb injection

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:84%
to the brain, which,
of course, gives them

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.510 align:middle line:90%
the energy they need.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But it actually brews the
underlying inflammation

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.505 align:middle line:90%
which we don't want to have.

00:48:34.505 --> 00:48:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, Kapha.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Kapha types
are easygoing, mellow, slow

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.410 align:middle line:90%
metabolic body types.

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:43.280 align:middle line:84%
They really require
three tastes--

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.490 align:middle line:90%
pungent, bitter, and astringent.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So they live in
a world, America,

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that is a sweet,
sour, and salty world,

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and they require pungent,
bitter, and astringent.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So they require
spicy food to burn up

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the fat, astringent foods to
clean and detoxify, and bitter

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.530 align:middle line:84%
foods to flush the
system with more

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.478 align:middle line:84%
alkaline, lymphatic,
moving agents.

00:49:02.478 --> 00:49:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a world where
it's exactly the opposite.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.535 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people
I know who are Kapha

00:49:06.535 --> 00:49:09.070 align:middle line:90%
constitutions like ice cream--

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Pizza.

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Popcorn and pizza.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So these are issues
we have to be careful.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.467 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so basically,
they're eating exactly

00:49:16.467 --> 00:49:17.400 align:middle line:90%
out of their type.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:20.210 align:middle line:90%
And so what about breakfast?

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody's thinking
in terms of rice,

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and protein, and
greens for breakfast.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you have?

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.290 align:middle line:84%
What would you
recommend for breakfast?

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well,
breakfast can vary.

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:30.558 align:middle line:90%
It can be eggs, which are good.

00:49:30.558 --> 00:49:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
good for all types?

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It can
be good for all types.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:33.732 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:33.732 --> 00:49:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I think that
based on the seasons,

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:37.070 align:middle line:84%
you can make some adjustment,
but eggs are good.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.880 align:middle line:84%
A good piece of good,
sprouted-grain bread

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.680 align:middle line:90%
can be good.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel bread, something
like that's good.

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:42.320 align:middle line:90%
That's for starch.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And now you need
your vegetables.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you can get
the kale, or the greens,

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.020 align:middle line:84%
or the leafy baby greens
already pre-washed.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Just pull it out,
and you can have

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.320 align:middle line:84%
that with a cup of herbal
tea with your breakfast,

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.130 align:middle line:90%
and it's great.

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.000 align:middle line:90%
You've got your greens.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, you acquire

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.062 align:middle line:90%
a taste for these things.

00:49:58.062 --> 00:50:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Because inside that
green stuff is sugar.

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:01.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what's in there.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you chew it, you
actually acquire a taste.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.840 align:middle line:84%
You change your brain
chemistry to actually

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.360 align:middle line:84%
be satisfied with something
green versus something

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.502 align:middle line:84%
super sweet, like the
sugar in your coffee.

00:50:10.502 --> 00:50:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
just have to change

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.100 align:middle line:90%
this paradigm of thinking.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Vegetables are cool
in the morning.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:14.630 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: They are.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.420 align:middle line:90%
They can be.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole
thing, the leaves--

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Absolutely.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.087 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Especially leaves.

00:50:18.087 --> 00:50:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Or like
celery and a nut butter.

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That's
green, and that's

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.440 align:middle line:90%
another way of doing breakfast.

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I love
that in the morning.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: That's great.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almond butter
and celery, love it.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.183 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yep, perfect.

00:50:25.183 --> 00:50:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
what about exercise?

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.210 align:middle line:90%
And let's do this for--

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.003 align:middle line:84%
however you choose
to break it-- well,

00:50:31.003 --> 00:50:32.420 align:middle line:84%
we only have about
5 minutes left,

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.910 align:middle line:84%
so we want to talk about
exercise and then blood

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:35.750 align:middle line:90%
monitoring.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So encapsulate exercise
for us, because I

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.070 align:middle line:84%
know different
constitutions need

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.450 align:middle line:90%
a different kind of exercise.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:43.533 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Everybody
needs a different exercise.

00:50:43.533 --> 00:50:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Vata types are hypermetabolic.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So that means fast moving,
thinking all the time,

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:50.270 align:middle line:84%
90 miles an hour in their
brain, they need to slow down.

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yoga?

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: So yoga.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And hiking
is great for them.

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.352 align:middle line:84%
Pitta types are fiery, and
aggressive, and competitive,

00:50:55.352 --> 00:50:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and driven, and they tend to
be very, very competitive,

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:84%
so they need exercises
that are relaxing.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.423 align:middle line:84%
Yoga is good, but they also
need aerobic activity as well.

00:51:03.423 --> 00:51:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But something that's beautiful,
like skiing, where they're

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.295 align:middle line:90%
actually in beautiful places.

00:51:07.295 --> 00:51:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dancing.

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Dancing.

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Things that
you like doing anyway.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That
you love doing.

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Things that they love to do.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about hiking?

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Not
for winning, yes.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Not just to win.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not just running.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Not another
competitive venture, right?

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And then Kapha
types, just give anything.

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Move.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Anything, yes.

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Anything will take--
bike riding, running,

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:26.590 align:middle line:84%
but they need to move
their body for sure.

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Now blood sugar,
when the sugar goes

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:34.610 align:middle line:84%
high in your blood,
the first system that

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:38.730 align:middle line:84%
shut down the ability to suck it
up, the sugar, is your muscles.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So the muscles, they cause
the insulin resistance.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So we can use exercise to
actually reinstate sugar back

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.630 align:middle line:84%
into those muscles,
and use your muscles

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to be the big gas
guzzlers for that sugar

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and take the stress off
the rest of your system.

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:52.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge opportunity.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't do it.

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Now if I asked you,
when was the last time

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.160 align:middle line:90%
you ran as fast as you could?

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.588 align:middle line:90%
What would you say?

00:51:59.588 --> 00:52:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A couple
days ago, but that

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:04.260 align:middle line:84%
was only because I had
to run because I was late

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.060 align:middle line:90%
for something.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: OK, good.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But normally,
I don't run full speed.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I might jog a little,
but mostly walk.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Now if
you ask a 12-year-old,

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.750 align:middle line:84%
hey, when was the
last time you ran?

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every day.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:12.460 align:middle line:90%
I used to run every day.

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:12.880 align:middle line:90%
I loved running.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So kids use their
fast-twitch muscle fibers

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.480 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.082 align:middle line:84%
As we become adults, we
do yoga, we go hiking,

00:52:20.082 --> 00:52:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and we don't use our body
using the fast-twitch part.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're afraid
we're going to strain something,

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.310 align:middle line:84%
hurt ourselves, pull
a muscle, hamstring--

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: But there's
ways you can do it.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.027 align:middle line:84%
You can take two tuna
fish cans, and you

00:52:29.027 --> 00:52:30.320 align:middle line:90%
can go like this really fast.

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: You can punch.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.740 align:middle line:84%
You can just step up and down
your stairs in your house

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.760 align:middle line:90%
as fast as you could.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you use
fast-twitch fibers,

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.837 align:middle line:84%
it takes all the sugar
out of your blood.

00:52:38.837 --> 00:52:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD:
Slow-twitch fibers--

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Intervals.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.490 align:middle line:84%
That's where Mercola and
this whole interval thing

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.480 align:middle line:90%
is really handy.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So fast-twitch activation
pulls the sugar.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Slow, long duration
activities burn fat fast,

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.220 align:middle line:90%
which burns sugar.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So you want to get that
sugar out of your blood.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And I have a workout on my
website called the "12 Minute

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Workout."

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.450 align:middle line:90%
It's 12 minutes.

00:52:58.450 --> 00:52:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 12 minutes?

00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: You leave the room.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:00.750 align:middle line:90%
You come back.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.950 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Nobody even knows
you're finished.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm going to tell
them how to get to your site.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.240 align:middle line:90%
So we know we have to move.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:05.535 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:05.535 --> 00:53:06.335 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yes.

00:53:06.335 --> 00:53:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what about
monitoring our blood sugar?

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:84%
We only have a minute
or two left now.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I think
one of the best ways--

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.600 align:middle line:84%
if you're not sure whether you
have high blood sugar or not,

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and you have cravings
for sugar, you

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:19.790 align:middle line:84%
know you have a little issue
there, go get a blood sugar

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:20.915 align:middle line:90%
monitor at a pharmacy.

00:53:20.915 --> 00:53:22.040 align:middle line:90%
We sell them on my website.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:90%
They're really good ones, cheap.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.410 align:middle line:90%
But you can get it anywhere.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And you test your blood
sugar in the morning.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little prick on
your finger in the morning.

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Little
prick on your fingers,

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.598 align:middle line:84%
squeeze some blood out, and
you check in the morning.

00:53:29.598 --> 00:53:31.640 align:middle line:84%
If that number is
over 100, you're

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.290 align:middle line:84%
knocking on the
door of prediabetes.

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:36.080 align:middle line:84%
If that number is
between below 85,

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.800 align:middle line:84%
you're actually healing
your arterial walls.

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.490 align:middle line:84%
If that number is
over 85, you're

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:42.050 align:middle line:84%
beginning to damage
your arteries.

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:44.810 align:middle line:84%
If it's over 100, then
you have prediabetes,

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:46.320 align:middle line:84%
we need to take
this more seriously.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So if your numbers
are between 70 and 85,

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:50.160 align:middle line:90%
have a little dessert.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy life.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But make it healthy,
eat balanced meals.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry too much about this.

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.153 align:middle line:84%
But if those numbers
are over 100 or 110,

00:53:58.153 --> 00:54:00.320 align:middle line:84%
we got to be on the straight
and narrow for a while.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.028 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is
it's all reversible.

00:54:02.028 --> 00:54:03.737 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:54:03.737 --> 00:54:05.437 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Prediabetes
is reversible,

00:54:05.437 --> 00:54:07.520 align:middle line:84%
but we need to take
responsibility for our health.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the best
ways is to look at that number

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:09.740 align:middle line:90%
every morning.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And you get super psyched.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.650 align:middle line:84%
When that number's a
little high in the morning,

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.610 align:middle line:84%
you're like, OK, dang it,
no sugar for me today.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can do
something about that.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't know,
you're, eh, whatever.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a little
of this sweet here.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.192 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in almost every
case, it is reversible.

00:54:21.192 --> 00:54:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Out of all of this,
that's the take-away.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That's
the best news ever.

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If we
take responsibility,

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:26.600 align:middle line:84%
we can reverse
all of the damage.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.058 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That
and nut butter is

00:54:28.058 --> 00:54:30.200 align:middle line:84%
good are the two
best reports all day.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right, very good.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.550 align:middle line:84%
I hope this has been as
beneficial and educational

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:36.110 align:middle line:90%
to you as it has been to me.
