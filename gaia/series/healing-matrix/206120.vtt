00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD GROUP: Thanks for
being here, Dr. Blanche.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BLANCHE GRUBE: Thank you.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, very
much, for having me.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So explain to
us, what is a cavitation?

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUBE: Well, simply
put, a cavitation

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:10%
as a hole in the bone
that never healed.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
That should have
healed, but never did.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And inside that hole
are all of the bacteria

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and the bacterial toxins that
we had discussed previously

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking
about root canals.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:10%
So it's, pretty much,
the same scenario.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:10%
You have bacteria that are
multiplying, multiplying,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:10%
producing toxins.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But in the cavitation,
just like the root canal,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:90%
there's no circulation.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
There's no white blood
cells able to get in there

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:90%
and get these bacteria.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the cesspool continues
to grow and grow and grow.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:10%
Until finally, the toxins
from these bacteria

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.222 align:middle line:10%
seep out and affect the body.

00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Which is why the patient, when
they have their wisdom teeth

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
extracted or they have
any other tooth extracted,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, when they
have the tooth extracted

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:90%
they don't get sick right away.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It takes years and years
and years for those toxins

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.277 align:middle line:84%
to build up and to seep
out of that cavitation.

00:01:35.277 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, we have some
images of some cavitations.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.443 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can walk us
through some of these.

00:01:39.443 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Sure.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So the picture on the
right is a molar that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:90%
has a very large cavity in it.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:10%
You can see how wide the
main canal of this tooth.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:10%
So this is a dead tooth.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:10%
That's for sure.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
a tooth missing.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:10%
And then in front
of that is what we

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.245 align:middle line:10%
call a bicuspid or a premolar.

00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
If you happen to
look at the bone

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that normal
healthy bone is white in color.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:10%
It has something called
trabeculation patterns.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the bone
itself has a pattern.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
A kind of a lacy pattern
that flows through the bone.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look at
this picture, though,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
we can actually see
and trace the shape

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
of the roots of the tooth
that was there before.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And my guess is this tooth was
probably taken out perhaps,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:90%
10, 15, 20 years.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:10%
But you can still
see the empty space

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:10%
where the roots used to be.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, where are they?

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:90%
They're not there anymore.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But then why didn't
it fill in with bone?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It didn't fill in with bone
because the outside bone that

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
held that tooth just outside
of the periodontal ligament

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
space, the outside of
that bone was dead bone.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And because it was dead
bone it formed a wall

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:90%
around that space.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I know in all the
years of study that I've done,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:84%
dead bone does not
multiply and make new bone.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Got it.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another image
here and see what we can see.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Ah.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
This slide actually brings tears
to my eyes every time I see it.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
jaw of a pathologist.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
A pathologist who had severe
head pain for many, many years

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and nobody was able to
diagnose his head pain.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And before he died, he
asked Dr. Jerry Bouquot

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
who's one of the world's
leading bone pathologists,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.481 align:middle line:84%
he asked Dr. Bouquot
if he would--

00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:84%
this is gross, I mean-- take
his head and do a biopsy on it.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:90%
And Dr. Bouquot did that.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Sliced his jaw.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And what he saw was this
black, oily, mushy substance

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
in a place where there should
be normal healthy bone.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, in many of
these cavitations when

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
we enter in through
the cortical bone--

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
the top bone-- we enter
into it this black oil

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
comes floating up to the top.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And that oil is there
because the bacteria

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
have grown so much that
they begin to digest and eat

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
the myelin sheath that
covers that major nerve

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:90%
bundle inside the jawbone.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:84%
That myelin sheath is
made up of cholesterol.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:90%
It's fat.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It's black because
there's fungus involved.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:10%
There's microorganisms that
have a black color to them

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:10%
and so that's why it's black.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.365 align:middle line:84%
But the oil is actually coming
from the myelin sheath that's

00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:90%
underneath the nerve.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And by the time a
cavitation gets so big

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to attack
that inferior alveolar nerve

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and nerve bundle and muscles
and everything that's

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
underneath there,
by time it starts

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to attack that the
patient has severe pain.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:10%
And that's not true
of all cavitations.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Most patients have
cavitations and don't even

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:90%
know they have them.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.545 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I was going
to say, how do you even

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:90%
know if you have a cavitation?

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: You have to
have an X-ray taken.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And not just a two
dimensional X-ray.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Although, for many
years, that's all

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:90%
we had and that's what we used.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And we used it probably
fairly proficiently.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Now in dentistry, we have
something called a 3D cone beam

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:90%
X-ray.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:10%
Where an X-ray is taken.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:10%
The beam literally travels
around the whole head

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:10%
and takes a 3D image and
it's computer-generated.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:10%
So once the X-ray is taken
it's put on my computer.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I can slice this X-ray in
every direction that I want to.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually see
the cavitation hole

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:90%
in three dimensions.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Wow.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So some people have
symptoms, you say,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and some people
don't have symptoms.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Correct.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.578 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a small number.

00:05:55.578 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: But regardless, if you
have a cavitation, most likely,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
you have something negative
happening inside of it.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That is correct.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And you won't know what problems
you have from the cavitation

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.065 align:middle line:84%
until the cavitation
is cleaned out.

00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Is there anything
that can cause the cavitation

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.643 align:middle line:90%
to become more problematic?

00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I think it's just
like any infection in the body.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The better you take
care of yourself,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
the better you're able
to control the infection.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't want-- once those
toxins start getting released,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
if you're healthy, your
body can handle it.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you allow your body
to deteriorate because you're

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:84%
consuming too much sugar,
too much processed food,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.600 align:middle line:84%
too much alcohol,
too many cigarettes,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going to
be able to handle this.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And a weakened immune
system is going

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
to allow a cavitation
to get bigger

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and to produce more toxins and
get released into the body.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So besides pain,
what other health conditions

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:90%
can cavitations cause?

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Oh.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Just about everything.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
It really all depends on what
the person's weak genetic link

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.720 align:middle line:84%
If you have a tendency
in your family line

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to develop arthritis,
then more likely than not

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:84%
as these toxins release
into the bloodstream,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:84%
they're going to enter
into your joints.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
develop arthritis perhaps,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
sooner than your
grandparents did

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.930 align:middle line:90%
or your great-grandparents did.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
If your genetic weak link
is to have heart problems,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
well, then that's where
the toxins are going to go.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on what
your weak genetic link is.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's different for everybody.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Again, that makes
it so difficult

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
to make the connection between
the symptoms and the fact

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that you had four wisdom teeth
removed at the age of 17.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Does it have
anything to do with time?

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's say you
have a cavitation.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Is there a certain
time period that people

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
have to wait before
they might be feeling

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:90%
any type of negative symptoms?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Like a week, six
months, three years?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:84%
You're saying
everybody's different.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:90%
I believe in that.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has
different genetics.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed any type
of time frame associated

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:90%
with problematic cavitation?

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yes.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The majority of my
patients come to see me

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:90%
between the ages of 40 and 60.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.608 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually, 90% of them
are the wisdom teeth sites.

00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And they had their
wisdom teeth taken

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
out between the ages of 17
and, say, perhaps 23 years old.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:90%
So you have to give time.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to give time
so that the bacteria can

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
multiply, produce toxins,
start entering into the body.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:90%
And then the body says, OK.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:90%
We have a problem here.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the body
always senses-- as soon

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
as it senses there's a problem
the body sends white blood

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:84%
cells to that area to
fight the infection.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
But then, again,
there's no circulation

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:90%
inside a cavitation.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So the white blood
cells can go just so far

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and they stop at the door.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And most white blood cells
live approximately seven days.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Some eight days,
some six and a half.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Seven days on average.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.475 align:middle line:84%
So after seven days,
those white blood cells

00:08:57.475 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:84%
that have been sitting
outside the door

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
of the cavitation waiting
to get inside they're dying

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.770 align:middle line:90%
and they're dead.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:90%
And so what happens?

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
The body then sends
another 100,000 white blood

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:90%
cells to the same area.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:90%
They sit and they wait.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And after seven
days they die, also.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And so this happens year after
year after year after year.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And so, you've got
an immune system

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
that's working on a problem
that it can never take care of.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:90%
It can never resolve it.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So you happen to step
into an elevator.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Somebody comes in behind you.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:90%
[SNEEZE] And they sneeze.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And that person had hepatitis C.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So now hepatitis C enters
into your nostrils.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Enters into the right bronchi.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And I like to give my patients
a little cartoon figure to,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.845 align:middle line:84%
kind of, imagine
what's going on.

00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So now we've got
some white blood

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:84%
cells in the right bronchi And
they noticed this hepatitis C

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:90%
virus.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:84%
They pick up the phone right
away, and they, "Red alert.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Red alert.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Call the president
of spleen university.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.747 align:middle line:10%
We've got hepatitis
C, right bronchi."

00:10:04.747 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the president
of spleen university

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:90%
gets very concerned.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.953 align:middle line:84%
And he's told by the brain,
who's really in charge--

00:10:11.953 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
he's told by the
brain, I want you

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to send a million white blood
cells to the right bronchi

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:90%
on the double, ASAP.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And the president of spleen
university is, oh, boy,

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:90%
frustrated.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute, we've been
sending 100,000 white blood

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
cells every seven days to
the four wisdom teeth sites

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:90%
for 20 years now.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:10%
I don't have a
million white blood

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:10%
cells to send to right bronchi.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Or suppose it's a cancer cell
in the uterus, or in the ovary,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:90%
or in the breast.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't have that many
white blood cells.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what
I'll do, though.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll send just a couple of
hundred white blood cells.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'll send you some
immature white blood cells.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And let's see if that
takes care of the problem.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:90%
So this is what happens.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
When you have a root canal,
or you have a cavitation,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and you've had it
for years and years,

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
it has already depressed
your immune system.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Even though your
white blood cell count

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:84%
may appear to be normal, you
may have a white blood cell

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.068 align:middle line:90%
count that's a perfect 5.5.

00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at the
mean corpuscular volume,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:84%
you see it's elevated, which
means that you're putting out

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.807 align:middle line:90%
immature cells.

00:11:25.807 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So what good is having
a perfect white blood

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:84%
count if you're having immature
cells that can't do the job?

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:84%
They can't take
care of the problem.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And so now we wind
up with disease.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
We wind up with a
serious problem.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it caused directly by the
cavitation or root canal?

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:90%
I guess you could say no.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:90%
It's caused indirectly.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a problem that
the body has to take care of.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And then it can't take care of
the more serious problem that

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:90%
comes down the pike.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm a believer
in the American way.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
it's a free country.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:84%
You can do whatever you want
with your white blood cells.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
You can spend your
white blood cells

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
taking care of a root canal
tooth or a cavitation.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I'd rather
save my white blood cells

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and use them for
something serious,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
like cancer, like
hepatitis C. OK?

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Like coronavirus,
something like that.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I would rather save
my white blood cells.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But if a person wants to keep
a root canal and a cavitation,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:90%
fine, go right ahead.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Just know that you're using
up your white blood cells.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And our white blood cell
system, it's a finite system.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
The day you were born, there was
a number that was given to you.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
You were going to have
just so many replications

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:84%
of your white blood cells,
the day you were born.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Just like when a
woman is born, she's

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:90%
born with just so many eggs.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.363 align:middle line:90%
It's a finite system.

00:12:50.363 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:90%
She reaches a certain point.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:90%
She's not ovulating anymore.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Game's over.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:84%
With us, we have so
many replications

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%
of white blood cells.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, we may be able
to pass that number

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and produce more and
more white blood cells.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:90%
But they're immature cells.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
They're not capable
of doing the job.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Is there
a specific method

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
that you use to
diagnose cavitations?

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I use primarily
3D cone beam X-ray.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I know I have many friends
in the biological dentistry

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and medicine field
that use EAV testing.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:90%
They use muscle testing.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
different ways.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think the rule of thumb
should be a 3D cone beam X-ray

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.970 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see exactly what's
going on, of course, prior to--

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How many dentists
actually have those?

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.287 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Not too many.

00:13:38.287 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:90%
They're very expensive machines.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I got mine on sale.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:10%
It only cost me $169,000.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:10%
They're very expensive machines.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's not impossible
to diagnose a cavitation

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:90%
on a panoramic X-ray.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
That's that flat one
that shows the whole jaw.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's also a two
dimensional picture.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not impossible.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You can see them on
that kind of an X-ray,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
or the little small 18 pictures
that we call a full mouth

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:90%
series.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:90%
You can see it in those also.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But the Cadillac now is the
3D cone beam, because you

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.343 align:middle line:90%
can see it in three dimensions.

00:14:12.343 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you
see a cavitation.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.010 align:middle line:90%
What's the next stage?

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:90%
What's the solution?

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: The solution is to
go in without epinephrine

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and surgically clean it out,
remove all of that dead bone.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Remove the black oil that I
told you we sometimes see.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What you would
call cavitation surgery?

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: That is called
cavitation surgery.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know it sounds
horrible to our listeners.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, my God, you're
going to drill into my bone.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It's actually less
traumatic, much

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
less traumatic than
having a tooth taken out.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.730 align:middle line:90%
A small incision is made.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:90%
We peel the gums back.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:90%
We enter through the bone.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And we Roto-Rooter and
clean out all of the gunk.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we've seen pus.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:90%
We've seen yellow.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%
We've seen green.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
We've seen black, every color
under the rainbow we've seen

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:90%
come out of these cavitations.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Clean the mouth thoroughly.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Remove all of the dead bone
that's around the outside.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And then a miracle happens.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
The patient's own
blood fills the hole.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And their own blood turns
into their own bone.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, you
mentioned epinephrine.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain to
everybody what that is.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And you said not
to use epinephrine.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Correct.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm of the belief that
most of these cavitations

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
occur because dentists
use epinephrine

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:90%
when they take out the teeth.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:90%
So what is epinephrine?

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Epinephrine is a chemical
that is actually produced

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.060 align:middle line:90%
by our own adrenal glands.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
It's that fight
or flight chemical

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that allows a mother to
pick up a car because she

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:90%
sees her son underneath it.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the body
produces this chemical that

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:90%
gives you superhuman strength.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
It causes your
heart to beat fast.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It causes your blood
vessels to contract.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
It causes your eyes
to dilate, everything

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that you would possibly need
should you have a tiger chasing

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:90%
after you, correct?

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So those are your flight
or flight reactions.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's produced
by our adrenal glands.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But epinephrine is also
synthetically made.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It's made in a
chemical laboratory.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's placed inside
the little glass bottle

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
that the dentist
uses when they're

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:90%
going to give you Novocaine.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we use the term
Novocaine loosely today

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
because there's probably
6, 7, 10 different brands.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.745 align:middle line:90%
There's Zilocaine.

00:16:26.745 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:90%
There's Carbocaine.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:90%
There's Mepivacaine.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
There's Bupivacaine, all these
different caines out there.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, they put epinephrine
in most of them.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.348 align:middle line:90%
So why do they do that?

00:16:36.348 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the
dentist wants to be

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
able to give you an injection
and have you stay numb.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
continually have

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
to stop and give you injection,
stop and give you injection.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's the primary
reason they give you

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Novocaine with epinephrine.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
The second reason is because
epinephrine causes the blood

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:90%
vessels to contract.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the blood
vessels contract,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:90%
you have a lot less bleeding.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
That's also something
that the surgeon likes.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:84%
Not Dr. Huggins and
Dr. Blanche Grube.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
We actually like
bleeding, because when

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:84%
you bleed you wash out
all of the bacteria that

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:90%
may be hiding in the bone.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you mentioned
that the blood fills up,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:90%
and that creates new bone.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: New bone.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:90%
So we want you to bleed.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: But what
you're saying is,

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:84%
if you do the epinephrine,
the blood vessels contract.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get
the blood filling up.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Cause I was going to ask
you, well, initially when

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
you had your wisdom teeth
pulled out they most likely

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:90%
used epinephrine.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Absolutely.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And so it didn't
fill in the right way.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Correct.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, the
smallest of the blood vessels

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:90%
closed completely.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
the capillaries.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:90%
They're real teeny.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of those
capillaries, they're

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
so small that the red blood
cell has to squish itself

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:90%
to get into that capillary.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:84%
What's absolutely amazing
about the human body

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
is that every cell in the
body has a capillary that

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:84%
goes to it to give it oxygen.
And it has another capillary

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:84%
on this side to take away
the CO2 and what other toxins

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:90%
it has to remove.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So every cell in the body has
a capillary that goes to it.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you give a
drug called epinephrine

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that causes the capillaries
to close, like this.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, then that poor, little
cell, which in this case

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.760 align:middle line:84%
is an osteocyte,
it's a bone cell,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that poor, little cell is
not getting any oxygen.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So I once asked Dr. Jerry
Bouquot, world's leading bone

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.825 align:middle line:90%
pathologist.

00:18:32.825 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I went up to him
after a lecture.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Dr. Bouquot,
how long can a bone cell

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.150 align:middle line:90%
go without oxygen?

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I expected him to say
six or seven minutes.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.873 align:middle line:84%
I can hold my breath
for two minutes.

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
That's truly what I
expected him to say.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
he said, about 34 seconds.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
After 34 seconds if that cell
doesn't get oxygen, it dies.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a dentist
who gives epinephrine.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.530 align:middle line:84%
All of these bone
cells are waiting

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
for oxygen. They're not getting
it because the capillaries are

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.280 align:middle line:90%
closed.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:90%
These bone cells die.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe
that is the cause

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:90%
of all of these cavitations.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
95% of the people
walking around that

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
have had four wisdom teeth
taken out have four cavitations.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:84%
They didn't all get
punched in the face.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
They didn't all do a
round with Muhammad Ali.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get hit
with a baseball, no.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:84%
The one thing they
all had in common

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:84%
was they all had their teeth
taken out with Novocaine

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:90%
with epinephrine.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So I really do believe
that that's the cause.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you would
recommend, again,

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
anybody who has cavitations,
get the proper type of surgery

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.760 align:middle line:90%
without epinephrine.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Without epinephrine.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:10%
And if some of our listeners
are being scheduled now

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:10%
to have their wisdom
teeth taken out,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:10%
to have any other kind of
tooth taken out, please,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:10%
my advice to you is beg the
doctor to not give epinephrine.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:90%
They can give you a novocaine.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.210 align:middle line:90%
It's called Carbocaine.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
called Citanest Plain.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Write those down,
Carbocaine, Citanest Plain.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
They can give these
without epinephrine.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Take the tooth out.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And even if they don't
remove all of the ligament,

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
you've got excellent
circulation.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.650 align:middle line:84%
The socket is
bleeding like crazy.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:90%
This is a good thing.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:90%
We want this to happen.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
The body will take care
of whatever ligament

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:84%
is left behind because there's
plenty of oxygen and blood

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:90%
flow.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And then that
great blood flow is

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:90%
going to turn into normal bone.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.678 align:middle line:90%
And it will heal.

00:20:40.678 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How many
dentists out there

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:84%
actually know not to use
epinephrine when they're

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:90%
doing cavitation surgery?

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: I would take a guess.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's 1,000 in
the whole United States.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: But the biological
dentists will know.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: The
biological dentists all

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.318 align:middle line:90%
know not to use epinephrine.

00:20:58.318 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Let's talk
about another practice

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that's very common in
dentistry these days, implants.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is an implant?

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: A piece of metal
that's screwed into the jaw.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: When and
why are they used?

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.377 align:middle line:84%
Why are so many people
getting implants these days?

00:21:13.377 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Implants go all the
way back to Egyptian times.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They actually used to take a
hammer and (CLINKING SOUNDS),

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
stick in a piece of metal in
the person's jaw, all right?

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally
a piece of metal

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that is stuck,
screwed in, tapped in.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
However they do it,
they get it in there.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:84%
The tooth is different
than the rest of the body,

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:84%
because 1/3 of the
tooth is outside

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:90%
of the body, the crown portion.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Right, it is ectodermal
in nature, like our skin,

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
like the mucosal
lining of our mouth.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It is outside the body.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The other 2/3 is
inside the body.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:10%
So when they put a metal implant
in, 2/3 is inside the body,

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:10%
1/3 is outside the body.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
That alone presents a
problem for the body.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Because the collar,
the part that

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
separates the outside
from the inside

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.138 align:middle line:90%
must stay intact at all times.

00:22:09.138 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You mentioned
in one of the other shows

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that the crown and the
metal material Dr. Huggins

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:90%
tracked down to a car lot.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And they were using
bumpers for the metal.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:84%
What kind of metal are they
using in these implants?

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: They're using
titanium primarily.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But here, again, like there's
no such thing as pure gold,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing
as pure titanium.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So you will often
hear a dentist,

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and you'll often hear people
say, but titanium is inert.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:90%
That may be true.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
To a certain extent,
titanium, pure titanium,

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:84%
TI in the elemental chart,
is somewhat inert, not 100%,

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:90%
somewhat inert.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:90%
But it's never pure titanium.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:84%
There's always nickel added
to it, a little bit of silver

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:90%
added to it.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Difference of metals.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:90%
So why is that a problem?

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the minute you have
two different metals in a salt

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:90%
solution, that's a battery.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether
you call it a crown,

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.170 align:middle line:90%
or you call it an implant.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a battery.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you have two different
metals in a salt solution,

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
you have a battery,
which means you're

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:84%
going to have electrons
flowing from high cadence

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.115 align:middle line:84%
to low cadence, or high
valence to low valence.

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm getting a little
technical, a little chemistry

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.290 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But I want people to understand,
you cannot have two different

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:84%
metals in a salt solution,
which is what saliva is,

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:90%
without having a battery.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So now we've got an implant
placed 1/3 out of the body, 2/3

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And it has, within
it, different metals.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's producing its
own electrical field.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, pretty much
everybody knows--

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:10%
I know especially the kind of
people that watch our show,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:10%
everybody knows
that you don't want

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:10%
to stand too close to one of
these high power lines, right?

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:90%
There's electrical lines.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be
too close to them.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to have your
house right underneath one

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%
of these high power lines.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, because besides
the electricity

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:84%
flowing perpendicular
to that electricity

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.940 align:middle line:90%
is an electromagnetic field.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And it is the same
true in the mouth.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:84%
If you have electricity
flowing around an implant,

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:84%
then perpendicular
to that electricity

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.600 align:middle line:90%
is an electromagnetic field.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's about-- is
this four inches?

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:90%
What would you say?

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.617 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Probably,
something like that.

00:24:33.617 --> 00:24:36.445 align:middle line:84%
Then you have your cell phones,
your smart meters, the 5G,

00:24:36.445 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:90%
all the other things.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.487 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: This is about three
inches from your brain.

00:24:39.487 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
have a thought,

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:84%
you have an electrical
current passing

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:84%
from one part of your
brain to the other part.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:90%
So suppose I just had a thought.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
that glass of water.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just passed about
80 nanovolts of electricity

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:90%
across my brain.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But now we've got an implant
less than three inches

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:90%
from the brain.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:10%
And it's producing
millivolts of electricity

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:10%
with a much higher
electromagnetic field.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It's going to affect
the way you think.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Can you just
explain, each tooth is

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:90%
connected to an organ, correct?

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Correct, right.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if you have
a metal going down--

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Through the meridians.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.033 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Through the meridians.

00:25:21.033 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
proven, scientifically.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you put metal down
into the bone, an implant,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.750 align:middle line:84%
will that affect
the organ system

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that that tooth
is connected with?

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Absolutely.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, your
lower first molar

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
is attached, energetically, to
the large intestine meridian.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
If that lower first
molar is root canaled,

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:90%
it's a dead tooth, correct?

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So energy then flows from
the large intestines,

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:90%
goes up through that area.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposed to
flow back and give

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:90%
an equal amount of energy.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But if the tooth is dead, you
have less energy traveling back

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:90%
to the large intestines.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the large intestines
is going to get sick.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what happens
if you have implants

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.103 align:middle line:90%
throughout your whole mouth?

00:26:08.103 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Same thing
with implants.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
You have all this
electricity, all

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:84%
these electromagnetic
fields being interfered with

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:19.605 align:middle line:84%
and interfering the meridians
that run through those areas.

00:26:19.605 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Have
you noticed people

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that have come into you that
have a mouthful of implants,

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.947 align:middle line:84%
and they're suffering from
multiple organ situations?

00:26:26.947 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: I have a patient.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure he would be
free with me discussing this

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:84%
because he's actually written
a book about his own experience

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:90%
in my office.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:10%
I had a patient who
walked into my office

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:10%
with what I would
call tree trunks.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%
He was from Malaysia.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.985 align:middle line:84%
So his skin was a little
bit darker as my skin is.

00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:84%
His skin was a
little bit darker.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:90%
But his legs were scaly.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were so enlarged
that they were this wide.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:27:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So he walked into the office
with what I call tree trunks.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And he could barely fit his
toes into a pair of flip-flops.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
This man had 10
implants in his mouth.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:90%
We removed those implants.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:10%
And normally we like
to do dentistry,

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:10%
we like to do it all in one day.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:10%
It was impossible to
do him all in one day.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
He began having all
kinds of medical issues.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So we really had to
spread his treatment out

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.770 align:middle line:90%
over a longer period of time.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But every time we
removed an implant,

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:90%
he got a little bit better.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And by the time he was ready to
leave and go back to Malaysia,

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:84%
his legs were a normal size,
and they were pink, normal skin

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.780 align:middle line:90%
tone.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Instead of metal, I've
heard of the zirconia implants.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, I think
the jury is still

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:90%
out on zirconia implants.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:90%
They're relatively new.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:10%
We've really only
been doing them here

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:10%
in the United States
about 10 years.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:10%
And so it's interesting.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:90%
You know, zirconium is a metal.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Actually if you see zirconium,
it looks like a black rod.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And they take this
zirconium metal rod

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and put it under high
pressure and high temperature.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking very high,
2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:84%
My brain can't even comprehend
how hot that must be.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:14.697 align:middle line:90%
But that's what they do.

00:28:14.697 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:90%
They put it under high pressure.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And at one point, it pops.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And the moment it pops,
it now becomes a crystal.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.303 align:middle line:90%
It behaves as a crystal.

00:28:22.303 --> 00:28:23.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't pass electricity.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't transmit heat.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:90%
It behaves as a crystal.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.015 align:middle line:84%
So this sounds
wonderful, doesn't it?

00:28:29.015 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I always thought if we were
going to have a good implant,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:90%
it would be a crystal implant.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
had to figure out

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:84%
a way to get the bone to
adhere to this crystal.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
zirconia implants

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:45.130 align:middle line:84%
are coated with aluminum oxide,
which I have a problem with.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And then if the patient
has a large hole,

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:84%
then the doctor will very
often put bone graft material,

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:90%
things like cadaver bone.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:90%
I almost cringe to say it.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Cadaver bone, cow
bone, pig bone.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
They put all these
crazy materials

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.948 align:middle line:84%
into somebody's jawbone,
inside the body.

00:29:05.948 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I keep saying
that over and over again.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Do they
tell them that I'm

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.688 align:middle line:84%
going to put cow bone or
pig bone inside of you?

00:29:11.688 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: I wish they did.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Cause I would
definitely say no.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.877 align:middle line:84%
Very often the
patients don't even

00:29:16.877 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:90%
know they have graft material.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Very often the doctor
will take a tooth out

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and automatically put
in the graft material,

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:84%
should the patient want to
have an implant in the future.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
come to see me I say,

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:84%
well, you got all this
graft material up there.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:90%
They said, what graft material?

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know that
this is what they have.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I wish dentists and patients
would communicate better.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.895 align:middle line:84%
If I had one wish,
it'd probably be that,

00:29:39.895 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:84%
that they would
communicate better.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And so now you've got artificial
graft material and aluminum

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:84%
oxide surrounding this
supposedly OK zirconia implant.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.810 align:middle line:84%
That becomes a
problem for the body.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:54.610 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Because the body is obligated.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the body is
obligated to recognize self

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.270 align:middle line:90%
from not self.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.127 align:middle line:84%
And if it sees non-self,
it has to go after it.

00:30:04.127 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Yeah, like
you said earlier,

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:84%
it's going to keep sending
those immune cells,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.665 align:middle line:90%
sending those immune cells.

00:30:08.665 --> 00:30:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What makes it
so difficult about caring

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.500 align:middle line:84%
for implants and keeping
them up if someone

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:90%
has regular implants?

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, if you think
about it for a second,

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:84%
most of the people
who need implants

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.040 align:middle line:84%
are the same people
who did not take

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:84%
care of the second set of
teeth that God gave them.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, our first set
is our baby teeth, right?

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Then we get one
set of adult teeth.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.550 align:middle line:90%
That's our second set.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And you have to learn how to
take care of them thoroughly

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.043 align:middle line:90%
in order to keep those teeth.

00:30:38.043 --> 00:30:39.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, I often
tell people, you

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.918 align:middle line:84%
don't have to floss
all your teeth,

00:30:40.918 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:84%
just the ones you
want to keep, right?

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, that same
patient is the one

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that's going to have to keep
that implant perfectly clean.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And very often,
it doesn't happen.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.458 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to teach
old dogs new tricks.

00:30:55.458 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, we have a few
pictures of some implants here.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at them.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Oh, good.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And you can talk us
through what we're seeing here.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: All right.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see, this
is a very large implant

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that is supposed to take the
place of the first bicuspid

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:90%
or first premolar.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, I gave
you a quick little lesson

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:84%
on bone anatomy, and I said the
bone is supposed to be white.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yes.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And that's
healthy bone.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a look around
the top of this implant,

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:27.310 align:middle line:84%
you'll see little circles
of black, dark areas, right?

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not healthy bone.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So that would
be an infected area

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:90%
of bone within the implant.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Probably, yeah.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you what
kind of infection

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.907 align:middle line:84%
until I took that implant
out and then sampled it.

00:31:37.907 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: OK, what
about the next one?

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.573 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And then the next
one is another implant.

00:31:41.573 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a look
at the tip of that one,

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
it's actually lying on
top of a white line.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.715 align:middle line:84%
That white line is the
floor of the sinus.

00:31:49.715 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You mean
the one to the left.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: The one
to the left, right.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:90%
That is the floor of the sinus.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So that implant is
actually in the sinus.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And then behind that, the
person has the first molar

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:90%
is root canaled.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, this seems a little
funny, because if you look,

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the root canal filling
material doesn't even

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.608 align:middle line:84%
go to the top of
the tooth, the root.

00:32:09.608 --> 00:32:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's this is a
possibility that that's where

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:13.180 align:middle line:90%
the opening is, but I doubt it.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty far down there.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I see a dark
area of infection

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.960 align:middle line:90%
also at the end of that root.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: OK, what
about this one?

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Whoa, that is a very,
very, very large implant,

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.200 align:middle line:84%
placed in the upper left
portion of the patient's mouth.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And you see the darkness
around the implant?

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The body is already
rejecting that implant.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you take a look
at the whole mouth,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:84%
this person actually has
a pretty healthy mouth.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.100 align:middle line:84%
They've got a lot
of-- all their teeth.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It looks like maybe they're
missing one or two wisdom

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:90%
teeth.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:84%
They pretty much have
all of their teeth.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a healthy person.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So their immune system
is working very well

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.942 align:middle line:84%
and sending tons of
white blood cells.

00:32:59.942 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And the white blood cells
get to the implant and say,

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.000 align:middle line:84%
We're not strong
enough to push it out.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But if we eat up the bone
around it and create a cyst,

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:84%
we can have enough
fluid there where

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.180 align:middle line:90%
the implant will fall out.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what the body does.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Wow, the
body's amazing.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.018 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: It is amazing.

00:33:19.018 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It always wants to take care
of what's a problem, if you

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:90%
give it half a chance.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, here, this is a
picture of two implants

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.920 align:middle line:90%
where the body has rejected it.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:84%
You can see that the gums
are puffy and swollen

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and have literally receded
away from the crown material.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're receding away
from the implant material.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a serious
problem for this patient.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: OK.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUBE: This is
a picture of bone

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:10%
that has microscopic
particles of titanium.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:10%
Titanium is a very
interesting material.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:84%
When it gets disturbed
it produces something

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:01.080 align:middle line:90%
called titanium nanoparticles.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, nanoparticles in
science are the closest thing

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:10%
to Star Wars or Star
Trek that I've seen.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.035 align:middle line:84%
Because now a particle
can move from the tooth,

00:34:13.035 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:84%
shwoop, like that, and
go down into the lungs.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.969 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
see that again?

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Whoop, shwoop.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Instantaneously?

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Instantaneously, right.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Instantaneously.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.159 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't follow blood vessels.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't follow nerves.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even follow energy
patterns from the body,

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:90%
the acupuncture meridians.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:40.469 align:middle line:84%
It translocates from here,
or here, zoop, to the heart,

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:90%
to the kidney.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.699 align:middle line:84%
And you see these
titanium nanoparticles.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:46.559 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's a pretty picture.

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Now, what's
happening here?

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.637 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well,
we've got an implant

00:34:49.637 --> 00:34:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that was removed because the
bone was infected around it.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look at
the picture on the right,

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:84%
you can see that yellow
bone is not normal bone.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.155 align:middle line:90%
That is necrotic bone.

00:35:01.155 --> 00:35:03.288 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.288 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: So the bone is dying.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Oh, yes.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Or it's dead already.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yeah, dead already.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And so here is another example
of an implant that was removed.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that this bone
actually stuck to the implant.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is because
it's not real bone.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.600 align:middle line:90%
It's cadaver bone.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.740 align:middle line:90%
It's some kind of plastic.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It's all kinds of fake
hydroxyapatite crystals.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
stick to the implants,

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:32.500 align:middle line:84%
which it makes it very difficult
for us to get the implants out.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a tugging game
like it is with a normal tooth.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:84%
We actually have to
remove these implants

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:84%
by creating a trough around
the tooth with a laser.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much the way
we get we them out safely.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what's the
alternative to implants?

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Crowns, bridges,
partial dentures.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.752 align:middle line:90%
But I have great news.

00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I know of
two universities.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:90%
There's probably more.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I know of two universities
right now, University of Tampa,

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and Columbia University in
New York City that are doing

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:90%
experiments with stem cells.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
they are actually

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:84%
inserting stem cells
into the jaw of an animal

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and growing a molar
in nine weeks.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Nine weeks.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.075 align:middle line:84%
Now, that molar happens to
look like a cauliflower.

00:36:20.075 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I had my way, I
would take the cauliflower.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:10%
And I know that eventually
they're going to perfect that,

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:10%
probably in 5 to 10 years.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.460 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, it
will be such a disturbance

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to dentistry, because
then the dentists

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.560 align:middle line:90%
will become the stemologist.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.137 align:middle line:84%
When you walk into the dental
office with a large cavity--

00:36:40.137 --> 00:36:41.970 align:middle line:84%
because nobody's going
to stop eating sugar.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.380 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.510 align:middle line:84%
When you walk into the
dentist with a large cavity,

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the dentists of the future
will say, you know what?

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take that tooth out.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll grab some stem
cells from your arm.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And come back in a few weeks
when we have enough stem cells

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:90%
cultured.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.137 align:middle line:84%
We'll inject them right back in
there and grow you a new tooth.

00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:90%
No more root canals.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: That's definitely
something to look forward to,

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.475 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:37:05.475 --> 00:37:07.475 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Yep, I believe
that that is the future.

00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:10.200 align:middle line:84%
They're using stem cells
for so many different things

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.580 align:middle line:84%
now in medicine
and in dentistry.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm really excited.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I hope I live to be long
enough to be a stemologist.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, I've had
some of my teeth extracted.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be coming to you
to get new teeth grown.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:23.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: You're going have
to get in line behind me.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Let's talk about
some of the more misconceptions

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.480 align:middle line:90%
in dental care today.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the more
common recommendations

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that general dentists make that
are wrong, in your opinion?

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Giving fluoride
treatment to little children.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:10%
And usually when the hygienist
does that, she's got a small,

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:10%
kidney shaped bowl
handy, because she

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.660 align:middle line:10%
knows many of those children
are going to throw up.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Why do they throw up?

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Because their body instinctively
knows that they have just

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.030 align:middle line:90%
been poisoned.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:90%
So fluoride is a no-no for me.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:84%
It truly is, unless you
have rats in your building.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Because stannous fluoride
is a very good rat killer.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So unless you have rats,
then fluoride is OK.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's number one.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Number two, where
did we get the idea

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that we should go to
the dentist every six

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.330 align:middle line:90%
months for a cleaning?

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you happen to know that one?

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.493 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: From a TV show?

00:38:17.493 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: A radio show.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.815 align:middle line:90%
You were close.

00:38:18.815 --> 00:38:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: A radio show?

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Yes, used to
be a radio show called

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.180 align:middle line:90%
"Amos and Andy" in the 1950s.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.130 align:middle line:90%
I used to listen to it as a kid.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And the radio show was
sponsored by a toothpaste

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle line:90%
company that no longer exists.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:90%
So I think I can say the name.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It was called
Pepsodent toothpaste.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And they used to sing a jingle
right after the commercial.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.540 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, you wonder
where the yellow

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
went when you brush your
teeth with Pepsodent.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, after one of
those commercials

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Amos asked Andy,
hey, Andy, how often

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.870 align:middle line:90%
should you go to the dentist?

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And Andy said, well,
I don't really know,

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I would probably say
it's every six months.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.900 align:middle line:90%
It became gospel.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:84%
After that, everybody went to
the dentist every six months.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, dentists discovered

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that when the hygienist took her
time and gave you a cleaning,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:84%
she could spend a lot more
time and very carefully

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
look for anything that
was wrong in the mouth.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And that is the true
purpose of hygienists.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know what I just
said now is going to turn

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.530 align:middle line:90%
the dental world upside down.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.010 align:middle line:84%
They're probably going to be
throwing arrows at my back.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.480 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell the truth.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.960 align:middle line:84%
The real purpose
of the hygienist,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:84%
besides cleaning your
teeth and giving you

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.230 align:middle line:84%
hygiene instructions,
is to look and see

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.000 align:middle line:84%
if there's any
dentistry that needs

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to be done in the dental
office by the dentist.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that
that's the truth.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.165 align:middle line:84%
It's the hygienist
that says, oh my,

00:39:50.165 --> 00:39:52.910 align:middle line:84%
you have a crack
here in this tooth.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:55.735 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
tell Dr. Jones about this.

00:39:55.735 --> 00:39:57.570 align:middle line:90%
The patient's heard it once.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.510 align:middle line:10%
Then Dr. Jones walks in
the office and she says,

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.020 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jones, would you please
take a look at tooth number 19?

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:90%
It has a crack in it.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Now the patient
has heard it twice.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jones comes in, takes
a look, and he says, oh my,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.930 align:middle line:84%
my, my, yes, you have a
crack in tooth number 19.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.910 align:middle line:90%
She's heard it now three times.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Then they take a
picture of the tooth,

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and they put it up
on a huge screen.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:26.640 align:middle line:10%
And so this skinny
little crack now

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.340 align:middle line:10%
looks like rock of Gibraltar.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And the dentist says,
probably a good idea for you

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to have a crown
made on this tooth.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Because the tooth is cracked.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:43.208 align:middle line:84%
And if the crack continues,
you're going to lose the tooth.

00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good idea for
you to have a crown done.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Of course, at this point the
patient is scared to death.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they agree
to have a crown made.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's the truth,
everybody over 40

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.660 align:middle line:90%
has cracks in their teeth.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.830 align:middle line:10%
As we get older, that main
canal with the blood vessels

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.440 align:middle line:10%
and all the nutrients that
feed our teeth kind of

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.490 align:middle line:10%
shrinks a little bit.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:84%
It kind of starts
going down the canal

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:90%
when you start getting older.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:90%
And most of us are dehydrated.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that, right?

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And so we do get these
little teeny cracks.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that every tooth
with a crack needs a crown.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.063 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So many
times we hear that we

00:41:20.063 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:84%
have to go get our teeth cleaned
all the time, every three

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.730 align:middle line:90%
months, every six months.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Why do we not?

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.435 align:middle line:84%
And what is your
recommendation on that?

00:41:28.435 --> 00:41:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Personally, I think
it is the most bizarre thing

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:36.310 align:middle line:84%
to go to the dentist and
have them clean your teeth.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
You're expected to take care of
your own mouth hygiene at home.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.690 align:middle line:84%
If you are building up
tartar on your teeth,

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:84%
or what we call calculus,
you are really sick.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Then you do need to
call the dentist.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Then you do need to have a
blood chemistry done, a hair

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.100 align:middle line:90%
analysis, a diet analysis.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.900 align:middle line:84%
We've got to figure
out why you're

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.230 align:middle line:84%
dumping inorganic
calcium in your mouth.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So there's
no preventative care

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that comes with teeth cleaning
in the dentist's office?

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.270 align:middle line:90%


00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: A tooth cleaning is
probably the most invasive

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.520 align:middle line:84%
procedure that can be
committed to a person.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.330 align:middle line:84%
It creates a huge
bacteremia, which

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.450 align:middle line:84%
means a huge amount of
bacteria in the bloodstream.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And most dental offices do
not provide vitamin C IV.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Most dental offices don't
even tell the patient

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:84%
to take an IV vitamin C, or
to take a vitamin C tablet.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.850 align:middle line:10%
For God's sake, do
something, right?

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Most dental offices
don't do that.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they still
commit the procedure.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:84%
They still commit the crime,
increasing the bacteria

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
in the bloodstream,
increasing the possibility

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.400 align:middle line:84%
of the patient having
a heart attack,

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.380 align:middle line:84%
not that night,
seven days later.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.247 align:middle line:90%
Seven days later.

00:42:57.247 --> 00:42:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what are your top
recommendations for dental self

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:00.660 align:middle line:90%
care?

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Self care?

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Self care.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Irrigate
with sodium ascorbate.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Where do you
get sodium ascorbate?

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Health food store.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Sodium ascorbate.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.040 align:middle line:84%
You put a little less
than a pinky's worth

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.510 align:middle line:90%
into the warm water.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Irrigate your teeth.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Floss your teeth.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Brush your teeth with
salt and baking soda.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you like
toothpaste, afterwards, you

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.230 align:middle line:90%
like that minty taste?

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Brush your teeth
with toothpaste.

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.510 align:middle line:84%
But for God's sake, stay
away from the sugar.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I've had patients who
brush their teeth like crazy,

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.250 align:middle line:90%
but they eat so much sugar.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And they drank Mountain Dew.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:90%
And they drink Gatorade.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And they drink all
these sugary drinks.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
going to get cavities.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you have patients
who don't eat any sugar

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:90%
and hardly brush their teeth.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.250 align:middle line:90%
They don't get cavities.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.500 align:middle line:90%
It's the sugar.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Just like when Louis Pasteur
was on his deathbed--

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and he was the one who told
us about the germ theory.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But on his deathbed he
said, it's the host.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.030 align:middle line:90%
It's the host.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.990 align:middle line:90%
It's the host.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: The germ is nothing.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:03.775 align:middle line:90%
The terrain is everything.

00:44:03.775 --> 00:44:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: The terrain
is everything.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to the
mouth, it's the sugar.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.430 align:middle line:90%
It's the sugar.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the sugar.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So people are going to
be wondering-- they're probably

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:84%
saying, oh, my gosh,
my dentist has been

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.900 align:middle line:90%
doing this wrong my whole life.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.810 align:middle line:90%
How do I find somebody like you?

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.330 align:middle line:84%
How do I find a
biological dentist

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that can explain all
these things to me,

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and that can take care of
my teeth the natural way?

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Right,
well, my favorite--

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.550 align:middle line:84%
there are probably
three organizations

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.230 align:middle line:84%
in the United States that
have holistic or biological

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:37.030 align:middle line:90%
dentists.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.540 align:middle line:90%
My favorite one is IABDM.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:44.230 align:middle line:10%
And the website,
you go to IABDM.org.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:47.890 align:middle line:10%
We have a list of biological
dentists, biological, board

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.250 align:middle line:10%
certified biological dentists.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.662 align:middle line:10%
The second organization
is called IAOMT.

00:44:54.662 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry I have to give
you all these letters.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.620 align:middle line:10%
Of course, each letter
stands for a word.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.410 align:middle line:10%
You can go to their website and
get a list of their dentists.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:10%
And then the third one is the
Holistic Dental Association,

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.870 align:middle line:10%
which is actually the oldest
organization of the three.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.950 align:middle line:10%
They also carry a list
of doctors who are savvy,

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:14.630 align:middle line:10%
who pretty much understand
that root canals are not

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:15.430 align:middle line:10%
good for you.

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Although, there are some,
quote, mercury free dentists

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.120 align:middle line:90%
that also do root canals.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And they also understand the
whole implant and cavitation

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:23.750 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.458 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what
would be the difference

00:45:25.458 --> 00:45:28.420 align:middle line:84%
between holistic dentists
and biological dentists?

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, the
holistic dentist usually

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.420 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who is mercury
free, same with the IAOMT.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.590 align:middle line:90%
They're mercury free.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:38.260 align:middle line:84%
They know how to remove
mercury fillings.

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The IABDM board certified
biological dentist

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:46.670 align:middle line:84%
does the whole gamut and
understands all of the issues.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if someone's
not able to find, or afford,

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:53.170 align:middle line:84%
a biological dentist,
what would you recommend?

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:54.295 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Get off the sugar.

00:45:54.295 --> 00:45:55.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:56.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the sugar.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: We keep
coming back to sugar.

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Yeah, we keep
coming back to them.

00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:59.855 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Because
it's the root cause.

00:45:59.855 --> 00:46:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Exactly.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I mean, you have
to look at the root cause

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:02.610 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.985 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And it's not just
sugar, sugar, the white sugar.

00:46:04.985 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the pasta.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the white bread.

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:08.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the soda.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the candy.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It's the ice cream.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Just stop.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Was it was Barbara Bush
that said, just say no?

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Just say no.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
most powerful addictions

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.590 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to get off cocaine
than it is to get off sugar.

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to stop smoking
than it is to get off sugar.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But once you get off sugar,
you can actually go 24 hours,

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:35.740 align:middle line:84%
feel your teeth, like I just
did, and go, oh, wait a minute.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.760 align:middle line:90%
They're still nice and smooth?

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.260 align:middle line:90%
There's no fuzzy feeling?

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't have this
plaque buildup.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.040 align:middle line:90%
It's the sugar.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.310 align:middle line:90%
It's the sugar.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:46.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the sugar.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What if somebody
just has a cake once a week

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.810 align:middle line:84%
or has a little bit
of sugar once a week?

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it the amount of sugar?

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it the daily amount of
sugar that's coming in?

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Oh, absolutely.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:00.295 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Or like yes, I'm
going to have some alcohol,

00:47:00.295 --> 00:47:02.430 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to have a
piece of cake once a week,

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.595 align:middle line:84%
and have that treat, and
brush my teeth afterwards.

00:47:04.595 --> 00:47:05.395 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:47:05.395 --> 00:47:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: It's just the
constant bombardment.

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:09.507 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Right, it's the
constant bombardment.

00:47:09.507 --> 00:47:10.860 align:middle line:90%
But if you're going to have--

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.940 align:middle line:90%
it's the 4th of July.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.010 align:middle line:90%
You're going to have ice cream.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:17.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, then, for God's sakes,
take extra minerals that night.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the sugar depletes
your body of minerals.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.480 align:middle line:90%
That's how you get the decay.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to have sugar--

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying on a
daily basis, just once,

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:30.580 align:middle line:84%
take some extra
minerals that night.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.035 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what kind of
minerals does sugar deplete?

00:47:33.035 --> 00:47:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: All of them.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: All of them.

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right, all of them.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And the best
way to get minerals

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is just through a
mineral supplementation?

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Both.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, our
food source doesn't

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.820 align:middle line:84%
carry the amount of minerals
that we need as human beings.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can have the
most pristine diet,

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.550 align:middle line:84%
eat 100% organic, you're
still not getting it all.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:53.380 align:middle line:90%
You still need minerals.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.330 align:middle line:84%
You need to take your
minerals every day.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.130 align:middle line:84%
You need to take your
vitamin C every day.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:59.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I could go on the list.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.015 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: All of the
minerals work together.

00:48:01.015 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That's right.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:02.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I mean,
fulvic acid, humic acid.

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.633 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That's right.

00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Celtic salt.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That's right.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Himalayan
crystal salt,

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:09.670 align:middle line:84%
something that's
going to give you

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.010 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different minerals,
and a good form that you're

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:12.940 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to absorb.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.357 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And you
need all of them.

00:48:14.357 --> 00:48:17.260 align:middle line:84%
You just don't take one mineral
and take a lot of it, no.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:84%
That's going to put your
body out of balance.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if somebody is in
a town, and they can't find,

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.150 align:middle line:84%
or they don't have
a holistic dentist,

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.460 align:middle line:84%
they don't have access
to a biological dentist,

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and they go into their
conventional dentist,

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.310 align:middle line:84%
what should they say or do to
their conventional dentist?

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, number
one, if the dentist

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.260 align:middle line:84%
has to do a procedure,
they should ask the dentist

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.470 align:middle line:90%
to please not use epinephrine.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.815 align:middle line:90%
That would be my first request.

00:48:44.815 --> 00:48:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, before
that, no mercury fillings.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.670 align:middle line:90%
No mercury fillings.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:50.720 align:middle line:90%
No root canals.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And please don't
use epinephrine.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How many holistic or
biological dentists actually

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.840 align:middle line:84%
use Huggins or the new
Huggins Grube protocol?

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Unfortunately
not enough.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I teach it all the
time, but dentists

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:10.200 align:middle line:84%
find it very difficult to really
fulfill the whole protocol.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So that's really
what sets you apart.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: From a
lot of the others.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: They get pressured.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:90%
And I understand it.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:84%
They get pressure
from the patients.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.530 align:middle line:84%
They get pressure from
the insurance companies.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:20.420 align:middle line:84%
They get pressure
from the state board.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.130 align:middle line:84%
They get pressure
from their wives.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.140 align:middle line:84%
They get pressure
from their husbands.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.300 align:middle line:90%
You know, I understand it.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What do
you most hope will

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:33.410 align:middle line:90%
change in the dentistry field?

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: I want to see an
immediate ban on mercury.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.980 align:middle line:84%
We had a convention
in Minimata, Japan

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.350 align:middle line:90%
approximately five years ago.

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:46.670 align:middle line:84%
47 countries, including
the United States

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:52.490 align:middle line:84%
signed a treaty promising
to reduce the use of mercury

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.460 align:middle line:90%
in the world, 47 countries.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.620 align:middle line:84%
The United States was
actually the first country

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.590 align:middle line:84%
to ratify the treaty
and say, yes, we

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:05.600 align:middle line:84%
are going to begin to
eliminate the spread of mercury

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.813 align:middle line:90%
in our environment.

00:50:06.813 --> 00:50:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first
things that happened

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.970 align:middle line:84%
was the United
States passed a law

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:14.510 align:middle line:84%
saying that all dentists have
to have an amalgam separator,

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.510 align:middle line:90%
I believe by July 1 of 2020.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:10%
They all have to have
an amalgam separator

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:23.720 align:middle line:10%
so that we're not putting more
mercury into our environment.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:29.400 align:middle line:10%
I want to see mercury banned
altogether, worldwide.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I would love to see
that before I go on to--

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:34.875 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, the dental
office in the sky.

00:50:34.875 --> 00:50:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I would
love to see that too.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yeah.

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Just out of curiosity,
who does your dental work?

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Actually,
Dr. David Villarreal

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.140 align:middle line:84%
is an excellent biological
dentist in California.

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.770 align:middle line:84%
He and I were in our first
Huggins class together.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.330 align:middle line:10%
We didn't become
friends right away

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.470 align:middle line:10%
until the second Huggins class.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:53.420 align:middle line:90%
And he came up to me.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.580 align:middle line:90%
He said, hey, I remember you.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:56.880 align:middle line:90%
You were in the first class.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And we were the only two that
had taken the advanced course.

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.000 align:middle line:90%
So we became good friends.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And he is an excellent
biological dentist.

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:04.633 align:middle line:90%
And he does my dentistry right.

00:51:04.633 --> 00:51:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well,
thank you so much,

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Blanche, for sharing
this wealth of knowledge

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:90%
with everybody.

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I am really sure right
now that Dr. Huggins

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.940 align:middle line:84%
is very proud of you, that he
handed that torch over to you.

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So thanks again for sharing
all of your thoughts, all

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.350 align:middle line:90%
of your knowledge with us today.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Thank you.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:26.780 align:middle line:84%
This has been a privilege,
and certainly a pleasure.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.010 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD: Empowered
with this information,

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:32.270 align:middle line:10%
I hope you will make the wise
choices of a truly informed

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.760 align:middle line:10%
patient when faced
with making decisions

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.180 align:middle line:10%
about your dental care,
decisions that will truly

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.360 align:middle line:10%
impact every aspect
of your well-being.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Ed Group.

Thanks for watching
