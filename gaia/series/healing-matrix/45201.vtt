00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Most of the
pain in our lives is the result

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of the interpretation of
past events that became stuck

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:90%
as a truth.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Once the pattern is
entrenched, there's

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:84%
little we seem to be
able to do to shift

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
that hurtful perception, so it
haunts us throughout our lives.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But what if you could reframe
your entire life story?

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
NLP, short for
Neuro-linguistic Programming,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
has been doing this for
hundreds of thousands of people.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Tom Dotz is here to
explain some of the secrets

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
to unlocking painful
perceptions and releasing them

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
from our psyche, which I
don't know a single person

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that
doesn't need to do that

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:90%
at some level or another.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> TOM DOTZ: Absolutely.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some are just
more skilled at burying them

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:90%
permanently.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Going to
denial, whatever.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
But a healthier way to
live is to bring those up

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to the surface and
look at them again.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we're
going to find out,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
there's very little
that is objective truth

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
within our realm of
experience it seems.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: That's quite correct.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
We really live inside
the mental maps or models

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.712 align:middle line:90%
that we've built of reality.

00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It's true right down
to a physical level.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:90%
We don't see with our eyes.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.562 align:middle line:90%
We see with our mind.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: This and many other
things are actually being

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
really validated by the research
that neuroscience has been

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:84%
doing over the last 10 to 15
years since they discovered

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:90%
MRIs and FMRI machines.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting
how many of the realizations

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and lessons that
we've taught in NLP,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
going all the way back to
1974, are being validated

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
by the work in the
neuroscience area.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's talk
about the origins of NLP,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:84%
how it came about, what
it was being applied

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
for in the beginning, and then
move a little bit forward more

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:90%
toward what's happening now.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.223 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Sure.

00:02:08.223 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, it started
out with a group

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
of students and a
professor at UC Santa Cruz

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:90%
back in the mid to early '70s.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were lucky
enough to be connected

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
with a man named
Gregory Bateson, who

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
was a focal point of a lot
of the new thought that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:90%
was being developed at the time.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
He was formerly married
to Margaret Mead, one

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of the foremost
anthropologists in the world.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
He was good friends with both
Milton Erickson, who's probably

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:84%
the greatest hypnotherapist
who ever lived

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and with Virginia Satir,
who was the primary lead

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
developer of Conjoint
Family Therapy.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were also
connected with Fritz Perls.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And so these students were
really interested in how

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
does it work, like
most of us are

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
at some point in our
lives or another.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:84%
How does it work, meaning
all of this and all of this?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:90%
How does it really work?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:90%
How do we navigate through it?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, they
were lucky enough

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to be connected with
these really, really

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
successful people, people who
were really successful, as it

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:90%
happened, in therapy.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
They were all really effective
therapists, far more effective

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
than almost anyone
alive at that time.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did was they
studied the behavioral patterns

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and the language patterns
that these therapists

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
used to create amazing changes
in a tremendously short period

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
of time compared to anything
else that was being done.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
things they did was they

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
studied Milton Erickson's
patterns for resolving phobias.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Now at the time, the only thing
known about curing a phobia

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.742 align:middle line:84%
was constant exposure until
you overcame the stimulus.

00:03:38.742 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Immersion therapy.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: In a way, yeah.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Terrible.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not with
arachnophobia, sorry.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Exactly.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
What, you're going to put me
in a room full of spiders?

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:90%
That's torture.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: That's torture.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Even if I don't
have arachnophobia,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that's not going to
make me happy at all.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.451 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So they studied the
language patterns he used,

00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and he could resolve a
phobia in three sessions.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
They got it down to 15 minutes,
and no one would believe him.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a friend of mine once
went to a phobia conference

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.106 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrated this in front
of a group of psychologists.

00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And when he went to
test it, this woman

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:90%
had a fear of heights.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.772 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of his process,
she said, oh, it's gone.

00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, let's test it.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's walk up to the
roof of the building.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.229 align:middle line:84%
Are you comfortable
with doing that?

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh sure.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, how many of you
would like to go with me

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:90%
and see this?

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:90%
None of them went with him.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.325 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: They weren't willing
to confront the possibility that

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:90%
their beliefs--

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That he
could have done this.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Now did he do this with his kind
of classic induction and using

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.381 align:middle line:90%
ideomotor response?

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: No.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the classic, if you will,
three place disassociation

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.227 align:middle line:90%
VAKD disassociation.

00:04:40.227 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.310 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into that
in a little bit.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Let's just call it
the classic NLP phobia trauma

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And basically, we talk
people through a scenario where

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:84%
they are able to remove that
stimulus from the conditioned

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:90%
response of panic.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.295 align:middle line:84%
So a classic phobia:
see snake, panic, right?

00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So if we can separate
that, we see the snake.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:90%
It's over there.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:90%
It's no threat to us.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a disassociation.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not in the experience
of feeling it again.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm just reliving it, imagining
it, but it's out there.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's essentially
the process.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.945 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We will get
into that in a moment,

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
kind of the sequence of how we
respond to our lives and how

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
these patterns get stuck
there to begin with.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So now when you start
practicing it-- OK.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:84%
First of all, most of us
that have heard of NLP

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
have heard the
simple thing of when

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to access the
past you look up one way.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
When you're trying to move
into the future and creativity,

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.240 align:middle line:90%
you look up another way.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:84%
That's all most people have
even thought about NLP.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.340 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
early discoveries

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
that they used primarily as
a research tool and learning

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:90%
tool.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's been widely
misunderstood.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And in a terrible way,
it's been taught as a way

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
to tell if someone's
lying or not.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the big lie.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So talk about that.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Sure, OK.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why did that happen?

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.664 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
stuck out there at large.

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Here's
how it came about.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So it was observed
that most people

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.355 align:middle line:84%
in the American culture-- and
really, specifically, they

00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:14.938 align:middle line:84%
were studying college students
at UC Santa Cruz in California,

00:06:14.938 --> 00:06:16.699 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're smoking
a lot of weed in those days.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.530 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: No doubt.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And experimenting with
many other things.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: It was the '70s.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.396 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I remember
them, sort of.

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And they noticed
that most people,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
if you ask them to imagine
something that they hadn't seen

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:84%
yet, so you're
asking them to create

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.530 align:middle line:84%
a visual image in their
mind's eye, most of them

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
would look up to the right as
they were composing the image

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:84%
or having it come
into their awareness.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you asked
them to imagine,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:84%
for instance, well, what color
was the first car that you ever

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
bought, they'd tend
to look up to the left

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to access a visual
image of a past memory.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And more if they noticed
that if people were talking,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and specifically if they were
having internal dialogue,

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:84%
they'd be looking over this
way to the left at midline.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.617 align:middle line:84%
And if they were
thinking in auditory--

00:07:03.617 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that is talking to themselves
about something that

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.199 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of feeling
involved-- they

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%
might be looking down like this.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.757 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting, if you

00:07:10.757 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
listen to the language
in our culture,

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:90%
it reveals a lot of this.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
When people are really engaged
in an emotional experience,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
they'll be looking
down to the right.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can think
of that expression

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:90%
it's downright solid to me.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.340 align:middle line:90%
It's down right solid.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Downright true.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, did they find
that these patterns were--

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:84%
the percentages were such
that it had validity?

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.077 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: It's cultural
and individual.

00:07:36.077 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So the only way you
can really tell is to be skilled

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
enough to ask people enough
questions to determine whether

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:84%
or not they're going to
look up to the right when

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
they're constructing
a visual image.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where it
really gets tricky.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.365 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- and this is,
again, something neuroscience

00:07:51.365 --> 00:07:54.031 align:middle line:84%
is validating more and more--
our memories don't really

00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We make them up as we're
asked to recall them.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:90%
We imagine a memory.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And you can go to my website.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I've got copies and
links to the articles

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:90%
that neuroscience has validated.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.284 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, a lot of
people, when they

00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:90%
want to remember something--

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're saying it's
like a reconstruction that

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:90%
occurs.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.421 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yes.

00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's not an actual--

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I'm not
going back and--

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --memory.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: --finding a videotape
in my head somewhere, no.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm reconstructing
an experience.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.397 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people
naturally do this.

00:08:19.397 --> 00:08:21.438 align:middle line:84%
They're going to look up
to the right, because it

00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:84%
may help them construct
a visual image.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.106 align:middle line:84%
And other people happen
to look up to the left

00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:27.702 align:middle line:84%
because they can access
them more easily that way.

00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's been greatly
misunderstood as some way

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.524 align:middle line:84%
that you can tell if
someone's lying or not.

00:08:31.524 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And above
and beyond that,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:84%
the first time I was told this,
within five minutes I could

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:84%
make myself look in any
direction at all to see that

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
white Ford that
I bought in 1964.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.118 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:43.118 --> 00:08:44.076 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Piece of cake.

00:08:44.076 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.734 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So if you believe
that's going to enable you

00:08:47.734 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:90%
to detect lies--

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:48.481 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:49.155 align:middle line:90%
So that's dispelled.

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yep.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.253 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, good.

00:08:50.253 --> 00:08:51.977 align:middle line:90%
We've got that right off.

00:08:51.977 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But the whole notion
that you bring up

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
memory per se,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:84%
as in an absolute
film that accurately

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
relays what
happened, but instead

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:84%
we reconstruct, bring in
elements of imagination

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and memory and
cobble them together

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and that becomes the basis of
our reality, that's important.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: It is.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's really useful
in a lot of ways.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
reconstruct your memories

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to give you more confidence,
to give you more satisfaction

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
with life, to just generally
feel better about yourself.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting
that you fool yourself.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But let's take an
experience, for instance.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time you
went skiing, for instance,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't really
get a good instructor.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.095 align:middle line:84%
And it was spring
skiing, and it was icy,

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and you spent a lot of
time falling on your tail.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
That's not the
kind of experience

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.224 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
remember as something

00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that was really
fun and enjoyable.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But you might want
to really remember

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that you learned a
lot about how to fall.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And my god, you could fall
all the way down the hill,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't kill you.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: You know?

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:56.956 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:56.956 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:90%
So reframing that experience.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.093 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:09:59.093 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:84%
That's, in a sense,
reframing, yeah.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
it's interesting.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking if
you had something

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
that was rather unpleasant,
since the whole thing is sort

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of a construct of our
imagination anyway,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.472 align:middle line:84%
why not reconstruct it to
something that was actually

00:10:12.472 --> 00:10:13.805 align:middle line:90%
a little kinder and more gentle?

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yes.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You say you
don't want to fool yourself.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be delusional.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But at what point can
we actually just say,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.192 align:middle line:84%
That memory doesn't work for me,
even if it happened that way.

00:10:24.192 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:90%
I want to reframe that.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose
another reality.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I think at any point
where you decide I've learned

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
everything I can out of reliving
that experience the way it was.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.555 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:38.139 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: It isn't of any
benefit to me or to anybody else

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
to keep beating myself up
with those bad feelings about

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
an experience that happened
x number of days, years,

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:90%
or decades ago.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.839 align:middle line:84%
And so why not just reframe
it and think about, what

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:90%
did I get positive out of that?

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:84%
What did I learn
from that that can

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
help me have more successful
and satisfying experiences

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.186 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a process
called Change Personal History

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that's specifically
developed and patterned

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.244 align:middle line:90%
to do that very thing.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:90%
It's in the book, of course.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the whole notion
that a lot of people say, oh,

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget, that's
really not very healthy,

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.211 align:middle line:90%
to choose to never forget?

00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:11.835 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: There's a lot of things
I'm perfectly happy to forget.

00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.465 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I've learned
everything I can from them.

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.422 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to keep
remembering them.

00:11:15.422 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't do me
or anyone any good

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:84%
to occupy my head rehearsing
a memory, which is actually

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.026 align:middle line:90%
a made-up experience.

00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:25.736 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:25.736 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: To begin with, the
experience we're having right

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.496 align:middle line:84%
now, we're not aware of
everything that's going on.

00:11:30.496 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
For one thing,
our vision doesn't

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
see into the infrared
or the ultraviolet.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Our hearing only
captures a certain range.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
My dog's captures a
much greater range.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We get about 5% of
the reality we're sitting in.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And furthermore, our
minds-- in NLP, by the way,

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
we consider this to be
our mind, the whole thing,

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
our whole neurology.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And NLP, in fact, was
talking about muscle memory

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, and now
it's become more and more

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.015 align:middle line:84%
of a common phrase,
as has reframing.

00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I don't think you ever
saw reframing used in the media

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
30, 20 years ago, but
it's pretty common now,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
especially when politicians
are talking about how

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
they're considering an issue.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They're going to frame the
issue in a certain way.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use compassionate
conservative instead

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:90%
of just conservative.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So we frame the
discussion that way.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But when you use
your memory and claim I'll never

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.350 align:middle line:84%
forget this, in a negative
way there's a certain amount

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
of usually kind of
self-righteousness that goes

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:90%
on with it.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's perpetuating a painful
pattern of blame and judgment

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.457 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:12:34.457 --> 00:12:36.248 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: When it's said
with that tonality,

00:12:36.248 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:90%
that's generally implied, yeah.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget that.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
We're usually saying that
in response to a feeling

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.519 align:middle line:84%
that someone did
something that injured us.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that may have
been misperceived to begin

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I think we've
all had those situations.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Of course.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we uncover the actual
intent of the other party,

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and other times we don't.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.905 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:12:56.905 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.113 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Sometimes
they were confused.

00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:01.912 align:middle line:84%
And in most all cases,
it ain't personal.

00:13:01.912 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.828 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: It's not personal
even when you think it is.

00:13:04.828 --> 00:13:05.852 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Even when it's
your significant other,

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:90%
it may not be personal.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.911 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's like Don
Miguel Ruiz's book "The Four

00:13:10.911 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Agreements," that
wonderful little book,

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.935 align:middle line:90%
so simple and profound.

00:13:13.935 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:18.400 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Do not take things personally.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
Four Agreements.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Don't take things personally,
because usually it's

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:90%
another person's drama.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.780 align:middle line:84%
It's another person's
perceptions playing out.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
You're caught in the
crossfires of it maybe.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we have built
our whole life story

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
based on taking these
things personally.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Sure.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it not personal,
most people the vast majority

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
of the time they're living
inside of their own heads.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.878 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: They're not really
aware very much of what's going

00:13:46.878 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:90%
on outside them.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the jokes
in our field is we

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:84%
don't have to put
people into a trance

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
so much as we've got to
bring them out of one.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Bring them
out of a trance, exactly.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So we can
actually have them present.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, toward
the beginning of the book,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
one of the things you
say, it's more a matter--

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
our reality is more a
matter of how we think.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.106 align:middle line:84%
So explain what that means, not
what we think but how we think.

00:14:07.106 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: The
process of thinking.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things is
the example we just used.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.107 align:middle line:84%
OK, if I just go
through my day assuming

00:14:15.107 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that nobody's
personally attacking me.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
A better way is to say that
behind every behavior is

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:90%
a positive intent.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Whatever someone is doing,
they have a positive intent.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Now it may not match my positive
intent in the situation.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And there we have an
opportunity, perhaps,

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.322 align:middle line:90%
to negotiate.

00:14:29.322 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.655 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:14:30.655 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But rather than
thinking, oh, they're

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:84%
out to get me or they're
out to do me wrong

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the case may be,
boy, the boss is on me again,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and he's just a real
drag, and I don't really

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
want to-- maybe
the job-- see how

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.926 align:middle line:90%
you go off in that direction?

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the guy was frowning
when you walked in the door.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that
can become habitual.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Oh, yes, it can,
especially if it happens one

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%
or two days in a row.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you had
another boss like that.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps whenever you walked
in the door or your father

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
walked in the door, he
had a frown on his face.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Or you had a teacher
who would generally

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.732 align:middle line:84%
have a sour expression when
the class first started.

00:15:06.732 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're taking
these things, now, personally.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.273 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Boom, boom, boom.

00:15:10.273 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
It's become a chain of
a stimulus response.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's the
next part, stimuli, interpret,

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.334 align:middle line:90%
emotion, reaction, right?

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Mm hmm.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.583 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:19.583 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
it, that event,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:90%
and how we pattern ourselves.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:90%
So you see a frown.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:84%
You interpret it as I've
done something wrong

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:90%
or he's mad about something.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a reaction,
an emotional reaction, fear,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
anger, anxiety,
insecurity, or a feeling

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:90%
of wanting to get back at him.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And then you react.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.205 align:middle line:84%
And this is,
basically, the cycle

00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:44.979 align:middle line:84%
that we can describe as the way
people move through the world.

00:15:44.979 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But those are
assumptions all along the way.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yes.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And what would be a little
more elegant perhaps

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:84%
when you walk and your boss
has got a frown on their face

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to actually-- so
what's going on?

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.857 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?-- ask a question.

00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:02.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no law against it.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Don't
assume it's about you.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because you're
probably not the center of his

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:05.855 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:16:05.855 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And a
question like that,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to ask yes or no,
like are you having a bad day?

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:84%
You want to ask,
what's going on?

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:90%
You want an open-ended question.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: There's a lot about
the use of language in NLP.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And we've taken
what we think are

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
the essential bits and
the most usable for anyone

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:90%
and put them in the book.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
times when you want

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to ask open-ended questions
and times where you don't want

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:90%
to ask open-ended questions.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And a lot of times
we find that asking a process

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:84%
question like how is vastly
more useful than asking why.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
If you get why,
you get a reason.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
If you ask, how did you
come to that conclusion,

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
then you can understand
their process.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
How did they come
to that conclusion?

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I
saw the boss frown,

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:84%
so I figured once again
he's upset about the numbers

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
he got yesterday,
and so I'd better

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:90%
hide and lay low all day, right?

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Instead of, oh, no, I'm fine.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.579 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the
numbers weren't bad.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But I just got a
little bit of an upset.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Something I ate for
breakfast is bothering me.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.232 align:middle line:90%
It can be as different as that.

00:17:15.232 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're torturing ourselves
with these made-up scenarios

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.795 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:17:19.795 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.919 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going to say
in a little bit I'd like to do

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
just a little kind of thumbnail
sketch of what a session would

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:84%
be like, one that you call your
Circle of Excellence so you can

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:84%
step into this alternate reality
that you create for yourself.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's talk
a little bit about,

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.952 align:middle line:84%
in your terminology, what
is distortion and deletion?

00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So distortion and
deletion is basically what

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
happens in terms of how our
mind effects our perceptions.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So distortion,
generalization, I see

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.970 align:middle line:84%
one example-- and
a generalization

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:90%
is an example of distortion.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So I see one example of
a snake biting someone,

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're traumatized, and
they're taken to the hospital.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm using a very dramatic
example intentionally.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.734 align:middle line:84%
And I generalize from there
to all snakes are dangerous,

00:18:10.734 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and anyone who gets
too close to a snake

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.092 align:middle line:90%
is going to go to the hospital.

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's a deletion in the
form of a generalization.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's the
beginning of a phobia,

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like,
too in that case.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Well, it could
very well be, yeah.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a story on
the site, by the way,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
about a woman who
had a phobia of bees.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.309 align:middle line:84%
And the founder of our
organization, Steve Andreas,

00:18:28.309 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
took her through the
phobia trauma process.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And this was a lifelong
phobia she'd had.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:90%
She was in her 30s at the time.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:90%
And he resolved it.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And you could see clearly
in her face the difference.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:84%
25 years later, he
came across her again,

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and he did a
follow-up interview.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
It's never bothered
her in 25 years.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the knocks about
NLP is that it's a quick fix.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.414 align:middle line:90%
Well, a 25-year fix?

00:18:52.414 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll take all you got.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a good fix.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
a good quick fix.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.395 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: That's
a good quick fix.

00:18:57.395 --> 00:19:00.065 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So going back
to distortion and deletion,

00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:90%
there's a distortion.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So deletion
is real simple.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I can give you some
really simple examples.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to somebody
talk, and I'm not

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.476 align:middle line:90%
hearing everything they say.

00:19:07.476 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm deleting.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I respond to is
what actually, not only do

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.316 align:middle line:84%
I hear it, but it
enters my consciousness

00:19:14.316 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and I actually hear
the words they said

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:90%
and not what I think they said.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.510 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of cases, listening
to people, particularly people

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:84%
you've been in a
relationship with,

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
you've known them for a while,
they'll start a sentence,

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.472 align:middle line:84%
and you hear what they
said the last time

00:19:28.472 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:90%
or maybe the time they said--

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or you make
an assumption that's what

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:90%
they're going to say.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We all do that, yeah.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.009 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of cases,
we're not listening at all

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
because we're figuring out
what we're going to say next.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.689 align:middle line:90%
That's the classic, isn't it?

00:19:40.689 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know what?

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what I love about this
job is that that's something

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
we all tend to do
as human beings.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
But doing what I
do for a living,

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.347 align:middle line:84%
I cannot afford to jump
ahead and try to complete

00:19:53.347 --> 00:19:55.430 align:middle line:84%
someone's sentence in my
mind because I'm thinking

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.471 align:middle line:84%
of something or I miss
what they're going to say.

00:19:57.471 --> 00:20:00.034 align:middle line:84%
So this is a wonderful--
become a journalist.

00:20:00.034 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: There you go.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Do interviews.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a
wonderful discipline--

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: That's right.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to study NLP.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --so that
you can't do that.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Get a job as
a journalist and start

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.855 align:middle line:90%
interviewing people.

00:20:07.855 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.358 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I'll take a page
from your book on that one.

00:20:10.358 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:90%
But I do notice that.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Still in real life, if
I'm familiar with someone

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not doing this directly,
that same propensity is back,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:90%
just like with all of us.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Oh, sure.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I say,
oh, that person.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I know what they're
going to say.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
They always say it that way.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I'm taking
my daughter to school,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and five minutes into the drive
I don't hear another word she

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:90%
says.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And we get there and she goes,
and so tomorrow'll be OK?

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.262 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:20:33.262 --> 00:20:33.886 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Huh?

00:20:33.886 --> 00:20:34.798 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Uhhh.

00:20:34.798 --> 00:20:35.827 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:20:35.827 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to do that
very often with your kids

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.065 align:middle line:84%
or you lose a lot
of credibility.

00:20:39.065 --> 00:20:39.731 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:39.731 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed
to know better.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: That's right.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, of course,
my daughter's

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.116 align:middle line:84%
34 now, so that was
quite some time ago.

00:20:45.116 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So we all do it.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:90%
So deletion just in summary?

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Deletion and
distortion, generally speaking,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
what you don't observe

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
because your
attention is internal

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:84%
or because you're distracted
or because you simply literally

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.420 align:middle line:90%
can't hear what they're saying.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But mostly it's
because of biases

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that we've picked up through
our personal life history,

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:84%
so biases towards assuming
that we know what they're

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
going to say, for
instance, assuming

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that all young people are
going to be interested in

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.521 align:middle line:84%
is what their
friends have to say

00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't possibly be
interested in what I've

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:84%
got to say, that
politicians are always

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.175 align:middle line:84%
going to have one ax to grind
or another depending on what

00:21:26.175 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:84%
party they're in, so we don't
have to listen to what they

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
say, right down to
the level, as I said,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:90%
of our physical perceptions.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:84%
We can't see into the
infrared or the ultraviolet.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
We can't hear above or
below a certain range.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We can't feel more
than a certain amount.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's really interesting.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
When I was taking an
experimental psychology class,

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the little things we did
that absolutely blew my mind

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:84%
was to test how
big of a difference

00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
between the separation
of two points.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.549 align:middle line:84%
And to my utter astonishment--
I couldn't believe it

00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
until I'd done it
about three times--

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I could sense a finer
difference with my fingertip

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.942 align:middle line:84%
than I could detect
with my eyes.

00:22:07.942 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.483 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:22:09.483 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From that field,
the energy in that field.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: It was simply
had two needles,

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and they would be brought
together until you

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
couldn't feel that
there were two of them.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you did the same
thing, take the two needles,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.537 align:middle line:84%
bring them closer together,
you could feel a smaller

00:22:27.537 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:90%
difference, like one millimeter.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.372 align:middle line:84%
With my eyes, I
wouldn't be able to see

00:22:31.372 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
the difference of
maybe five millimeters.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.465 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: But my finger could
detect a difference as small

00:22:35.465 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:90%
as one millimeter.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting that that
field was able to perceive it.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.196 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So really what's
happening is we're going

00:22:41.196 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
through life, because
of prejudices, beliefs,

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:84%
biases of all kinds,
deleting reality,

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
deleting what's right
in front of us as we go.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We only take in a very,
even smaller bandwidth

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.858 align:middle line:90%
than missing the other 95%.

00:22:53.858 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Mm hmm.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:84%
We build up a series
of generalizations,

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.447 align:middle line:90%
and we need to.

00:22:58.447 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to figure out how
to tie our shoes every time we

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:90%
put them on.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So we build up generalizations
about how the world works,

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
our experience, and
how to move through it.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
efficiency strategies,

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:90%
but they become misapplied.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:90%
We start using them everywhere.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.695 align:middle line:84%
It's like the old story
of if all you've got

00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:90%
is a hammer everything's a nail.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So we misuse these by applying
them where they don't belong.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's where generalization
can be a real trap

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and not hearing what
people are actually saying,

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:84%
deleting parts of
our experience.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.751 align:middle line:84%
Being in denial about something
is a classic way of phrasing

00:23:32.751 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:84%
That's a massive
deletion, if you will.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And so one of the
things that NLP helps us learn

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:84%
how to do again is to be aware
of when those generalizations

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
don't apply and when to
gather more information.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
A really big, big
part of NLP is just

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
the basics of learning how to
gather accurate information so

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:84%
that we can keep our
navigation system, if you will,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:84%
for navigating through
our lives tuned up.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would think one
symptom you would see is,

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:84%
if you've gone into the world
of generalization too far

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.349 align:middle line:84%
and preferences, is that your
world has become more and more

00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:11.015 align:middle line:90%
and more narrow.

00:24:11.015 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're experiencing
a very small band of life.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yep.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You only take this
route to go to the store.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
You only buy this
range of foods.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
You only like to
hear these ideas

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:90%
and speak with these people.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with a
tiny, tiny little world--

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yes, exactly.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.561 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --as a function of
all these things you've talked

00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:29.060 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.643 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:24:29.643 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
You're living a very
small life, and you're not

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.054 align:middle line:84%
savoring everything
that's out there.

00:24:34.054 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so NLP can help
broaden that back out again

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:84%
by looking at all these
assumptions and distortions

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:90%
and deletions.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: That's right.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
section in there

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.637 align:middle line:84%
on language, the Meta Model
section in particular,

00:24:45.637 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that teaches you a
series of questions

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
you can use to apply
to your own thinking

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
to break free from some
of those past patterns,

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
the conditioning you
had from the past,

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:84%
the stories that were told by
your parents, by your siblings,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:84%
by the great wisdom of
your 17-year-old friends

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.224 align:middle line:84%
that's still is operating
part of your life.

00:25:06.224 --> 00:25:07.015 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:07.015 --> 00:25:08.142 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah, right.

00:25:08.142 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's do a little
exercise that you

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.471 align:middle line:90%
call the Circle of Excellence.

00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:84%
It's really best to
do this when you've

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:90%
got some space and standing up.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: But I'll try--

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.146 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can we just kind
of mentally go through it?

00:25:21.146 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that just briefly?

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.961 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Let's talk
about excellence,

00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:90%
a state of excellence.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So think of what does a state
of excellence mean to you?

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think excellence
means to be fully engaged.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Let me suggest this.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Think of a particular
context, something

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:90%
you have to do consistently.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.541 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.384 align:middle line:84%
Now what would a state of
excellence be in that context?

00:25:47.384 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To know that you've
been fully engaged and done

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:90%
your best at that thing.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:90%
So fully engaged.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.565 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So you would
be fully engaged,

00:25:54.565 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and that would be a
state of excellence.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to imagine
a circle in front of you

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
right now and that circle
was filled with engagement,

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.166 align:middle line:84%
if it had a color,
what color would it be?

00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, the first color
that came to mind was actually

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:90%
red, a very motivating color.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: That's the one.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, is it?

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: The first one that
comes to mind is the one.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:13.445 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:26:13.445 --> 00:26:13.945 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:13.945 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So just imagine that
this circle is full of red,

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's engagement.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.077 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to step into
that right now in a moment.

00:26:22.077 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Now if you were stepping
into that right now

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and you were standing
in that circle

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and the red started
coming up for you

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and filling you up from
the toe to the head,

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:90%
that full sense of engagement--

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very energizing.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.153 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:26:34.153 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And now if you were to step out
of that circle for a minute--

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:41.189 align:middle line:84%
and what was that city you
lived in before you moved here?

00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:41.730 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So now what other
qualities might really

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:50.364 align:middle line:84%
enhance that state of excellence
for that particular thing

00:26:50.364 --> 00:26:51.655 align:middle line:90%
that you have to do frequently?

00:26:51.655 --> 00:26:54.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I don't know if I'm
not understanding the question.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.772 align:middle line:90%
So engagement is one thing.

00:26:59.772 --> 00:27:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: What other emotional
qualities might really enhance

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.870 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.786 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Enthusiasm.

00:27:03.786 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Enthusiasm, yeah.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's just imagine
that along with engagement

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:90%
we have enthusiasm there.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.509 align:middle line:84%
Now what kind of color
might that bring up?

00:27:11.509 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That brings up
more of a yellow color.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: All right.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So now imagine that this
circle has a red base

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and it has yellow.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you step into it,
the red fills you up,

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.177 align:middle line:84%
and then the yellow comes up,
filling you up again, too.

00:27:25.177 --> 00:27:27.635 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that brings a
level of joy, that enthusiasm.

00:27:27.635 --> 00:27:28.885 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Isn't that wonderful?

00:27:28.885 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.385 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Now as you step out and
think about that and you think

00:27:32.385 --> 00:27:35.362 align:middle line:84%
in the future to the next time
you actually have to do that,

00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
what will it be like if that
circle is right there and you

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.222 align:middle line:90%
step right into it?

00:27:39.222 --> 00:27:40.346 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:27:40.346 --> 00:27:42.175 align:middle line:84%
So you create this
little container

00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
or a platform for yourself with
these already charged colors,

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.335 align:middle line:90%
emotions, and feelings?

00:27:46.335 --> 00:27:47.159 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Mm hmm.

00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:47.825 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Cool.

00:27:47.825 --> 00:27:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And through
repetition, I assume, boom,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.276 align:middle line:84%
it's just like stepping in
and out of a new reality.

00:27:52.276 --> 00:27:53.255 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Sure.

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very cool.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's simple.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: It's very simple.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like it,
especially as a demonstration.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.794 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: You can
do this at home.

00:28:00.794 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:90%
The write-up's in the book.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.771 align:middle line:90%
It's on my website.

00:28:02.771 --> 00:28:04.546 align:middle line:84%
I actually created
a special website

00:28:04.546 --> 00:28:07.004 align:middle line:84%
for the book that's linked from
my main website, nlpco.com.

00:28:07.004 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It's eg.nlpco.com,
and you actually

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:84%
have all the
instructions, and you

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.240 align:middle line:84%
can watch demonstrations done
by a friend of mine Tom Best,

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
who's one of the finest
trainers we ever had.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.699 align:middle line:84%
And that is something,
yeah, it's wonderful.

00:28:25.699 --> 00:28:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've just
written it down,

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.448 align:middle line:84%
so I can go back and play
with this in my head later.

00:28:29.448 --> 00:28:30.274 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:28:30.274 --> 00:28:30.940 align:middle line:90%
You'll enjoy it.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, I already did.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And the wonderful
thing about this circle,

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.616 align:middle line:90%
it goes with you everywhere.

00:28:34.616 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: It's
completely portable.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.355 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:28:38.355 --> 00:28:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And you don't
need anything but your own

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:40.719 align:middle line:90%
neurology.

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: No application needed.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's visceral,
because you're using

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
highly-charged words, and
you're using colors to support

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:90%
the words.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: That's right.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:50.829 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So cool.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for doing that.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.383 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Sure.

00:28:54.383 --> 00:28:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's
talk a little bit about--

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:84%
we all deal with this-- what
representational modalities are

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:03.774 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:29:03.774 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the developers
of NLP was a linguistic.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:84%
He was a professor of
linguistics at the University

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:84%
of California Santa
Cruz named John Grinder.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So since he was a
linguist, he liked

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to use very, very
sophisticated words

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to describe what are fairly
ordinary experiences.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTZ: So, a representational
modality simply means--

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.440 align:middle line:90%
modalities are our senses, okay.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, we'll freely
limit ourselves to the five

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:84%
that we really all agree we
have: sight, hearing, smell,

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:84%
taste, and feeling,
touch in particular.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So representational modality
is simply how do you

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:84%
prefer to represent
your experience

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.460 align:middle line:90%
for a particular context?

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So in the context of
this conversation,

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:84%
if I was to reflect
on it later, I

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:90%
would reflect on it auditorily.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd think about what we said
and how your voice sounded

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.790 align:middle line:84%
so that if I was building
up a representation again,

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.175 align:middle line:90%
it would be a story.

00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where if I were
thinking about the experience,

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:90%
it would be a feeling.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.409 align:middle line:84%
How did I feel when
I was doing this?

00:30:08.409 --> 00:30:09.575 align:middle line:90%
So would that be a modality?

00:30:09.575 --> 00:30:10.219 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:30:10.219 --> 00:30:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Feeling?

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So you think about
it, and you have a kinesthetic,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.810 align:middle line:90%
we'd say.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.912 align:middle line:90%
You have a feeling about it.

00:30:15.912 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You think back, wow,
that was really fun.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:90%
It was really engaging.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It was enjoyable.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.644 align:middle line:84%
Looking forward to
the next one, right?

00:30:21.644 --> 00:30:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm dropping a
hint or anything, of course.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, there you go.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: That's what we mean
by representational modalities.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Everybody uses all of them.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.940 align:middle line:84%
We have preferences
in different contexts.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if I'm eating a
meal at a wonderful restaurant,

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to really
hope that I'm

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.454 align:middle line:90%
in my olfactory and gustatory.

00:30:41.454 --> 00:30:42.745 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And gustatory, yeah.

00:30:42.745 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, my smell and my taste.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm certainly going to
represent it visually too,

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:51.190 align:middle line:84%
because a great meal is usually
a visual delight as well

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.590 align:middle line:84%
as an olfactory and
gustatory delight.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And we can also sequence these
to build our experiences,

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and we do.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we build a
representation or a memory,

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have a
sequence like I saw the menu.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
well, that combination

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:84%
of flavors, that ought
to be interesting.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I can just smell the
rosemary in that,

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and it really works good
with the turkey, as I recall.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm talking to myself, but I
started with the visual access.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I went to my memory of
a smell, of a fragrance,

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and I put it together and
thought of how it would taste.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm representing
it in what's

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.240 align:middle line:84%
called the gustatory
or the taste sense.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
representational modality,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's a series
or a sequence.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.855 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we build our
internal map of reality.

00:31:40.855 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's kind of
interesting to just take

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.500 align:middle line:84%
the time to watch your process
of how you're engaging with

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.350 align:middle line:84%
life and see what your
principal modalities are, right?

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.131 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:31:51.131 --> 00:31:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Although NLP was
really, as I said,

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:84%
originally developed by modeling
really effective therapists.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And mostly it was taught in the
context of therapy or somebody

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:90%
working with somebody else.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.564 align:middle line:84%
It's really useful to
apply it to yourself.

00:32:05.564 --> 00:32:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Because if you want to
increase your self-awareness,

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.356 align:middle line:84%
this is a really
powerful way to do so.

00:32:09.356 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and
the book is really good.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:90%
It says it's an essential guide.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It is an essential
guide, to take a person

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.140 align:middle line:90%
through this themselves.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.806 align:middle line:84%
If you don't necessarily
need to or want

00:32:17.806 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
to go to a therapist
of some kind,

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.435 align:middle line:84%
you give people the tools to
be able to do this themselves--

00:32:22.435 --> 00:32:23.019 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:32:23.019 --> 00:32:25.226 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and have these
recognitions of their own

00:32:25.226 --> 00:32:26.230 align:middle line:90%
patterns and so forth.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.453 align:middle line:84%
We went through the whole
field, and we picked out

00:32:28.453 --> 00:32:31.250 align:middle line:84%
what we felt was most
important and most accessible

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.360 align:middle line:84%
for people without
having a personal coach

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:90%
or going to a training.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So you get some amazing tools
in there that you can DIY.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:90%
You can do it yourself.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And as I said,
I've got a website

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
that provides even
more support for that.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
answer our email.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We respond if people
have questions.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, there
was one thing you talked about

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:84%
in there, which was an
anchoring event that we've all

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.170 align:middle line:90%
experienced.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.837 align:middle line:84%
And you talked
about when you met

00:32:55.837 --> 00:32:57.670 align:middle line:84%
the woman who was going
to become your wife.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's actually
Tom Hoobyar's story.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That wasn't yours.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:00.950 align:middle line:90%
That's Tom's.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:01.780 align:middle line:90%
I misinterpreted it.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:01.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: We're both
Tom, just to make it--

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The other Tom.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: --really clear, right?

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So talk about
Tom's experience and how we--

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.585 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Tom's experience was so

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --all
experience this.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.568 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: --great.

00:33:08.568 --> 00:33:09.300 align:middle line:90%
We all do this.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:09.966 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:09.966 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So he was having
a meal, having a lunch,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it was, with Vikki, who
the woman who became his wife.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.766 align:middle line:84%
And it was, I think, the
first or second date.

00:33:18.766 --> 00:33:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And as they were
sitting together

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and they're having
a really good time

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.425 align:middle line:84%
and it's going really nicely,
she'd keep reaching over to him

00:33:24.425 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and touching him on
the arm and saying,

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.740 align:middle line:84%
oh, Tom, it was
the funniest thing.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So whenever she was leading
off into a new story,

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.180 align:middle line:84%
a new anecdote, she would use
this phrase and touch him.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And that formed what
we call an anchor.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And because it was a combination
of touch, voice tone,

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and content, it became
a really powerful one.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then, for
as long as he was alive,

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:90%
he would remember that.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And whenever he
was touched there,

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.210 align:middle line:84%
it would re-access
those great feelings.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So whenever Vikki touched
him there, not me.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Whenever Vikki would
touch him there,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.620 align:middle line:84%
it would re-access
and re-evoke--

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The freshness of
the new love and everything.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.324 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:33:57.324 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Now isn't that a
delightful thing?

00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Now is this something we
can program consciously?

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about a
conscious use of anchoring

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:84%
something in that we
need for our own benefit

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK, sure.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.256 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Circle of
Excellence was an example.

00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:10.845 align:middle line:90%
That is an anchoring process.

00:34:10.845 --> 00:34:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And it's considered
a spatial or kinesthetic

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.393 align:middle line:84%
anchoring process, because
you're creating two different

00:34:16.393 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:90%
spaces, moving back and forth.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
And also the best way to
do it is to be standing up

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
and really imagine that circle
on the floor in front of you.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.282 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And step in it.

00:34:25.282 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: And step into it.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And then when you've got the
feeling fully, then step out.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Distract yourself for a moment.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's what we call a
separator state, just

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.310 align:middle line:84%
to clearly isolate all
those feelings that you

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.701 align:middle line:90%
want to be able to access.

00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:40.159 align:middle line:84%
You want them right
in that circle,

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and you want it clear
and clean and specific.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:47.194 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, when I think
about doing my yoga practice

00:34:47.194 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:84%
and I set up a
circle of excellence,

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that the qualities
I want there are focus,

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and I want calmness,
and I want my attention

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to be able to shift from the
instructor's words externally

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:90%
to my own words internally.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'll start building those
in there, and then I'll step in

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.305 align:middle line:90%
and just feel that fully.

00:35:10.305 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I step out and
I think of something else

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to distract myself, my phone
number backwards, or whatever.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:90%
And then I look again.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.094 align:middle line:90%
Does that draw me forward?

00:35:20.094 --> 00:35:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And then what I
do is I'm imagine,

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Wednesday afternoon I'll
be going to my Wednesday yoga

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:84%
class, and I'm going
to have that circle.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And the color of
it for me is green.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have
my green circle,

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be right
over my mat, whatever

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:90%
color my mat may be.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll probably try
to find a green one,

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:44.340 align:middle line:84%
but whatever color
that mat is, I'll

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.481 align:middle line:84%
have my Circle of
Excellence right there.

00:35:46.481 --> 00:35:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And so when I step onto that
mat, I'm going to step in

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and re-access those states
of focus, relaxation,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.114 align:middle line:90%
and attention.

00:35:55.114 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.180 align:middle line:90%
That's really amazingly simple--

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:58.995 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: It is.

00:35:58.995 --> 00:35:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --but effective.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: It's really effective.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you how
to make it ineffective,

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.910 align:middle line:90%
but I'd rather now.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, now in amongst
all of this too,

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
you say when you're approaching
this subject it really

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:90%
helps us to have curiosity.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now a lot of us
lose our curiosity as we fall

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.880 align:middle line:90%
into patterns in life.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned before
when you've narrowed

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.170 align:middle line:84%
yourself down this little shoot
where you've become habitual

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and the curiosity
starts shutting down.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
why we need curiosity

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and how to open
that back up again

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.440 align:middle line:84%
for people who've shut
down on themselves.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Ah.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Curiosity is really one of the
most powerful learning states

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:37.780 align:middle line:90%
there is.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.547 align:middle line:84%
I'm a real fan of learning,
because otherwise, yeah,

00:36:41.547 --> 00:36:43.380 align:middle line:84%
your life is just going
to say where it was.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't want to manage
my life with the absolute level

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.170 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge I
had when I was 25.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With a couple
tools in the box, yeah.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.431 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to keep
learning, especially

00:36:51.431 --> 00:36:53.490 align:middle line:84%
because there is so much
more to learn every day.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And curiosity's a
powerful draw for that.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
things that we can really

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%
use as a resource state
when we get stuck.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of anchoring, one
of the really useful things

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.265 align:middle line:84%
is to set up a sequence of
anchors, which we explain

00:37:08.265 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:84%
in the book, and it's basically
what we were starting to do

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and did there with the Circle
of Excellence demonstration,

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.730 align:middle line:84%
is to set up a
sequence of anchors

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
so that when a certain
trigger happens,

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:23.635 align:middle line:84%
instead of getting resentful or
angry or scared or insecure--

00:37:23.635 --> 00:37:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or closing down.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: --closing
down, going into denial,

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:90%
you get curious about it.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.965 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To open up your
attention outside of yourself

00:37:32.965 --> 00:37:33.506 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:37:33.506 --> 00:37:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I wonder
what caused that.

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.507 align:middle line:84%
Curiosity will draw
our attention outward,

00:37:38.507 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's a lot
more useful than just

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:84%
sitting here and being
mired in my own--

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But what's happened
to society at large is

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:48.640 align:middle line:84%
it's become so
kind of egocentric,

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:54.410 align:middle line:84%
in a functional way, that so
often I notice people will not

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:84%
ask a question
outside of themselves.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is really--
it's kind of a disturbing

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:01.960 align:middle line:90%
trend.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
You'll see a group
of people speaking,

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and no one's asking
anyone any questions.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Mm hmm.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.427 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:07.427 --> 00:38:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's just waiting for
the one to finish long enough

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.697 align:middle line:84%
to cut in, cut in,
cut in, cut in.

00:38:11.697 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know what I mean?

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.760 align:middle line:84%
That's a conversation I probably
wouldn't have a lot of fun

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.325 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:38:16.325 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: People are
playing one-up games.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.639 align:middle line:84%
Or I just want to be able to
make the next clever comment.

00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I want to just be able to make
the next impressive statement.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:24.680 align:middle line:90%
I want to--

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.721 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But when I
overhear people everywhere,

00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.200 align:middle line:84%
at the airport, everywhere,
that seems to be the nature

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:90%
of conversation.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It seems as though our
curiosity has somehow

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.720 align:middle line:90%
been dampened our obscured.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't quite understand that.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But even just with your
saying those words to say,

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.360 align:middle line:90%
hmm, how did that happen?

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's an immediate
drawing out of yourself

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
into the external and outside
world that can be enchanting,

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.630 align:middle line:84%
it can be whatever, but
drawing yourself out.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.511 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Right.

00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's why you
say curiosity is such a key

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.440 align:middle line:84%
component to this
kind of healing?

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: It helps us get outside
of ourselves and frees us from

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:90%
being stuck.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.715 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: It's a very
powerful tool for that.

00:39:05.715 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And I think that's
really the biggest purpose

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.540 align:middle line:84%
of NLP is to increase
our personal freedom.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.270 align:middle line:84%
We're all influenced all
the time by our environment,

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.480 align:middle line:84%
by the media, by television,
by the internet, by our family,

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.350 align:middle line:90%
by our personal history.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest gain
for me from learning NLP

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:84%
is being able to increase my
own ability to influence myself,

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:90%
to be more self-directed.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:30.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.422 align:middle line:84%
So now-- there's
another-- I mean,

00:39:32.422 --> 00:39:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I have many, many things
I could ask you about,

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.754 align:middle line:84%
but they're all
kind of functions

00:39:35.754 --> 00:39:38.050 align:middle line:84%
of how you work with it that
can be found in the book.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I
would like us to talk about

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.440 align:middle line:84%
before we wrap up
our conversation

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.590 align:middle line:84%
is the notion of you say
there are few questions we

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:84%
can ask ourselves
to set up our day.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Mm hmm.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.715 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And I like that.

00:39:49.715 --> 00:39:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was very
practical and uplifting.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.450 align:middle line:90%
So can you share that?

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:54.925 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Well, I
can share my list.

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And I really encourage
everybody to create their own.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But the questions I
start to set off my day

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:02.265 align:middle line:84%
are, what's something
new that I'm

00:40:02.265 --> 00:40:05.510 align:middle line:84%
going to learn today that
I'm going to really enjoy?

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And who might I meet
today that could

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
be a real source of some
information, knowledge,

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:90%
or new learning?

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And what am I going
to do for myself today

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to increase my well-being and
my value to myself and others?

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.860 align:middle line:90%
And just three questions.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so it's up to
each of us to define what those

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:26.227 align:middle line:84%
three questions are that will
propel us forward in our lives.

00:40:26.227 --> 00:40:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Absolutely.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And by
asking that out loud,

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.640 align:middle line:84%
what are you doing to yourself
by making that a habit?

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I'm directing
my attention.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: So I'm getting
up in the morning.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting dressed.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminding myself of the
three questions I've chosen.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's directing
my attention myself

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.850 align:middle line:84%
instead of just waiting
for whatever I might first

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:84%
hear on the television
or in the airport

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.670 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that
might accidentally come in

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.500 align:middle line:90%
and perturb me.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: And if I
accidentally turn on the news,

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm almost guaranteed to hear
something that'll upset me.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're setting
your own course

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.400 align:middle line:84%
by simply posing three questions
at the beginning of the day.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just directing
your attention

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and choosing to
direct it yourself.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say make
up your own questions.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
direct your attention.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: I don't want
to be responsible

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.540 align:middle line:90%
for your well-being.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I want you to.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I want everyone to be
able to be free enough

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.490 align:middle line:84%
to choose to be
responsible in a joyful way

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%
for their well-being.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.146 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So give us an idea of
what some of the advances right

00:41:25.146 --> 00:41:28.970 align:middle line:84%
now are-- we only have a
couple minutes left-- in NLP.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.262 align:middle line:84%
Is there some new science,
a new direction it's taking?

00:41:31.262 --> 00:41:33.011 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: Well, there's
a couple of things.

00:41:33.011 --> 00:41:34.680 align:middle line:84%
One is that neuroscience--
as I've said,

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I've been having a lot of
fun just pulling together

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.470 align:middle line:84%
the examples of neuroscience
validating what we've

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.080 align:middle line:84%
been teaching people
for a long time.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And the area I'm really
interested in working in next

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:90%
is in health applications.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been doing
a little bit of work

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.790 align:middle line:84%
in that area for a
long time, but there's

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.490 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot to be done with
educating our immune system,

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:55.637 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:41:55.637 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's also being validated.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.880 align:middle line:90%
It's so fascinating.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I've been promoting an allergy
process for a long time.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm right now in
the process of creating

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.020 align:middle line:84%
a new instantiation
and an advanced model.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be instantiated
as a software application

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.920 align:middle line:90%
for relieving allergic symptoms.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.184 align:middle line:84%
And we've had amazing
success with it.

00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think my new
version's going

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.740 align:middle line:90%
to be even more successful.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
interesting because just

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:84%
recently in an article in, I
believe it was the "New York

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Times," they said, well,
we're discovering now

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that cancer can really
be fought effectively

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.390 align:middle line:90%
if you train your immune system.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting here going--

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:32.698 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:32.698 --> 00:42:33.370 align:middle line:90%
You've been working on that.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTZ: --oh, no
kidding, gee, wow.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Somebody finally
got the message.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:38.435 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so NLP is a
really effective direct means

00:42:38.435 --> 00:42:40.233 align:middle line:90%
of reprogramming that, yes.

00:42:40.233 --> 00:42:40.816 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:42:40.816 --> 00:42:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's exciting.

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: It is.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I can guarantee you there
are no side effects.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: It's just not possible.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Yeah.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, Tom,
the time has zipped by.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: OK.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
so much for joining me.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Hey, it's a pleasure.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it is.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.560 align:middle line:90%
It's truly essential.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.302 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a very
user-friendly guide.

00:42:57.302 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Oh, thank you.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:58.926 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:58.926 --> 00:43:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I loved even
our little exercise

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.540 align:middle line:84%
of our Circle of
Excellence, and I

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:84%
am going to go home
and take that with me.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.169 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTZ: Terrific.

00:43:05.169 --> 00:43:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Play with it.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To take a deeper
look into NLP, Tom has written,

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.930 align:middle line:84%
as we said, this very highly
useful and approachable guide

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:84%
titled "NLP, the
Essential Guide."

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.540 align:middle line:84%
You can find the book
through any major bookseller

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.490 align:middle line:90%
or their site.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, to connect
with Tom directly

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.420 align:middle line:84%
you can go to his
website at nlpco.com.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:49.934 align:middle line:90%
