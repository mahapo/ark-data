00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY WEIDNER: Hi.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jay Weidner, guest host
for "The Healing Matrix"

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:90%
here on Gaiam TV.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Today our guest is Robert Moss.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Robert is the creator of Active
Dreaming, an original synthesis

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
of modern dreamwork
and shamanism.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
His newest book is "Dreaming
the Soul Back Home."

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Robert.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ROBERT MOSS: Good to
be dreaming with you, Jay.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Yeah, it's good to
be sitting here talking about

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:90%
things that are interesting.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.567 align:middle line:84%
This is a show on
healing, "Healing Matrix."

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: I've heard of it.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like to
talk about the healing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
nature of dreamwork
and shamanism

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on that
maybe, as opposed to some

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
of the other stuff
that you talk about.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I've made a long
study of shamanism

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.635 align:middle line:84%
since I was a young man,
read Mircea Eliade and all

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:90%
the other guys.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And it came to me
maybe in my late 30s

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
that maybe a shaman is actually
a highly psychic person.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And that they're-- when a
person comes that's maybe going

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to die, they know it, and so
they don't necessarily treat

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that person as, you know, they
treat the ones that they know

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.994 align:middle line:90%
they can heal.

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:40.326 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, you've opened
up a lot of things at once.

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:41.939 align:middle line:84%
First of all, death
can be the healer.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: And the shaman's
interest as a healer is not

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
necessarily whether you're
going to die or not but where

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
your soul is going, because your
soul is going to another world,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.935 align:middle line:84%
which the shaman knows
through direct experience.

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And your healing
journey might be

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
one that takes you beyond
the gates of death.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the universal
characteristics

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
of the shamans
that interest me is

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
that they've died and come
back, quite literally.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yes.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.863 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Another universal
characteristic not understood

00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
or talked about enough in
the neoshamanic movement

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
in the United States is
that shamans are dreamers.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
In the language of
Native Americans,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
the dominant word for
shaman in North American

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:90%
means one who dreams.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
In Mohawk, which I had to
learn because of my dreams,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:90%
it's ratetshents.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.854 align:middle line:84%
It means one who
dreams, one who can

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
travel in dreaming
for others, one

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
who can heal through
dreams, one who

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.394 align:middle line:84%
can see the future in
dreams, all of that.

00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of
the characteristics

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:90%
of the shamanic type.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.396 align:middle line:84%
The province of
the shaman is soul,

00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding
of the shamanic dreamer

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
is that souls can be
lost or disassociated

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or go missing in various
ways through what shamans

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:90%
call soul loss.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:90%
You suffer pain.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:90%
You suffer trauma.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:90%
You suffer abuse.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Part of you can't stand being
in a world that's so cruel,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:90%
so you go somewhere else.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
The job of the shaman is to
help rescue those soul parts

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:90%
and put them back in the body.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
This can be done as
a shamanic operation.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:90%
But you know what, Jay?

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I like to help people become
shamans of their own souls

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:90%
and healers of their own lives.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.444 align:middle line:84%
And if I can get them to
work with their dreams,

00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
including maybe the last dream
they remember from maybe 30

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
years ago, we have a
portal, a personal gateway

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:90%
for soul recovery.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the heart of it.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.854 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So soul loss is also an
epidemic in our society right

00:03:12.854 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:90%
now, wouldn't you say?

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: I've never met anybody
who hasn't suffered soul loss.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.287 align:middle line:84%
It's not unique
to the modern era.

00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: However, what is
probably characteristic

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
of the modern era more than
previous eras is that so many

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.735 align:middle line:84%
of us are lost to
the world of spirit,

00:03:24.735 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
lost to a means
of direct access.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:90%
People are looking.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:84%
There are all these ways and
routes that are being offered.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But as a culture,
as a society, we

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
have lost the direct connection
with the deeper world, which

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:90%
most societies have valued.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
The aboriginal understanding
in my native Australia

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
is your personal dreams can take
you into the dreamtime, which

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.465 align:middle line:84%
is not the bargain basement
of Western psychology

00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:90%
with its subconscious and so on.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:90%
The dreamtime is where it's at.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It's where you meet your
true spiritual teachers.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.280 align:middle line:84%
It's where you
remember the origin

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:90%
and purpose of human life.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
It's where you can gain
the resources for healing

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that come from having a mythic
sense of what life is all

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Your dreams can take you there.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
In our culture,
we've forgotten that.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those who's trying
to bring all of that back.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: That's incredible.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of
aboriginal culture

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:90%
and the dreamtime philosophy.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.315 align:middle line:90%
And it's incredibly fascinating.

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
They will see their child--
a couple will see their child

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.439 align:middle line:84%
together in a dream
before he's born.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.905 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And they name him, and
they talk about him as a real

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:25.405 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:27.459 align:middle line:90%
And it's really fascinating.

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:90%
I did that with my daughters.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: You did?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: When my youngest
daughter was ready to come--

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.296 align:middle line:84%
my wife was five
months pregnant--

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:36.545 align:middle line:84%
she dreamed that my daughter
appeared as a beautiful--

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
our daughter appeared as a
beautiful golden child aged

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
about two and said her name
and said, "This is my name.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Get it right."

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.640 align:middle line:90%
So we knew her gender.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.567 align:middle line:90%
We knew her name.

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:46.900 align:middle line:84%
We were absolutely poised to
welcome her into the world.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:90%
All of us can do this.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to belong to
a tribal culture to do it.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.205 align:middle line:84%
We just need to come
awake to what dreaming is

00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and how spirit communicates
through dreams.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.872 align:middle line:84%
Can I tell you a story about a
watershed in my understanding

00:04:57.872 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:84%
of these things involving
an indigenous people?

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: So 25 years ago,
I decide I'd go and live

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
on the land in this country,
where I was now living.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I bought some land
in upstate New York

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.189 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of traditional
Mohawk Indian territory.

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I bought it because of a hawk,
a red-tailed hawk that gave me

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
a sign, and a white oak
tree behind the house.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And I started dreaming
very powerfully,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:90%
the way I'd done as a boy.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And in one of my
dreams, I'm flying

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
on the wings of a
red-tailed hawk.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm lucid.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.664 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying catching a thermal.

00:05:24.664 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind the
slight discomfort

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
when the dried-up
needles of a spruce tree

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:90%
brush my wing feathers.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And I feel a pull of
someone's intention.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to go,
but I choose to go.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm now in a cabin in the
woods in a primal setting

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:90%
near Montreal maybe.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
There's this beautiful
ancient Indian woman,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Native American
woman, who's speaking

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.259 align:middle line:84%
to me in cadenced language,
like lake water lapping.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's lovely, but
I don't understand it.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not one of
those New Age dreams

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.923 align:middle line:84%
where you know
everything all at once.

00:05:50.923 --> 00:05:52.415 align:middle line:90%
This will require work.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are other signs, and
I start writing this stuff down,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:90%
and I know it's important.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I find members of the
longhouse people, the Iroquois,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:90%
the Onkwehonwe, the real people.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And they say as
they listen to me,

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:84%
repeating what I've
heard in my dreams,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
oh, Robert, you're
speaking Mohawk,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
but you're hard to
understand, not just because

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.520 align:middle line:84%
of your Anglo-Australian accent
but because you speak as Mohawk

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
might have been
spoken 300 years ago,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and there's some Huron in it.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I discover later that the
woman who had called me

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:84%
was born Huron and
adopted by the Mohawks

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and became mother of the Wolf
clan of the Mohawk Nation.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
She taught me this
about dreaming.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:90%
This is fundamental.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:90%
This is watershed.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:84%
One of these funny
words became the key.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The funny word sounds like
this, ondinnonk, ondinnonk.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It means the secret wish of
the soul especially as revealed

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:90%
in dreams.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
With that word goes
a whole practice,

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:84%
a model of understanding
for dreaming and healing.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:90%
The model is this.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Dreams show us what the
soul wants as opposed

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:90%
to what the ego wants.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
If we follow what
the soul wants,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:84%
we attract bright
energy, and we do better.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.605 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, we gradually
join the procession

00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:90%
of the walking dead.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Dreams can also
show us where soul

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:90%
has gone through soul loss.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have dreams,
that is the number one symptom

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
that you are soul gone, because
the dreamer in you is missing,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.334 align:middle line:84%
and you need help
to get it back.

00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I learned that
from the woman I've

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:90%
called in my books Island Woman.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.721 align:middle line:90%
She has historical identity.

00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I discovered that later.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm a former history professor,
and I can do research.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So that was a
watershed, understanding

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.330 align:middle line:84%
from a native tradition speaking
to me directly that dreaming

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is about soul and
very specifically

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
about identifying
what the soul wants

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and honoring that and
that decent people

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.196 align:middle line:84%
and decent culture gather
around the dreamer.

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Every morning there's
a dream, and they

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.486 align:middle line:84%
listen for what the
soul wants, and they

00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
help that person to move
in the direction of soul.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.570 align:middle line:90%
That's the heart of it.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.395 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So how does one
interpret their dreams to know?

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:48.625 align:middle line:84%
Can they self-diagnosis
themselves as their soul

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:90%
through their dreams?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: The best way to
understand a dream is to gather

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:84%
more information from the
dream, to travel back inside it,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.607 align:middle line:84%
not to sit around
discussing it as a text.

00:07:56.607 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.856 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: If you're
with a native people,

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
they won't sit around
analyzing dreams.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They will assume to begin
with that in your dreams

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
you went somewhere or you
received a visitation.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.312 align:middle line:84%
So this is bypassing the
psychological approach.

00:08:08.312 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Who were you with last night?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.899 align:middle line:84%
You're in this cabin and
such and such happened.

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Who was that?

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Was it in this world
or in the real world?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the old Iroquoian
term for the dream world.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:84%
The dream world
is the real world.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: This is the shadow
world, the surface world.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So you don't sit around
discussing it as a text.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:84%
If it's got some energy,
you start acting it out.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.930 align:middle line:90%
You do some theater.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:90%
You do some performance.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%
You bring it alive.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:90%
The tiger is in the room.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:90%
The snake is on the floor.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.757 align:middle line:90%
The bird is in the air.

00:08:30.757 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:90%
In my workshops, it's like that.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.382 align:middle line:84%
We start with theater, with
performance, with movement,

00:08:34.382 --> 00:08:36.548 align:middle line:84%
because you want the energy
from the dream, not just

00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Then when it comes to
knowing what's going on inside

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.607 align:middle line:84%
the dream, of course
you develop a practice.

00:08:41.607 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And you develop a practice
of talking about these things

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to people and
helping to give them

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:84%
feedback in a non-authoritarian,
non-controlling way.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I will never say to you, your
dream means such and such.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I will say to you, Jay,
if it were my dream

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.767 align:middle line:84%
or if it were my life,
this is what I would think.

00:08:56.767 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I would make you the
author of meaning

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
for your own dreams
and your own life.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I will not take
that away from you,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and I won't tolerate
anyone else doing that.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I won't tolerate anyone
else interpreting or telling

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.200 align:middle line:84%
people what their dreams
or their lives mean.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.616 align:middle line:84%
But you want to get to the
fundamental meaning of a dream?

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Trust your feelings.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Run a reality check.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.918 align:middle line:84%
Could any of this happen in
the waking world in the future?

00:09:13.918 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we go to the
future all the time.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Learn to do dream
reentry, which means

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:90%
traveling back inside a dream--

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I was going
to ask you about that

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.388 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: --to get
more information.

00:09:21.388 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Fascinating.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.488 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: This is a core
technique of active dreaming.

00:09:24.488 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
for shamanic types,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
the best portal for a
journey you will find

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.375 align:middle line:84%
is an authentic
spontaneous image

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:84%
that has come to you
or to someone else

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
rather than some
prefabricated structure

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
of journey exercises read
off a yellow legal pad,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:90%
as I've seen some neoshamans do.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.839 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So have an image
that is special to you?

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.225 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, we had a
wonderful 12-year-old boy

00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:90%
at a recent workshop of mine.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
He dreamed that he was
out fishing in a boat,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and a shark tugged on
the line and pulled him

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:84%
down to an underwater
civilization

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
where they had methods of
healing beyond our society.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So 35 of us all journeyed
with him inside his dream.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:90%
He went back inside his dream.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:84%
He received guidance
for the family.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:90%
He had a wonderful adventure.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.475 align:middle line:90%
We all went with him.

00:10:07.475 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
We got insights into healing,
from cellular healing

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:90%
to spiritual healing.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
We had a wonderful
adventure in a civilization

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:84%
under the sea journeying
with his spontaneous dream

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
where he's pulled by the
shark down to this realm

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:90%
beneath the waters.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an example
in relation to soul recovery.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people say to me,
I don't remember my dreams.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.085 align:middle line:84%
Our culture is
full of people who

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
are suffering a
protracted dream drought.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:90%
I know lots and lots of people.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Plenty of people have
got this organized spiritual

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:84%
They're missing
out on the movies.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.288 align:middle line:84%
They're missing
out on the theater.

00:10:35.288 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:84%
They're missing out on
the fun, the spontaneity.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.510 align:middle line:84%
They're in this
program, but they

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:90%
don't have their own stuff.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: So a woman in this
condition in France said to me

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
on the second day of a three-day
residential retreat devoted

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.907 align:middle line:84%
to "Dreaming the Soul Back
Home," she said, Robert,

00:10:48.907 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting fed up, because all
these people are talking about

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
their dreams at the
breakfast table,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:90%
and I still don't have any.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I do shamanic practice, I
do yoga, I do meditation,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
but I don't remember any
dreams from the night.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I say, I don't believe you.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:90%
She looks at me.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Tell me the last
dream you remember.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's from 30 years ago.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:90%
She's 37.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Tell me the last
dream you remember.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
She says, OK, well, a hand
reaches from behind a curtain

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
offering me chocolate,
and I like chocolate,

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
but I'm scared because
I can't see the face.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.519 align:middle line:90%
So I scream for my parents.

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And they just say,
it's just a dream.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Go back to sleep.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And I've got no help,
and I'm terrified.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.804 align:middle line:84%
Good Catholic girl, she says,
so I prayed to Jesus and Mary

00:11:27.804 --> 00:11:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and all the saints
no more dreams.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And her prayer was answered,
no dreams for 30 years.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So I say, OK, how about
going back into that dream

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.966 align:middle line:84%
from 30 years ago and find
out what's behind the curtain,

00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and find out what you can
accomplish for your own healing

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:90%
by doing that?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
She's scared, but
she's ready to do it

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.294 align:middle line:84%
if I come with her and
three other people come

00:11:45.294 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
with her as what
we call trackers.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.425 align:middle line:84%
We're going to journey together
through the doorway of a dream

00:11:49.425 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:90%
and see what we can do.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.540 align:middle line:90%
So I'm drumming.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.355 align:middle line:84%
We use drumming in my
workshops, shamanic drumming.

00:11:54.355 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:90%
She goes right there.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:90%
She opens the curtain.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.270 align:middle line:84%
She sees an angelic being, a
being of radiance and light,

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:90%
and she's thrilled.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the features resolve
into the face of her father's

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
best friend, a man who was
like a second father to him.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:90%
She loved him.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:90%
He had a toy shop.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:84%
He let her play in the
toy shop after hours.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:90%
And she says, it was you.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.276 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you show yourself?

00:12:13.276 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
He says, cheri,
you've forgotten.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I was killed in
that road accident

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:90%
three days before your dream.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.810 align:middle line:90%
My face was mutilated.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
change my appearance,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:90%
so I had to hide myself.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted you to
have something sweet.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
This moment of
revelation opened her up.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a residential workshop.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:84%
The following morning
at the breakfast table,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:90%
she is the first there.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:90%
She cannot wait for us to come.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:84%
She says, all night
long my dreams

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
are running through my mind
like a high-speed train, a Train

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Grand Vitesse,
vroom, vroom, vroom.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
She tells us eight fully formed
narrative dreams in succession

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:90%
at the breakfast table.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.654 align:middle line:90%
That is soul recovery, Jay.

00:12:45.654 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Getting the dreams back, getting
the dreamer back, getting

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:84%
the seven-year-old back was
the heart of soul recovery.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And she did it for herself
with us helping and supporting.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:90%
That's what I love to do.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: That's a
pretty amazing story.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So you had an experience
when you were really young

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.137 align:middle line:84%
in Australia, what we would
call an NDE today, I guess.

00:13:07.137 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: I don't
like the phrase much.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It's useful as a
shorthand so you

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
don't have to get in long,
complicated discussions.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But when I died for
the first time--

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I died three times as
a boy-- at age three,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
the doctors in Hogarth,
Tasmania in a bitter winter

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:84%
said to my parents,
oh, poor kid.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
He died and he came
back, didn't he?

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way I think
of it, died and came back.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember much from that
experience at three years old,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.394 align:middle line:84%
except it was very
hard after that for me

00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to stay in the
body in this world.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.537 align:middle line:84%
I was terribly sick
for eight years,

00:13:33.537 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
as if I didn't want to
be in the world, kept

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:90%
trying to check out.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.993 align:middle line:84%
I remember vividly I felt as
if I'd dropped out of the sky.

00:13:39.993 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: So this wasn't the
classic NDE where you see

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.331 align:middle line:84%
lights and you come back
feeling great and all is well.

00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
When I was nine, under emergency
surgery for an appendectomy

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.052 align:middle line:84%
in a Melbourne hospital,
I checked out of my body.

00:13:52.052 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to stay around.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I had all of those familiar
scenes of seeing the operating

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
theater, not wanting to be
there, seeing my parents,

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.800 align:middle line:84%
not wanting to watch
their grieving.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.142 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to have some fun.

00:14:00.142 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So I go out the window.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:90%
I fly around.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I go down to Luna Park, a
theme park on the beach,

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:90%
just for fun.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go on the rides.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
on the Ghost Train.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.157 align:middle line:84%
I go through the moon face,
the moon gate of Luna Park,

00:14:11.157 --> 00:14:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and something pulls
me into what seems

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:90%
to be a world inside the world.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.836 align:middle line:84%
And I live a whole
life there, it seems.

00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Grow up, become
a man, grandfather, elder.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I come out of that,
when that life is done,

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm back in the body of
the nine-year-old boy,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.258 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to be
there again because I've

00:14:26.258 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:90%
been in this beautiful scene.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.982 align:middle line:84%
So once again, it's a
sort of unresolved thing.

00:14:29.982 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a great adventure.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:90%
I remember it.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Who do I talk to about this?

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in a conservative era in
Australia in a military family.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
The doctors are
saying hallucinations

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:90%
due to medication.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:84%
It was an Aboriginal boy
who talked to me very matter

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
of factly about
this kind of thing,

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:84%
saying, for example,
oh, yeah, we do that.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:90%
We get sick.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.780 align:middle line:90%
We go and live with the spirits.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we come
back, sometimes we don't.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I talked about
dreaming of the dead.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:53.815 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we do that.

00:14:53.815 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And dream of the fu--
yeah, we do that.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
We make life or
death decisions based

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:90%
on that kind of thing, mate.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.292 align:middle line:84%
So my Aboriginal
friend was actually

00:15:00.292 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
the first person who
could validate and confirm

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:02.812 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:15:02.812 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I go around
the world today,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm very sensitive that the
primary need of so many people

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:84%
in relation to dreams, other
than getting their dreams back

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
when the dreams are
lost, is to have

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:90%
confirmation and validation.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:90%
They are not alone.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.774 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways
of working with this

00:15:17.774 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and using it to support
life and healing.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Well-- one
time in my life,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I was having a conversation
with a very, very wealthy man.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.730 align:middle line:84%
He had about $3 billion,
one of the wealthiest

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:90%
people in the world.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And he decided that he was going
to give me some good advice,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.340 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
he said this to me.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But he said to me, you're
in a dream right now.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, right now us
talking is a dream.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
between me and you

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
is that I know I'm dreaming,
and since I know I'm dreaming,

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I can create any
world I want here.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
got all my money.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and
this is all testable.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:90%
You can go test this.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Go do it.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:90%
And I never saw him again.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
It was the last conversation
I had with the guy.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But I was a young
man, and I decided

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:90%
to start testing the theory.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And so I started out small.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.912 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, I want this.

00:16:13.912 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create
this kind of reality.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:90%
And it started happening.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that you could
get caught up in this thing

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and want to be rich or have all
the sex you want or whatever,

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's probably
not a good thing.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%
But I never went that way.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I just went in small
increments of tiny things,

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.805 align:middle line:84%
like I wanted to
be a good artist

00:16:30.805 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:90%
or I wanted to be a good writer.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.284 align:middle line:84%
So I've actually come to believe
that this is a dream also,

00:16:37.284 --> 00:16:37.825 align:middle line:90%
this reality.

00:16:37.825 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What do you
think about that?

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.081 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: I think that's
absolutely correct.

00:16:41.081 --> 00:16:43.796 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can be engaged in
reality creation all the time.

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind what
your game is, as long

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:90%
as it doesn't hurt other people.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
If you want billions
of dollars, go ahead.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Make them.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.663 align:middle line:90%
Don't hurt other people, please.

00:16:49.663 --> 00:16:52.049 align:middle line:84%
Don't lay people out of work
and outsource everything

00:16:52.049 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and become Bain
Capital or something.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:84%
But I have no problem
with you making money,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
if that's your game.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not my game.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.431 align:middle line:84%
I'm not hostile to
money, but I don't

00:16:58.431 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:84%
do what I do for the money or
the fame or anything like that.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I do what I do for the
pleasure of creating.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm a writer and
artist and poet.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I do it for the joy of
seeing the light of spirit

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.832 align:middle line:84%
come back in people's
eyes when they wake up

00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and start remembering
their bigger story.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the
great pleasures.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So dreaming is very
important in terms

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
of learning to become a
creator of your own reality,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:84%
other than New Age
nostrums and affirmations.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:84%
Because in the dream worlds
change is much faster

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
than it is in the
physical world.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:84%
You enter astral planes, which
consistent of subtle matter.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:90%
There's subtle matter.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Temples, palaces, cities
exist in the imaginal realm,

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:90%
created by human imagination.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's meeting up with
larger intelligence and forces.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you operate
in those realms

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and learn to do it
consciously, you

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.080 align:middle line:84%
can see things
produced in a flash.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:84%
We spent a weekend at
a mountain gathering

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I lead creating an imaginal
city block by block,

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:90%
feature by feature.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:90%
We had great fun.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we travelled there
together after that gathering

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:84%
to places, locations
in this imaginal city.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Which Suhrawardi,
with the great insight

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.331 align:middle line:84%
of that medieval Sufi
philosopher, Suhrawardi says,

00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:90%
you know, are absolutely real.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:84%
There are temples and palaces
in the Alam al-Mithal,

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:90%
the realm of images.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
You can go there.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.250 align:middle line:90%
You can meet guides there.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.333 align:middle line:90%
You can meet other people.

00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:90%
You can rendezvous there.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So as you become a conscious
or active dreamer--

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and you understand we're talking
about much more than analyzing

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.532 align:middle line:90%
sleep dreams.

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:22.489 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
adventures in consciousness

00:18:22.489 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:84%
in the multi-dimensional
universe

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and claiming your
place at the center

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:84%
of the multi-dimensional
universe,

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
living in what Aborigines call
the all-at-once instead of just

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:84%
in linear time under the
rules of our consensual

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:90%
hallucinations.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You learn to do
this, and then you'll

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.277 align:middle line:84%
be better at playing
the game of creating

00:18:38.277 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:90%
your life in the physical world.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.318 align:middle line:84%
You'll have had more
practice, and you'll

00:18:41.318 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:90%
have seen results very quickly.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the physical
world, it takes a bit longer

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:90%
to bring things through.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Three times last
week, for example,

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I dreamed wonderful
dreams in which

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I have the completed
typescript of a book.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:84%
In one of these, it
was a whole epic poem,

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.405 align:middle line:84%
like Homer or like Apollonius
Rhodius with the "Argonautica."

00:18:58.405 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:90%
It's all done and finished.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.005 align:middle line:84%
Well, I might or might not
decide to write a whole epic

00:19:02.005 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:84%
poem, but it will take
longer than simply having

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
it available to me in
the imaginal realm.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that it's there
gives me hope and heart

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that I could bring
through something

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:90%
like that from that realm.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.749 align:middle line:84%
That's another aspect
to reality creation.

00:19:13.749 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:84%
We might be bringing
through from the realm

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:84%
of true imagination the things
we can manifest, including

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.840 align:middle line:84%
physical health,
emotional health,

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:90%
mental health in this world.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.925 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So basically we are
multi-dimensional creatures.

00:19:25.925 --> 00:19:27.257 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:19:27.257 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And dreams release
us from the three-dimensional

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.197 align:middle line:90%
realities into higher realms.

00:19:32.197 --> 00:19:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yeah.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:84%
For everyday purposes,
dreams-- and I'm

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:84%
now talking about
sleep dreams primarily,

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:84%
including the ones we
don't want and certainly

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't ask for-- they are
our common inheritance.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
They are something that is
available to every human being.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Whether we remember
or not, it's there.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I will extend that description
to those experiences

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:90%
between sleep and awake.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
As Tinkerbell said to
Peter Pan, look for me

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:84%
in the place between sleep and
awake, the hypnogogic zone,

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
the liminal zone,
the borderland.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.796 align:middle line:90%
That is a fantastic--

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: It really is.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.086 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: --sandlot for lucid
dreaming, conscious dreaming,

00:20:04.086 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:90%
adventures in imagination.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have direct
access to the sacred.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
We have direct access to
the other orders of reality.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:84%
We have a way of understanding
parallel universes

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and the behavior of
our parallel self

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.857 align:middle line:84%
right now in the
universe next to us,

00:20:17.857 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
where you and I are now sitting
here having this conversation,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and more interesting
parallel selves

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.950 align:middle line:84%
from whom we can bring
gifts and skills and lessons

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:90%
into our present life.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:90%
We can do that.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Physicists speculate about many
worlds, parallel universes.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.429 align:middle line:84%
Dreamers can go
there consciously.

00:20:32.429 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We are time travellers
in dreams too.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We can go to the
past or the future.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, dreaming
is an absolute survival tool.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.371 align:middle line:84%
I ask of any dream, where
did I go last night?

00:20:41.371 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And if it seems to be the
future, which it often

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:84%
is-- dreams are often
memories of the future--

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.850 align:middle line:90%
do I like that future or not?

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
If I don't like it, can I
do something to change it?

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.875 align:middle line:84%
If I do like it, what action
will I take to manifest

00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that event I would
like to see come about?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is available
to everybody.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah, it is.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And you remind me of a story I
heard Ray Bradbury tell once.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
They asked him what his
writing habits were.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, as soon as
I'm in the hypnogogic state

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, I roll out
of bed and start writing.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And so he writes for the
first hour of the day,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.455 align:middle line:84%
and that was it, completely
no coffee, nothing.

00:21:17.455 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
He made sure he
stayed as much as he

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
could in the hypnogogic
place as long as he could.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he said he
produced his best stories.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.294 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: That's beautiful.

00:21:26.294 --> 00:21:28.543 align:middle line:84%
I did that yesterday morning
before flying to Boulder.

00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I was on a 6:00 AM flight.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I got up a 3 o'clock.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have
coffee or anything.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:90%
I just sat down.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I wrote 3,000 words before I
left for the airport at 5:30

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:90%
without thinking about it.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.514 align:middle line:84%
And that's more than my
average daily production.

00:21:40.514 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I can go many days
without writing

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.520 align:middle line:90%
anything of that kind at all.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.839 align:middle line:84%
But Ray Bradbury was
absolutely right.

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And also I like this
idea of seeing futures,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:84%
parallel futures, possible
futures and then actually

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
reentering back into that and
reconstructing your own future.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.895 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Shall I give you an
example of exactly how it is

00:22:04.895 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
possible and how exactly
to work with these things?

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Please.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.796 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: We develop our own
styles of dreaming and our own

00:22:09.796 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:84%
markers for what's
going in dreams.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Practice, practice, practice.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
As with anything else,
this is a practice.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Like yoga, astronomy,
or anything else,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.236 align:middle line:84%
you get really good at
it by doing a lot of it.

00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So here's a dream
of my own which

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
saved my life involving
a possible future.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:84%
In the dream, I'm
driving east on a road

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I know in upstate New York.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:90%
I come to a fork in the road.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:84%
There's the convenience
store across the way.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And everything comes to a stop.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
The sky becomes very
strange, very beautiful.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a purple
bruise in a yellow sky.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm in black and
white, and then I'm in color.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's surreal.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.143 align:middle line:90%
Then it's black and white.

00:22:42.143 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
before I come out

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
of the dream I'm
in bardo states.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm in afterlife states.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:90%
This is for real.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
If I don't want to
die on this road--

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:84%
this is my own understanding
of my own style of dreaming--

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:84%
I better remember exactly
where the action stopped,

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:84%
identify the place,
that fork in that road.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, I'm driving
up that hill towards that fork.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a UPS truck
parked on a double yellow

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:84%
to my right blocking the
view of the road ahead.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Normally, I'd pull
out, like any motorist.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it's where the action
stopped in the dream, I stop.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I missed the head-on
collision of the 18-wheeler

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.270 align:middle line:84%
coming down the hill
at 60 miles a hour

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.654 align:middle line:84%
in a 30 mile per hour
zone because I remembered

00:23:18.654 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
that was where the
action stopped.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was catapulted
unwillingly and unprepared

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.620 align:middle line:90%
into an afterlife I didn't want.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
dream saved my life.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:90%
So it's like this, I think, Jay.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Any future we see is
a possible future.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The odds on it
manifesting can be

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.372 align:middle line:84%
changed if we have
some flexibility.

00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And even if we cannot change
the future because it's a mass

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.496 align:middle line:84%
event or we have no
means of changing it

00:23:38.496 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:84%
or because our body's about to
give up or someone else's is,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.380 align:middle line:84%
the dream prepares us for those
events so we can work around

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Even if we can't change
the event itself,

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.230 align:middle line:90%
we can change our attitude.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:84%
We can be prepared
for that event.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:84%
We can avoid that date
with a mass disaster,

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
This is, by the way,
one of the reasons why

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
all human societies that I know
about, up until modern era,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.100 align:middle line:84%
have valued dreams
and dreamers highly.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:84%
They've understood that we
see the future in dreams,

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:84%
not only for ourselves
and our families

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.190 align:middle line:84%
but for communities
and the whole world.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It's part of our
human survival kit.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And we've got all these analysts
and all this technology.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But my goodness,
we're missing out

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.355 align:middle line:84%
on one of the most
valuable resources

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:90%
for scouting the future.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Absolutely.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: You can save your
life and save your health.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:20.521 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Absolutely.

00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, like
you said before, it's

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
why we're here, because our
ancestors dreamed and saved

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:90%
their lives.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Exactly.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I was on British
radio, unfortunately,

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
about two months ago with
a bunch of scientists.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
debunk me, I guess.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And I had to resort
finally to the fact

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.704 align:middle line:84%
that Francis Crick
discovered the shape of DNA

00:24:44.704 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:90%
through a dream.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:45.911 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:24:45.911 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: And Einstein also said
that his theory of revelation

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
came from a dream of seeing
a street light and the mist

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.000 align:middle line:84%
around the street light and
seeing the light reflecting

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
from the streetlight and
realizing that light travelled

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and that he began constructing
the theory of relativity,

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.214 align:middle line:90%
which began with a dream.

00:25:03.214 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Francis
Crick, of course,

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.463 align:middle line:84%
became a skeptic about
many aspects of this,

00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:84%
but you're quite right about
the dream discovery of DNA.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Another of my books, "The
Secret History of Dreaming,"

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
has really a major
chapter on dreaming

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
in the history of science and
how scientific breakthroughs

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:84%
have come through from
dreams, but more particularly

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
from that hypnogogic state,
that in between state

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:84%
when creativity
is running strong.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Kekule discovering the
nature of the benzene

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:84%
ring when he's dozing by a
fire, dormant between sleep

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and awake, and sees a
serpent biting its tail

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly understands.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.720 align:middle line:84%
There are so many examples like
this in the history of science.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So when scientists are
skeptical about this,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.260 align:middle line:84%
they're forgetting the history
of the greatest breakthroughs

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:90%
in their own field.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, the people
the British call the talking

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
classes-- academia, scientists,
and the mainstream media--

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.990 align:middle line:84%
are the most hard-headed
people when it comes to--

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: They certainly are.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.338 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: --all of this.

00:25:51.338 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Ordinary people get it.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I find whatever
their job, whatever--

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.559 align:middle line:84%
ordinary people get
this very quickly.

00:25:57.559 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:90%
And they're hungry for it, Jay.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: You're absolutely right.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.485 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: They want
guidance and confirmation,

00:26:01.485 --> 00:26:03.982 align:middle line:84%
and they want tools that they
can use on a daily basis.

00:26:03.982 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:84%
You learn this, you learn
this active dreaming,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
you can be a shaman
of the breakfast table

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:90%
wherever you are.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you are,
your day starts

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.029 align:middle line:90%
with some real work of healing.

00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
academia is I can almost

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
tell what kind of
degree someone has

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
within seconds of talking to
them, because there's this,

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, a certain
arrogance about them.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
They understand reality,
and the rest of us don't.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, one of the things
that Ken Wilber in particular

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.279 align:middle line:84%
schooled me to understand when
I read one of his early books

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:84%
"Eye to Eye" is that real
science is state-specific.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.364 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
understand a field,

00:26:42.364 --> 00:26:43.780 align:middle line:84%
you must have the
means of knowing

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.094 align:middle line:90%
appropriate to that field.

00:26:45.094 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:84%
For this field, there's no way
of understanding this field

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:84%
unless you can enter and
travel in the dream space,

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
in other words a
non-ordinary reality,

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:84%
in other words in
the astral realms.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Unless you go there, unless you
learn techniques like shared

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.626 align:middle line:84%
dreaming, mutual dreaming,
dreaming with other people,

00:26:59.626 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:90%
you don't know.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a science.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
You have a science of
the brain, perhaps,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.441 align:middle line:84%
but the brain can never explain
the mind because the brain is

00:27:05.441 --> 00:27:07.285 align:middle line:84%
inside the mind, not
the other way around.

00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So although it's great
to have all this stuff

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that neuroscience is giving
us, and we can use it,

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and we can use it for
healing our bodies,

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
it will no more help you to
understand the larger reality

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.857 align:middle line:84%
than pulling apart a TV monitor
in hopes of understanding

00:27:19.857 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:90%
where the signal is coming from.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.610 align:middle line:84%
You won't find it
in the TV monitor.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:90%
You won't find it in the brain.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.675 align:middle line:84%
We want to know these
things about the brain.

00:27:25.675 --> 00:27:27.986 align:middle line:84%
It's great to know just
how wonderful the brain is.

00:27:27.986 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But we'll never find
what we're looking

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:84%
for in terms of the origins
and nature of consciousness

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
or the nature of the
multi-dimensional universe

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
or the nature of dreaming by
just picking apart the brain

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.652 align:middle line:84%
and looking at chemical flushing
and random neural firing

00:27:40.652 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:90%
during the night.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.350 align:middle line:90%
We'll never get it that way.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.015 align:middle line:84%
The brain is really more
like an antenna for a flow

00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:46.727 align:middle line:90%
or the Tao of reality.

00:27:46.727 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yeah.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And if the antenna
isn't working very well,

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.409 align:middle line:84%
then, of course, our images
will be jumbled and vague.

00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:53.592 align:middle line:84%
So that's important to know
in relation to dreaming.

00:27:53.592 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:90%
There are trash dreams.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Not all dreams are important.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.085 align:middle line:84%
In Hawaii, which has a rich
vocabulary of dreaming--

00:27:59.085 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yes, it does.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: --they have a word
for trash dreams which I love,

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:90%
wild goatfish dreams.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.510 align:middle line:90%
They eat goatfish.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.699 align:middle line:84%
You eat wild goatfish
in the wrong season,

00:28:07.699 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and it produces a
dream that's really

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.164 align:middle line:84%
the result of what you
put into your belly.

00:28:11.164 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:90%
So you throw that out.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a trash dream.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.720 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you could
have a straight-up dream.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's not about
a shot of alcohol.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.471 align:middle line:84%
A straight-up dream
is something that

00:28:18.471 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
doesn't require interpretation
because it's absolutely clear,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.830 align:middle line:84%
often showing the future
or something at a distance.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Dreaming peoples have
a vocabulary like that.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:84%
My Scottish ancestors had a word
for a certain kind of dreamer.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.805 align:middle line:84%
The word sounds like
something you cook up

00:28:31.805 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:90%
in a sheep's stomach.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Bruadaraiche is the
closest I can come.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It actually mean
something like someone

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
who dreams the past
and the future,

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
someone who is a time
traveller in dreams.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.328 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you start
picking these words apart

00:28:43.328 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that ancient and indigenous
cultures understand right

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
inside the language what the
nature in many modalities

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of dreaming is in a way that our
modern vocabulary and certainly

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.470 align:middle line:84%
the language of
Western psychology

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:84%
doesn't equip us to understand
or describe at all well.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What do you think about
movies and television shows?

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Are these affecting or
atrophying our dream state?

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Are they helping it?

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Because they're like dreams.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Movies are like dreams.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
a reconstructed dream,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:90%
a good movie especially.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering
if that is having

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.940 align:middle line:84%
maybe a deleterious
effect on us.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: I don't know to what
extent movies are having that

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.989 align:middle line:84%
I think some people
program what they're

00:29:27.989 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
going to do during the night
based upon what they watch

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
on TV, although TV, as Marshall
McLuhan said with prescience,

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
is a cool medium, not
in the sense of great.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a cool medium because
it doesn't mobilize people,

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:84%
unlike radio, which is a
hot medium in his parlance.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that TV
really pushes people,

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.632 align:middle line:84%
pushes their buttons
all that much

00:29:47.632 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:84%
either way in
relation to dreaming.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.827 align:middle line:84%
The depiction of
dreaming in movies

00:29:50.827 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and TV is sometimes
interesting and sometimes not.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:84%
"Medium" the TV
show, for example,

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.220 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of psychic activity
based on dreams, some of which

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is quite plausible
and well done.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.700 align:middle line:84%
I can think of movies in which--
I can think of the Bruce Willis

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:84%
movie where somebody's
trying to get

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:84%
in touch with his departed
wife and a dead boy

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.249 align:middle line:84%
says to him find
her in your dreams.

00:30:08.249 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.706 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: So there have
been moments like that.

00:30:10.706 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that virtual reality
games, internet games,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.070 align:middle line:84%
this kind of thing are
probably taking us deeper

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.340 align:middle line:84%
into an artificial
version of the dreaming.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are opportunities
and great risks in that.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:84%
They have a word in Urdu-- I
get around-- which is tilism.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.564 align:middle line:84%
Tilism is an artificial
reality, maybe a whole universe.

00:30:29.564 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It's related to
the word talisman.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.150 align:middle line:84%
A tilism is a realm
of enchantment

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.114 align:middle line:84%
where you get imprisoned
and you can't get out.

00:30:36.114 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Think of "The Matrix."

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.820 align:middle line:84%
You're in a realm that
is an artificial realm.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
It is possible that we
are setting ourselves up

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.480 align:middle line:84%
for more and more of this,
particularly our young people,

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to have their heads inside
an artificial reality,

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:84%
unlike the real
world of dreaming.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And this could go in all
sorts of unwanted directions.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a bit
concerned about that.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm a bit concerned about how
our technology could equip us

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to have 100 orgasms
in a virtual reality

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
all the time, losing
us to anything of value

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.950 align:middle line:84%
in the real world either in this
universe or in other universes.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I worry about
that, too, actually.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.877 align:middle line:90%
What about drugs?

00:31:12.877 --> 00:31:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: What about drugs?

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Behavior
modification drugs,

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.282 align:middle line:84%
SSRIs that they're giving
out all over the place now.

00:31:19.282 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Does that affect
your dream states?

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.619 align:middle line:84%
I think we're a
pill-pushing society.

00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:90%
We're a doped up culture.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.610 align:middle line:84%
People take dope for
everything for pain,

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.391 align:middle line:84%
for alteration for
functioning, et cetera.

00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:30.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
medications interfere

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.860 align:middle line:90%
with spontaneous dreaming.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.511 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't counsel
anybody to go off their meds

00:31:35.511 --> 00:31:37.510 align:middle line:84%
because they notice it's
affecting the dreaming.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:84%
They might need the
meds for other reasons.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not equipped
to advise on that.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.041 align:middle line:84%
But I think that a lot of the
meds that are being handed out,

00:31:43.041 --> 00:31:45.996 align:middle line:84%
particularly antidepressants and
sleeping pills-- some sleeping

00:31:45.996 --> 00:31:47.370 align:middle line:84%
pills actually
advertise, there's

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:84%
one that used to advertise the
idea that you wouldn't have

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.795 align:middle line:84%
any dreams if you took this
sleeping pill, no more dreams.

00:31:51.795 --> 00:31:52.795 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Oh, what a drag.

00:31:52.795 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Oh, my goodness.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.441 align:middle line:84%
Talk about missing
the movies cosmically.

00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yep.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: And I will be
approached by people

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:84%
who've suffered serious
depression or bipolar disorder

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.149 align:middle line:84%
or what is diagnosed
as sleep disorders.

00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:04.440 align:middle line:90%
They say, can I go off my meds?

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.460 align:middle line:90%
I say, I can't discuss it.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Go and talk to your doctor.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: But it does interfere.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.434 align:middle line:84%
I'd noticed this as
a historian as well.

00:32:11.434 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:84%
My first job was a
lecturer in ancient history

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.660 align:middle line:90%
in my native Australia.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
When I survey the history
of sleep and dreams

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.770 align:middle line:84%
cross-culturally from as
far back as we can trace,

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.870 align:middle line:84%
most people never
expected to sleep

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
the way we expect
ourselves to sleep today.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.690 align:middle line:84%
They did not expect
to lie down and sleep

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
like the dead for six,
seven, eight hours.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: That's right.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.258 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: They expected to have
at least two distinct phases

00:32:30.258 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:90%
of sleep with time in between.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:84%
They were biphasic or
polyphasic sleepers.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It's only in the last 150 years
in the west, post-Industrial

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Revolution, we've got into
this habit of thinking,

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, you lie down, you go to
sleep, you get up, that's that.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
What happens in between
is not important.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.459 align:middle line:84%
In cultures which have the
different mode of sleep,

00:32:49.459 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
the relationship with dreams
is likely to be different.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.417 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have that
interregnum, that interval,

00:32:54.417 --> 00:32:55.750 align:middle line:90%
it's a chance to pull things up.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a chance to spend time
in that hypnogogic border

00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:59.130 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a chance to share
things with someone

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.060 align:middle line:84%
who is sharing your bed
or sharing your community

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:84%
or your big house in
an indigenous culture.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think that our whole
relationship with sleep

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:84%
is, in terms of human
evolution, strange

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:90%
and possibly undesirable.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.792 align:middle line:84%
I'm a biphasic or
polyphasic sleeper.

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:16.374 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Well, tell
us what that means.

00:33:16.374 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Biphasic means that you
sleep in two distinct periods

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.370 align:middle line:84%
of sleep, like say three
hours or four hours a night,

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.040 align:middle line:84%
if you need them, then
maybe a two-hour nap.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.435 align:middle line:84%
That would be an example
in modern culture.

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Oh, really?

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: And that's the way
I like to live when I can.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:84%
When I'm traveling, I tend
not to be a biphasic sleeper,

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:30.758 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have
time to get the nap.

00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So I typically sleep for
no more than three hours

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.581 align:middle line:90%
or so at a time.

00:33:34.581 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm usually refreshed
because I have

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
such interesting experiences
through the nights.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Polyphasic would mean that
you need more than two bursts

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.290 align:middle line:84%
of sleep or downtime in
the course of the day.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And hey, as technology
makes it possible

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.750 align:middle line:84%
for us to work away
from the office,

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:84%
why shouldn't we
live more like that?

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And I think of Thomas Edison.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't know very
much about his dreams,

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.120 align:middle line:84%
except that he realized
a huge life dream.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But we know that Thomas
Edison advised all his people

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.730 align:middle line:84%
if they wanted to be creative
to disregard the clock.

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:84%
If you want breakfast at
midnight or if you want

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.275 align:middle line:90%
champagne at breakfast, have it.

00:34:05.275 --> 00:34:06.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
sleep at 3 o'clock

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon or 10
o'clock in the morning,

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.590 align:middle line:90%
do it, as long as you produce.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.131 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Because he'd sleep
under his desk.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Yeah, he'd
sleep under his desk.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:90%
He'd sleep in the workplace.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:14.719 align:middle line:90%
He'd be available at any time.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
The day would sometimes
start at midnight.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: I like that too.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: I like
that mode of living.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: I do too.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: And he was probably
in a somewhat hypnogogic state

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:22.340 align:middle line:90%
much of the time.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I was just
going to say--

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: So he may not be a guy
who reported a lot of dreams,

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.320 align:middle line:84%
but he's in that liminal
state much of the time,

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:90%
as creative people often are.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed when I do
cat naps in the afternoon

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.830 align:middle line:84%
that the hypnogogic state is
increased for some reason.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yeah.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.179 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: It's like
a two-hour nap,

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll wake in an ultra hypnogogic
state that I don't usually wake

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.834 align:middle line:90%
up to in the morning.

00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: And then the other
thing is healing's about

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.790 align:middle line:90%
wholeness, right?

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.623 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting in
touch with everything,

00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:54.865 align:middle line:84%
being more of ourselves,
restoring our lost relationship

00:34:54.865 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
with nature and the animals
and the birds and the winds

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.580 align:middle line:90%
and the mountain and the forest.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That involves being
a wakeful dreamer

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.184 align:middle line:84%
as you go around
in everyday life.

00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:84%
It involves being alert to
the play of synchronicity

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
or coincidence at every
turning, noticing mythic themes,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:84%
developing what Baudelaire
with a poet's clarity

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.489 align:middle line:84%
called a state of poetic
health, which means you

00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:90%
notice rhymes and resemblances.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And today, for example,
I arrive in Boulder.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.745 align:middle line:84%
I have a day of really mythic,
wonderful synchronicity.

00:35:20.745 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I arrive at the
Boulder bookstore

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to talk about my new
poetry collection.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm greeted at the desk by a
woman whose name is Athena.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So I say, quick as a
whip, where's Odysseus?

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And they say, we have
Odysseus in the store.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.020 align:middle line:90%
We'll call him.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And they call a young man who
works for the book shop called

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.036 align:middle line:90%
Odysseus, no kidding.

00:35:37.036 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I say, where'd
you get that name?

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:39.701 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my parents lived in Greece.

00:35:39.701 --> 00:35:40.457 align:middle line:90%
It's my name.

00:35:40.457 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So I have myself
photographed with Odysseus.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I then walk into
Gaiam this morning.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I am greeted by a
woman who gives me

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:84%
a cup of espresso
whose name is Gaia

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and shows me the tattoo
of Gaia on her upper arm.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I walk into the
studio, and I have

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.380 align:middle line:84%
a guy whose middle
name is Icarus.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So you know this is
not just coincidence.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:84%
In a word that I invented,
it's reincidence, incidents

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.430 align:middle line:84%
of cases of meaningful
coincidence coming up again

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:04.430 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:05.739 align:middle line:90%
Why is that so relevant to me?

00:36:05.739 --> 00:36:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Because I love the Greek myths.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I've been immersed in
them again recently.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:10.155 align:middle line:90%
I've been dreaming of them.

00:36:10.155 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I've been back in the world
of Odysseus and the Argonauts

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.290 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And I come to Boulder,
and I'm surrounded

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:84%
by characters whose
names are right

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.850 align:middle line:84%
out of the central casting
for the Greek epic myths.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Well, that's
a very Boulder story.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really interested
in synchronicity.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:27.560 align:middle line:84%
It's one of my
favorite subjects.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And I have an
astonishing catalog

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:33.890 align:middle line:84%
of coincidences and
synchronicities in my life,

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:84%
of which I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for me following

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.460 align:middle line:84%
those synchronicities and
realizing that something

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.119 align:middle line:84%
important just happened, a
tear in the matrix or whatever.

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So what
is synchronicity?

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, synchronicity
is a word invented by Mr. Jung,

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.253 align:middle line:84%
who was a classical scholar
as well as everything else--

00:36:50.253 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: And a dream--

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: A guy who was guided by
dreams and synchronicity every

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.226 align:middle line:90%
day of his life, as I am.

00:36:56.226 --> 00:36:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I live like Jung
in that respect.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.099 align:middle line:84%
I don't do anything important
without being guided by dreams

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:02.346 align:middle line:84%
or synchronicity,
those steer me in ways

00:37:02.346 --> 00:37:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that I might have
expected, and I

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:84%
follow those prompts,
just as Jung did.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So synchronicity literally
means things coming together

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.640 align:middle line:90%
at a given moment in time.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really
a satisfactory term,

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.895 align:middle line:84%
because it implies these things
are happening at the same time.

00:37:14.895 --> 00:37:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Wolfgang Pauli, the
quantum physicist

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.199 align:middle line:84%
who dialogued with
Jung about all of this

00:37:18.199 --> 00:37:20.031 align:middle line:84%
as Jung was developing
synchronicity theory,

00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:21.650 align:middle line:90%
said, this word won't do at all.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Call it isomorphy.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Isomorphy means identity
or similarity of forms.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a better term.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:27.943 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: It is.

00:37:27.943 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: I've just invented
recently the term reincidence

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.950 align:middle line:84%
for things that
repeat over time.

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:84%
What is it in general,
synchronicity or meaningful

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:90%
coincidence?

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
It's when your inner
sense of meaning

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.651 align:middle line:84%
meets an external
event that matches

00:37:40.651 --> 00:37:42.150 align:middle line:84%
your inner sense
of meaning, and you

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.480 align:middle line:84%
feel that the universe
has spoken to you.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: That is a
great description.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: There's something
very personal about it.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.740 align:middle line:90%
People struggle to explain it.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:84%
They get tongue-tied
or tongue-twisted.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.229 align:middle line:90%
But it feels personal.

00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:84%
It's when the universe
gets personal,

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.410 align:middle line:84%
you feel you're being patted
on the shoulder or something's

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.819 align:middle line:84%
mussing your hair or
something is pushing you back.

00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:01.235 align:middle line:84%
It could be negative
runs as well.

00:38:01.235 --> 00:38:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: It can be.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Absolutely.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:06.440 align:middle line:84%
But you know that the powers of
the deeper world are at play.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Dreams in relation
to coincidence,

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I think it's like this.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:84%
When we go dreaming in the
big dreams, we go traveling.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.280 align:middle line:84%
We travel through
the curtain walls

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of our ordinary understanding,
our ordinary reality.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.010 align:middle line:90%
We get out there.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.130 align:middle line:90%
We might do it the shaman's way.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.171 align:middle line:90%
We might do it the night.

00:38:18.171 --> 00:38:20.120 align:middle line:84%
We might do it by
some other technique.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Through coincidence, the
powers behind the curtain walls

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
come through to play with
us and manifest in our lives

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and show us something
of the deeper state.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.240 align:middle line:90%
I think that's how it is.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So working with
dreams and coincidence

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:38.960 align:middle line:84%
are the two halves of a
life plan, certainly for me.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can learn to do this.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And for many people
who are still

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.220 align:middle line:84%
struggling to remember
dreams, playing a game

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.870 align:middle line:84%
like the first vanity
plate of the day

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.036 align:middle line:84%
is going to give you a
message or the first bird you

00:38:49.036 --> 00:38:51.835 align:middle line:84%
see is going to suggest
something or the book you open

00:38:51.835 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:84%
will show you something in
the passage you open to,

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:90%
that works for them.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.240 align:middle line:90%
They can do that right away.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're often
stunned by how quickly

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.639 align:middle line:90%
the messages start multiplying.

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:84%
A few weeks ago, I was reading
a book before I went to bed.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It was on Egypt, and I
was reading about Horus.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I have an ash tree right
outside my bedroom window.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in the
morning, usual time,

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.460 align:middle line:90%
and I opened up the curtain.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge hawk
sitting on the branch.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And Horus is a hawk.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So I wake my wife
up, all excited

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that Horus is
outside the window.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was a synchronicity.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.649 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I have no idea what it
meant, but it was beautiful.

00:39:34.649 --> 00:39:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: It is beautiful.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's about more than
getting individual messages.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
important thing to note.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.601 align:middle line:90%
It's about pattern recognition.

00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It's about developing a
consciousness of the field.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about noting,
as the Chinese say,

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that there are things that
like to happen together.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.650 align:middle line:90%
It's reading patterns.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not just getting a sign.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:84%
See, a sign is less
interesting than the symbol.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.070 align:middle line:84%
A sign is like an
arrow that says

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:90%
go left or go right or stop.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.500 align:middle line:84%
There are synchronicities
that are like signs,

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:90%
stop, go, go left, go right.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.981 align:middle line:84%
A symbol is what brings together
something that we know or think

00:40:04.981 --> 00:40:07.230 align:middle line:84%
we know with something we
do not yet know and takes us

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.140 align:middle line:90%
into a deeper reality.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: It's a congealing thing.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.831 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:40:09.831 --> 00:40:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So Baudelaire, again,
says with poetic clarity,

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.000 align:middle line:84%
you are walking in a forest
of living symbols that

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.970 align:middle line:84%
are looking at you,
"Correspondence," the poem.

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:19.864 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Nice.

00:40:19.864 --> 00:40:21.405 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: That's how
I live every day.

00:40:21.405 --> 00:40:24.287 align:middle line:84%
There's a chapter which borrows
from that title in the book

00:40:24.287 --> 00:40:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing at the moment
about living by synchronicity.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.495 align:middle line:84%
The hawk, let me tell
you a quick hawk story.

00:40:28.495 --> 00:40:30.510 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
watershed in my life.

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that I moved to
upstate New York to a farm

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.260 align:middle line:84%
with 60 acres of
woodland that never

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.422 align:middle line:90%
heard the sound of an ax--

00:40:36.422 --> 00:40:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: How nice.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.338 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: --because of a hawk.

00:40:38.338 --> 00:40:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking, OK,
I want to live here.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.338 align:middle line:90%
I had some money at the time.

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to buy this place.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:43.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting under a white oak.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, if it's
right, there'll be a sign.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.076 align:middle line:84%
I know no one in this
part of the world.

00:40:47.076 --> 00:40:49.430 align:middle line:84%
A red-tailed hawk
circles lower and lower,

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.190 align:middle line:84%
squalling at me in
a language I feel

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I ought to be able to
understand, and drops a feather

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.500 align:middle line:90%
between my legs.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So that was a clincher,
the unsecret wing

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.530 align:middle line:90%
brush from the universe.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.105 align:middle line:84%
When it was time
to leave that farm

00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and come back into community
and teach the things I was now

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.060 align:middle line:84%
teaching, I go back into
the house for the third time

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.340 align:middle line:90%
after we've closed it up.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.151 align:middle line:90%
It's broom clean.

00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:11.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason to
go back in the house,

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.860 align:middle line:90%
but I have to go back.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.855 align:middle line:84%
And I hear a rustling
from the big family

00:41:14.855 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:90%
room we'd added at the back.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And I go to the fireplace,
and behind the fire screen

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.910 align:middle line:84%
there was a fledgling red-tailed
hawk, a very young one

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that'd somehow come
down the chimney.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So my last action on the land
I bought because of the hawk

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:30.180 align:middle line:84%
is to carry the young
hawk out next to my heart.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And I release it, and it flies
straight into the branches

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.110 align:middle line:84%
of the white oak tree where the
first hawk gave me the sign.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:37.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, Jay, you
live long enough,

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:84%
you notice these loops,
these recurrences,

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:40.750 align:middle line:90%
these eternal returns.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yes.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.350 align:middle line:90%
That's a great story.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.520 align:middle line:90%
I love that stuff.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So synchronicity is,
in a way-- I once

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.790 align:middle line:84%
had a very wise man that
I knew, and I went to him

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and I said, how come
there's no masters anymore

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.290 align:middle line:84%
that I can go study,
highly educated

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:04.160 align:middle line:90%
ascended, even, masters?

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.250 align:middle line:90%
And he laughed at me.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.590 align:middle line:90%
He was much older than me.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, they're gone.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of gone.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.390 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, what can I do?

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in this
world synchronicity

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.360 align:middle line:90%
becomes the teacher.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.747 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what synchronicity
and coincidence was,

00:42:17.747 --> 00:42:19.330 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't understand
what he meant.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that
I was not awake

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.020 align:middle line:84%
to the synchronicities
that were occurring to me.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So I made a conscious effort
to become awake to them.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And I see synchronicities
and coincidences

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.070 align:middle line:90%
happening to other people.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And I see they're
asleep to them.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering what
we can do to wake people

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.090 align:middle line:84%
up to start noticing that the
universe is trying to tell you

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.810 align:middle line:84%
something when you
have a synchronicity.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.009 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, I don't
regard myself as a preacher.

00:42:48.009 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm passionate about what I do.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
it's necessary for me

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to go around saying to
people, wake up, wake up.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Although that's what the angel
always says in the scriptures.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:90%
The angel turns up.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.060 align:middle line:90%
It's usually not cute.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The first words from the angelic
being are things like wake

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.590 align:middle line:84%
up, get up, get off your
bed, get on with it, wake up,

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.140 align:middle line:90%
wake up.

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.830 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt the word for
dream means awakening.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.140 align:middle line:90%
We transliterate it as rswt.

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.609 align:middle line:90%
It means an awakening.

00:43:12.609 --> 00:43:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very interested
in waking people up,

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.691 align:middle line:84%
but I don't feel I have to
go around and shout at them.

00:43:16.691 --> 00:43:19.844 align:middle line:84%
I feel that my role,
other than to teach

00:43:19.844 --> 00:43:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the thousands of people I
teach through my workshops

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and the many thousands more
I teach through my books,

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.850 align:middle line:84%
is to confirm and
consolidate people's growing

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:29.300 align:middle line:84%
understanding when
they begin to wake up.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.610 align:middle line:90%
You see, that's what we need.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.170 align:middle line:90%
You begin to wake up.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:34.950 align:middle line:84%
You need someone to confirm
and validate what's going on.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.910 align:middle line:84%
When I moved to my
previous home in Troy,

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:40.580 align:middle line:84%
New York-- there's that
classic reference again--

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.912 align:middle line:84%
I dreamed of a dead psychic
I never met who said,

00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Troy will be very
important in your life.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.161 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up thinking, oh, yes,
of course Troy is important,

00:43:47.161 --> 00:43:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Troy, "The Iliad,"
Achilles, the gods, yes.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.204 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Troy, New
York after that dream.

00:43:53.204 --> 00:43:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd just arrived
and putting books

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:90%
on the bookcase in my study.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.596 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly a huge man,
even by my standards,

00:43:57.596 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is at the door,
banging on the door.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And I open the door,
somewhat startled.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm your neighbor.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I've just come
from the graveyard.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.270 align:middle line:90%
I smelled beer on his breath.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.985 align:middle line:90%
He's an Irish American.

00:44:04.985 --> 00:44:07.110 align:middle line:84%
He's got beer on his breath
at 8:00 in the morning.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:07.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Just come from the
graveyard, Jimmy?

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.640 align:middle line:90%
My dad came by last night.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.362 align:middle line:84%
Had to go make sure he's
still in the ground, he said.

00:44:14.362 --> 00:44:15.820 align:middle line:84%
His dad had visited
him, but he had

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.150 align:middle line:84%
no model of understanding
that interaction

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:19.880 align:middle line:84%
with the dead, the
deceased is possible

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.110 align:middle line:90%
because they're still alive.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:24.245 align:middle line:84%
So my first job that morning
was to calm him down and explain

00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to him exactly why
his dad might have

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:28.260 align:middle line:84%
come visiting, why
it's a real experience,

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.270 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a dream or
hypnogogic or a vision

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.240 align:middle line:84%
or a visitation, and
how to work with it.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.320 align:middle line:90%
I got him calmed down.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I got him to follow
a simple ritual, when

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:38.344 align:middle line:84%
he was calm enough, to initiate
a conversation with his father

00:44:38.344 --> 00:44:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and start bringing through
all the forgiveness

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and healing that
is available there.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.094 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the huge
areas of healing, healing

00:44:44.094 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:84%
with our ancestors,
healing with our departed,

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.093 align:middle line:90%
healing with our deceased.

00:44:47.093 --> 00:44:50.025 align:middle line:84%
And dreaming is absolutely
central to that vast field

00:44:50.025 --> 00:44:50.620 align:middle line:90%
of healing.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So we can heal
relationships with people who

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.320 align:middle line:84%
have passed away
through our dreams.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.362 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes, absolutely.

00:44:56.362 --> 00:44:57.486 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: How does that work?

00:44:57.486 --> 00:45:00.165 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, our departed are
trying to get in touch with us.

00:45:00.165 --> 00:45:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: They definitely are.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Far most of the
deceased are trying to reach us

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.290 align:middle line:90%
than the other way around.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:06.065 align:middle line:84%
Although there are plenty of
people in this reality who'd

00:45:06.065 --> 00:45:07.940 align:middle line:90%
like to talk to their deceased.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I facilitate that and offer
simple methods for doing it.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.120 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had a fireman
in once of my early workshops.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.920 align:middle line:84%
His wife died
three years before.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.370 align:middle line:84%
He's a one-woman guy,
salt of the earth guy,

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.614 align:middle line:90%
Irish-American, Tom, guy.

00:45:20.614 --> 00:45:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And he's been all
over the place looking

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.710 align:middle line:84%
for people who could
facilitate direct contact.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:25.971 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't dreamed of her.

00:45:25.971 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't trust the psychics
who are giving messages.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.411 align:middle line:84%
He wants direct
contact with his wife.

00:45:30.411 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So I say, OK, we're
going to do a journey.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.243 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to tap the drum.

00:45:33.243 --> 00:45:36.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going to imagine a place,
remember a place where you've

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.044 align:middle line:84%
been together and
start out there.

00:45:38.044 --> 00:45:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually he finds himself
traveling to another place

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.668 align:middle line:90%
from the place he remembered.

00:45:41.668 --> 00:45:43.580 align:middle line:84%
He finds her very busy
in another reality.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.666 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't look
up to begin with.

00:45:45.666 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:90%
He says, don't you love me?

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:47.755 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure I love you, Tom.

00:45:47.755 --> 00:45:49.547 align:middle line:84%
But I've got things
to do here, and you've

00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:50.838 align:middle line:90%
got a lot of life ahead of you.

00:45:50.838 --> 00:45:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and enjoy it.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:55.709 align:middle line:84%
And he's got mixed feelings,
comes back, tears, joy.

00:45:55.709 --> 00:45:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Six months later I see
him in the produce section

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.300 align:middle line:90%
of the supermarket.

00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.172 align:middle line:90%
He's lost 30 pounds.

00:45:59.172 --> 00:46:00.380 align:middle line:90%
He looks really good, tanned.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:01.580 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, after my wife
gave me permission,

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I dated that girl-- 67 years
old girl-- from the church,

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and we just are back
from our honeymoon.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So that was a case of
facilitating a journey

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.100 align:middle line:90%
to meet the departed.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But the deceased are looking
for us in our dreams.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.530 align:middle line:84%
If we could only wake up to
what's going on in the night,

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.331 align:middle line:84%
we have the simplest
form of communication.

00:46:20.331 --> 00:46:22.580 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts of
conscious wide-awake techniques

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.210 align:middle line:84%
you can use to
establish and maintain

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:90%
this kind of communication.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest that the
most common, most serviceable,

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.430 align:middle line:84%
most practical way to get
together with your deceased

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:34.360 align:middle line:84%
for healing and
mutual understanding

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.977 align:middle line:84%
is to pay more
attention to dreams

00:46:35.977 --> 00:46:37.310 align:middle line:90%
in which they may be showing up.

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:38.351 align:middle line:90%
They may be visiting you.

00:46:38.351 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:90%
They may still be around.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Or you may be traveling
into their realms.

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:43.190 align:middle line:90%
We do it all the time.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Wow.

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:45.330 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'll approach
another subject here,

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:53.660 align:middle line:84%
one that I think is important to
what you're trying to tell us.

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:56.110 align:middle line:84%
One of my old
friends, a guy I think

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:84%
you know or are familiar
with, was Terence McKenna.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was a neoshaman,
I guess you could say.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And he advocated taking
tremendous amounts

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:06.814 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic plants.

00:47:06.814 --> 00:47:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Uh-huh.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.044 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And I want to know
what you think about that.

00:47:11.044 --> 00:47:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: I have no interest.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.626 align:middle line:84%
I don't judge those
who take them.

00:47:13.626 --> 00:47:14.540 align:middle line:90%
I've never used them.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.100 align:middle line:90%
I've never needed them.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But then I have a story
which is although not unique,

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.630 align:middle line:84%
perhaps exceptional,
in my childhood

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:26.590 align:middle line:84%
in the kind of dying and coming
back that I did and in the fact

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that the dream world has
always been my default reality.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.770 align:middle line:84%
My sense of identity
and continuity

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.430 align:middle line:84%
has never been based on this
body or even on this identity.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been like that
since my boyhood.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Because of your
earlier death experiences.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Well, yes.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.563 align:middle line:84%
Or you can put it
the other way round.

00:47:38.563 --> 00:47:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the death experiences
were related to that

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
rather than the death
experiences triggering it,

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.260 align:middle line:90%
but certainly since childhood.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The gift of experiences like
that is often the person who's

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:49.970 align:middle line:84%
been through them is
very at home in worlds

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:50.960 align:middle line:90%
beyond the physical.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.418 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
been at home there.

00:47:52.418 --> 00:47:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I've had to struggle to find
my way in the physical world.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.901 align:middle line:84%
So I've never had any use for
consciousness-altering drugs.

00:47:57.901 --> 00:48:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I drink alcohol, but that's
to slow me down and narrow

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.380 align:middle line:84%
the gates of perception rather
than to open them wider.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't judge people who use
psychedelics, because the dream

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.450 align:middle line:84%
ability is so
atrophied, particularly

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:10.885 align:middle line:90%
in certainly Western men.

00:48:10.885 --> 00:48:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Mm hmm.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Many
people may need it.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But I have no interest
in going, for example,

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:17.250 align:middle line:84%
to take a drug whose
native name means

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.770 align:middle line:84%
"that which makes me puke"
in order to meet an anaconda

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.870 align:middle line:84%
spirit or the spirit
of a dead headhunter.

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:24.432 align:middle line:90%
That has no interest to me.

00:48:24.432 --> 00:48:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And I would counsel
those who do it

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to be very careful about
what group they're with

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.300 align:middle line:90%
and what happens afterwards.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Dreaming doesn't
require chemicals.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And the most
powerful true shamans

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:90%
don't need psychedelics.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.057 align:middle line:84%
They do it by flicking a
switch inside themselves.

00:48:39.057 --> 00:48:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not calling myself one
of the most powerful shamans,

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:44.050 align:middle line:84%
but I do everything I do in
consciousness, other than when

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm drumming in a workshop,
by flicking that inner switch.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:47.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't use anything else.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And there's direct
relationships between dreams,

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.530 align:middle line:84%
brain chemistries,
and these compounds.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So there might be a lot
of truth to the fact

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the
dreaming in the West

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.040 align:middle line:84%
is that the ability to dream
is atrophying, especially

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.590 align:middle line:84%
among people like Terence who
were trying to be scientists

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and very, very left
brain kind of people.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they had to just do
it because there was no escape.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, maybe it's
impeding the functioning

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.410 align:middle line:84%
of the brain to
receive, to act--

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.000 align:middle line:84%
serve as a transceiver for
experiences within the greater

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.160 align:middle line:90%
realm of mind.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.840 align:middle line:84%
If we accept that the
brain is inside the mind,

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.590 align:middle line:84%
that the interesting
dreams are not simply

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:30.860 align:middle line:84%
a product of brain functioning
but maybe experiences

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.562 align:middle line:84%
within the world of mind or
the larger reality, what we're

00:49:33.562 --> 00:49:35.020 align:middle line:84%
really talking
about is the ability

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.570 align:middle line:84%
of your brain to function
as an accurate and helpful

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:38.620 align:middle line:90%
transceiver.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:40.306 align:middle line:84%
If your brain isn't
working as something

00:49:40.306 --> 00:49:41.680 align:middle line:84%
which can receive
these messages,

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.510 align:middle line:84%
maybe psychedelics
will alter the brain

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.290 align:middle line:84%
in a way which makes
you more receptive,

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.150 align:middle line:84%
but they might also
generate brain-centered,

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:51.250 align:middle line:84%
chemically-produced
phenomena which

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.790 align:middle line:84%
are not the authentic reality
that real shamans, mystics,

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:55.980 align:middle line:90%
and others want to get to.

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:59.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't typically use, not
the most powerful ones-- they

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.281 align:middle line:84%
don't typically use
any of this stuff.

00:50:01.281 --> 00:50:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: No.

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of the dream
cultures of the past

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:08.400 align:middle line:84%
were completely clean
of all that stuff.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.514 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, my
personal dream college--

00:50:10.514 --> 00:50:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I founded my own dream
school, you know.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I train teachers
of active dreaming,

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.346 align:middle line:84%
and they're operating
all over the world

00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:16.655 align:middle line:90%
now, from Romania to Brazil.

00:50:16.655 --> 00:50:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Good.

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: But with no
organization, no hierarchy,

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.310 align:middle line:84%
no foundation money,
just as dreamers doing

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:24.880 align:middle line:84%
their spontaneous
thing, fresh thing.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.970 align:middle line:84%
We're a drug-free
dreaming culture.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:28.840 align:middle line:84%
We do our thing, and
we've got so good

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that we can take
50 people and have

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.210 align:middle line:84%
them travel together
somewhere very interesting,

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:33.920 align:middle line:84%
maybe to a different
cultural or a different time

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and bring back
group logs, produce

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.790 align:middle line:84%
group logs recording
the whole experience.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:42.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the real science
of dream experience.

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:45.750 align:middle line:84%
There was one PhD
researcher, William Dement--

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:90%
don't play with the name.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.450 align:middle line:90%
He was not demented.

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.250 align:middle line:84%
William Dement was
a really good guy--

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:52.270 align:middle line:84%
who said that the real
science of dreaming

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:56.180 align:middle line:84%
must take place inside the
dream state, not around it.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.930 align:middle line:84%
That is where the real
science of dreaming

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:00.291 align:middle line:84%
will be developed, through
experiences inside the dream

00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:00.790 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:01.939 align:middle line:90%
That is correct.

00:51:01.939 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And you become better
and better at it once you

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:07.420 align:middle line:84%
understand the topography
and the language, right?

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.636 align:middle line:84%
The topography and the language,
we develop our own geographies.

00:51:11.636 --> 00:51:15.010 align:middle line:84%
By the way, all our geographies
of the afterlife and imaginal

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:17.299 align:middle line:84%
realms come from this
kind of experience.

00:51:17.299 --> 00:51:18.340 align:middle line:90%
It gets sort of codified.

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.899 align:middle line:90%
It gets ossified sometimes.

00:51:19.899 --> 00:51:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the Egyptian
books of the dead

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:24.200 align:middle line:84%
or "The Tibetan
Book of the Dead"

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.140 align:middle line:84%
or the tales of
the Celtic Imrama,

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the voyage tales, these all come
from journeys in consciousness,

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.180 align:middle line:84%
which can often be
called dreams or visions.

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.700 align:middle line:84%
That's where they come from,
then they get codified.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.200 align:middle line:84%
But this stuff is too important
to know about second-hand.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.790 align:middle line:90%
You want direct experience.

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:40.164 align:middle line:84%
So this is a path of
direct experience,

00:51:40.164 --> 00:51:41.330 align:middle line:90%
and that's what people want.

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:42.539 align:middle line:90%
They're hungry for it.

00:51:42.539 --> 00:51:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.780 align:middle line:84%
One of my good friends who's
living in Australia, Robert

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Lawlor, he lived
with the Aborigines

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:51.410 align:middle line:84%
for about four years,
and they trusted him.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:53.005 align:middle line:90%
He's a very trustworthy guy.

00:51:53.005 --> 00:51:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote, I think,
probably the best book

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.190 align:middle line:84%
about the Aborigines,
"Voices of the First Day."

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And he told me a story
that he was with the tribe,

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.730 align:middle line:90%
and they went to a stone.

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It was just a stone,
a rock, a boulder

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.400 align:middle line:90%
in Australia in the Outback.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.130 align:middle line:84%
They sat in a circle
around this boulder,

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and he asked somebody,
what are we doing?

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
well, this boulder

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:18.910 align:middle line:84%
has a direct relationship
to this star over there.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:19.950 align:middle line:90%
And he said, OK.

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:22.116 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't quite understand
what they were doing.

00:52:22.116 --> 00:52:24.292 align:middle line:84%
And they all went into
a sort of a sleep.

00:52:24.292 --> 00:52:25.500 align:middle line:90%
He said they weren't snoring.

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.764 align:middle line:84%
They were just
quiet, laying down.

00:52:27.764 --> 00:52:28.680 align:middle line:90%
And he just sat there.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.305 align:middle line:84%
He didn't understand
what was going on.

00:52:30.305 --> 00:52:31.830 align:middle line:84%
After about four
hours, they were

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.850 align:middle line:90%
all up and talking excitedly.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And they had traveled
as a group to the star,

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and they were talking about
incidences within the dreams.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Did you see that
purple-faced person?

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, we talked, and
he showed me a couple things.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
he, Robert, finally

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.830 align:middle line:84%
understood that this was
not a fantasy of any kind.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.400 align:middle line:84%
This was actually a reality that
he could actually test and see.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:00.725 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is actually
typical of dreaming cultures.

00:53:00.725 --> 00:53:01.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a typical exercise.

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It's also a typical
training practice

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:07.090 align:middle line:84%
in shamanic dreaming traditions
that you'll take the apprentice

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and send him on assignment.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.350 align:middle line:84%
You'll only give him a few
details of where he's going.

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:11.915 align:middle line:84%
Then the elders who've
been there before

00:53:11.915 --> 00:53:13.960 align:middle line:84%
will check whether he
got the rest of it right.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: That's
exactly what they did.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: So that becomes part
of the training exercise.

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.388 align:middle line:84%
You with your Egyptian
interests would probably

00:53:18.388 --> 00:53:19.890 align:middle line:84%
be very interested
in the journeys

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.721 align:middle line:84%
to the Sirius star system
that I have led personally.

00:53:22.721 --> 00:53:24.970 align:middle line:84%
An early version is described
in my book "Dreamgates,"

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.620 align:middle line:84%
to play pushy
author for a moment.

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.767 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Go for it.

00:53:27.767 --> 00:53:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm really interested in Sirius.

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: And you'll be
interested in the language

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:33.520 align:middle line:84%
used, both for Sirius and for
the vehicle for the voyaging

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and other details.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.540 align:middle line:84%
The first journey of this
kind that I led-- I've

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.206 align:middle line:84%
stopped leading that
particular journey,

00:53:39.206 --> 00:53:41.470 align:middle line:84%
but you'll be interested
to see how it was done.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was inspired both
by Egyptian traditions

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and by the traditions
of the Dogon of Mali--

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: That's right.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: --who saw Sirius B 50
years before astronomers found

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:48.760 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So I know this kind of
practice, and I lead it.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually, for me,
probably the most interesting

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.910 align:middle line:84%
single aspect of what I do,
other than the very everyday

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.350 align:middle line:84%
practical functions
of what I do,

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:84%
which are to give people
power, including the ability

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.230 align:middle line:84%
to remember and live
and tell their bigger

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and braver story
in everyday life.

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm a storyteller.

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:08.667 align:middle line:84%
When people ask me on
airplanes "what do you do?"

00:54:08.667 --> 00:54:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I'll sometimes say,
well, I'm a storyteller,

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and my great pleasure is to
help other people wake up

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.880 align:middle line:84%
to their bigger and bolder
story and live it and tell it

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.110 align:middle line:84%
so well that they entertain
the spirits, including

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:20.780 align:middle line:90%
their own creative spirit.

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So we want to get people in
touch with the bigger story.

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that,
Jay, as you know,

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:27.740 align:middle line:84%
if you're in touch
with your deeper story,

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
you have courage
and resources to get

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.100 align:middle line:84%
through all the
downsides of life.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.119 align:middle line:90%
Healing flows from that.

00:54:32.119 --> 00:54:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.475 align:middle line:84%
Once you know your
own story, fear

00:54:35.475 --> 00:54:37.181 align:middle line:84%
is the first thing
that's jettisoned,

00:54:37.181 --> 00:54:38.680 align:middle line:84%
because you know
where you're going.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: You can
step through it.

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: You can step
through the fear more easily.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll put it that way.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: That's right.

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.415 align:middle line:84%
Because you know
where you're headed.

00:54:43.415 --> 00:54:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yeah.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:43.976 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:54:43.976 --> 00:54:45.476 align:middle line:84%
And then you create
your own reality

00:54:45.476 --> 00:54:47.372 align:middle line:84%
through that, the creation
of your own story.

00:54:47.372 --> 00:54:48.080 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.746 align:middle line:84%
You have to find out
what your story is.

00:54:49.746 --> 00:54:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yeah.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Courage is fear conquered
by something stronger,

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.991 align:middle line:84%
whether that is love or
faith or a bigger story,

00:54:55.991 --> 00:54:57.990 align:middle line:84%
the story that will get
you through the clashing

00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:59.860 align:middle line:84%
rocks which are supposed
to be impassable.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.380 align:middle line:84%
What is that story
that will take

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.210 align:middle line:90%
you, that will be your helmsman?

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.751 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:55:02.751 --> 00:55:05.002 align:middle line:90%
So tell us more about Sirius.

00:55:05.002 --> 00:55:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Oh, that's
enough for now.

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.140 align:middle line:90%
You go get the book.

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:07.610 align:middle line:90%
You try it.

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:08.859 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: I'll have to read it.

00:55:08.859 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got me
intrigued, because I'm

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.449 align:middle line:90%
really interested in Sirius.

00:55:12.449 --> 00:55:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, you know
perfectly well that

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.740 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians, at least when
they knew what they were doing,

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.344 align:middle line:84%
regarded Sirius, the Dog Star,
as the place where you get

00:55:21.344 --> 00:55:23.760 align:middle line:84%
in touch with the origin and
purpose of human life on this

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.100 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.475 align:middle line:84%
It is a place from which higher
intelligences made a link

00:55:26.475 --> 00:55:28.305 align:middle line:84%
with an evolving life
form on this planet.

00:55:28.305 --> 00:55:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: That's right.

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: That's my personal
mythology about these things.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Well, the Egyptians
believed that we came from

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.085 align:middle line:90%
Sirius.

00:55:33.085 --> 00:55:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: I think they
may not be wrong.

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:36.684 align:middle line:84%
Although there may be
other species among us.

00:55:36.684 --> 00:55:37.600 align:middle line:90%
That's enough of that.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.816 align:middle line:84%
I'm drawing the line
on Sirius for now.

00:55:39.816 --> 00:55:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Got it.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.330 align:middle line:90%
You got me hooked.

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll read it.

00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Although
yesterday on the plane,

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I found myself next to a
brilliantly vital 76-year-old

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:51.210 align:middle line:84%
woman who speaks with the same
Anglo-Australian accent exactly

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:52.869 align:middle line:90%
that I do who is an astronomer.

00:55:52.869 --> 00:55:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And the last part
of the conversation

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:56.975 align:middle line:84%
was about what she calls
the Dog Star, Sirius.

00:55:56.975 --> 00:55:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Really?

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.169 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:55:59.169 --> 00:56:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: One coincidence
after another here.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yes.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: All right.

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have four or
five minutes left.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
what you want

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.630 align:middle line:90%
to leave everybody with here.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
saying, I think,

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:11.490 align:middle line:84%
is actually some of the
most important things

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:11.820 align:middle line:90%
that we've presented.

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: Well, I'll tell a
story from a native culture,

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:17.470 align:middle line:84%
dreaming culture that I was
tempted to tell you when you

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:19.410 align:middle line:84%
asked where are the
masters today, et cetera.

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.785 align:middle line:84%
So this is a teaching
story of the Makiritare,

00:56:21.785 --> 00:56:24.009 align:middle line:90%
a dreaming people of Venezuela.

00:56:24.009 --> 00:56:25.800 align:middle line:84%
It's about their first
shaman, their foofi,

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.320 align:middle line:90%
their first shaman.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a time of darkness.

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.680 align:middle line:84%
People have fallen from
memory of the gods,

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.850 align:middle line:90%
the spirits, the dreams.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:34.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
their dreams anymore.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So they're living and
mating with anacondas

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.877 align:middle line:90%
and wild pigs, peccaries.

00:56:37.877 --> 00:56:39.960 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong with
anacondas or peccaries,

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.150 align:middle line:84%
but a human who falls to that
level has lost something,

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:44.150 align:middle line:90%
I think we could agree.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Yeah.

00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: So in this
dark time, Medatia,

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.220 align:middle line:84%
the name of the first
shaman-to-be, starts dreaming.

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.080 align:middle line:84%
He dreams so strongly,
he spirals up

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.230 align:middle line:84%
through the thatched
roof of his hut.

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:54.940 align:middle line:84%
He spirals up through
a cloud barrier

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.620 align:middle line:84%
into a world above
this one where

00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.170 align:middle line:84%
he meets a being he regards
as a master or a God.

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And he falls down to
worship this master or god

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.040 align:middle line:84%
until he wakes up to the fact
that this master or god is

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.180 align:middle line:84%
his own self on that
higher level of reality.

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.630 align:middle line:84%
He only understands this
when his senses are cleansed.

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.900 align:middle line:84%
He's bathed in a pool
of electric blue fire.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.330 align:middle line:90%
His senses are changed.

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Then he's able to see
that the master is not

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.710 align:middle line:90%
some being above him.

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It is his self on
a higher level.

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.940 align:middle line:90%
This is repeated 10 times.

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.772 align:middle line:84%
Now the Makiritare take
days to tell this story.

00:57:24.772 --> 00:57:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're Westerners
sitting in a studio.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just say
he goes through this

00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:32.016 align:middle line:84%
with all the details
changing 10 times.

00:57:32.016 --> 00:57:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And now he's somewhat
different, because he's

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.130 align:middle line:90%
absorbed the songs.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:38.145 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge is
coded in the songs.

00:57:38.145 --> 00:57:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Right.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: He's absorbed the songs
of the masters or gods on 10

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.120 align:middle line:90%
levels above his ordinary self.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And now he's told he's got to go
back down there, a place where

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.230 align:middle line:90%
people live as pigs and snakes.

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:50.055 align:middle line:90%
Does he want to go?

00:57:50.055 --> 00:57:50.670 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:52.130 align:middle line:90%
But he has an assignment.

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:53.620 align:middle line:90%
He's made to go back.

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And now he's
different, because he's

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.640 align:middle line:84%
carrying the songs of the 10
higher levels of the self.

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But he's also
carrying compassion.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.080 align:middle line:84%
He can see where people
have a hole in themselves

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.413 align:middle line:90%
because part of them is missing.

00:58:04.413 --> 00:58:06.320 align:middle line:84%
He can read the colors
of their feelings.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And he starts calling the
dream souls of his people

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:09.740 align:middle line:90%
to him at night.

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Come to me, lost soul.

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:13.290 align:middle line:84%
[WHISTLES] I'm
whistling to guide you.

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:14.750 align:middle line:90%
You're walking on moonlight.

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And one by one, he
instructs the dream souls

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and sends them back to the
bodies of the sleepers so

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that in the morning
as they wake,

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.840 align:middle line:84%
they remember something from
their dreams and with it

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.560 align:middle line:90%
something of human purpose.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And they return from the
wallows of the peccaries

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and the anacondas to live a
halfway decent human life.

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:33.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a story about dreaming.

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: I like that.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: And that's a
story about masters too.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want a master
who's up there.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: No.

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MOSS: I want to be in touch
with the self just a little bit

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.430 align:middle line:84%
higher that I can talk to,
have a sit down on a terrace

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:44.351 align:middle line:90%
overlooking the world.

00:58:44.351 --> 00:58:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I actually write about
this in some of my books,

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:48.850 align:middle line:84%
my double on the balcony,
one of my poems in "Here

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything is Dreaming,"
my poetry collection.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Double on the Balcony."

00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:54.610 align:middle line:84%
It's about conversations
with that self

00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:57.340 align:middle line:84%
on a slightly higher level
who doesn't judge but has

00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.880 align:middle line:84%
a perspective that I lack
down here in the marketplace

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:01.445 align:middle line:84%
of the world, as
the Yoruba call it.

00:59:01.445 --> 00:59:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Mm hmm.

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that is an amazing
way to end this show.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:05.960 align:middle line:90%
It's been a great show.

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.320 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.514 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody
needs to pay attention

00:59:10.514 --> 00:59:12.180 align:middle line:84%
to what your higher
self is telling you,

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:16.310 align:middle line:84%
because it really has your
best interest at heart always.

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:16.996 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: Yeah.

00:59:16.996 --> 00:59:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Thanks, Robert.

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>> MOSS: My pleasure.

00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: The rebirth of shamanism
in our modern world is one

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.371 align:middle line:90%
of the most hopeful signs ever.

00:59:22.371 --> 00:59:24.480 align:middle line:84%
By combining the
ancient with the modern,

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Robert Moss has done much to
guide us towards our destiny.

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Go to the bookstore and
get his books, Robert Moss.

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Robert.

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jay Weidner for
"The Healing Matrix,"

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.110 align:middle line:90%
right here on Gaiam TV.

00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:57.767 align:middle line:90%
