00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
actress, Suzanne Summers,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:10%
took the subject of
natural hormone replacement

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:10%
main stream, a
subject near and dear

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:10%
to those who suffered the
symptoms of menopause.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.049 align:middle line:10%
In truth, it's a
household problem.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:10%
Not only do women
find themselves out

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:10%
of balance hormonally, so
do men and even children.

Laura Thompson is a
naturopathic endocrinologist,

who specializes in helping
the whole family get

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
their wits about them
through natural hormone

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:90%
therapies and food.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.730 align:middle line:84%
She joins us today to give
us some very useful guidance

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.150 align:middle line:84%
in regaining our sunny
dispositions individually

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and as a family.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure a high
percentage of the viewers

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:10%
right now want to
know what you have

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:10%
to say because,
if not themselves,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:10%
we've all suffered through a lot
of these kinds of dysfunctions

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.645 align:middle line:10%
that happen as a result,
honestly, of our own behaviors,

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:10%
and what we've
done to ourselves.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, haven't we
pretty much trashed

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:10%
our own immune systems,
hormonal systems,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:10%
endocrine systems
through trying to live

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.025 align:middle line:10%
the kind of out of balance
life that we live in the west?

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:10%
>>LAURA THOMPSON:
That's so true.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:10%
It actually all comes down to
stress and the various list

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:10%
of stressors that we have
in our lives, anything

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.320 align:middle line:10%
from missing a meal,
to traumatic stress,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:10%
to overwhelm, to lots of work,
I mean, dietary stressors,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:10%
radiation, environmental
stressors, I mean,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:10%
the list goes on and on.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.477 align:middle line:10%
And all of those affect
the hormone balance.

00:01:41.477 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I was going to ask
you just while we're on it,

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:10%
you just listed off-- you
ticked off several things that

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:10%
are impacted by stress.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:10%
Does-- the ways in which
our bodies are impacted.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:10%
Is wireless technologies,
a lot of these kind

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:10%
of unseen RF frequencies,
and EMF frequencies,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:10%
do they also lend
to that portrait.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.427 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: I was thinking
about this the other day,

00:02:03.427 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:84%
because the whole idea about
stress is can you adapt

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:90%
or can't you?

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: And what
occurs hormonally

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in that whole transition
toward adaptation.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
OK, we're dealing

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of wireless
radiation, and how is--

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.888 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this stuff is going in
and out and through our bodies,

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
how is that-- how is that
impacting our nervous system?

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:90%
How is it impacting our brains?

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:84%
It is, and it could
be hyper stimulating.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It could be affecting
our neurotransmitters.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Among all these
stressors you're talking about,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:10%
another one that
occurs to me that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:10%
is kind of silent and
invisible, is that of radiation.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:10%
Not just radiation,
but frequencies,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:10%
such as radio frequencies,
EMFs, and so forth.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:10%
And we know studies
have been done

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:10%
in the US, a lot of
them out of Australia

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:10%
as well, where there have been
hubs with lots of wireless

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:10%
and business environments,
for example, are at home,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:10%
there is a cluster
of tumors that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:10%
will grow in the people
in that-- especially

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:10%
breast tumors.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so what's
it doing to us?

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah, it's
severely impacting

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
our nervous systems,
our immune systems,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
creating hypersensitivities,
and most likely

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
suppressing immune function,
and how the body actually

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:84%
responds to other
things that are supposed

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
to be dealing with, but it's
not because the radiation is

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:90%
affecting it.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.033 align:middle line:84%
But my positive take on it all,
is that we're going to adapt.

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, that's
what I was going to ask you.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: We're
going to adapt.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why our adrenal
glands are in our bodies,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.780 align:middle line:90%
because that's their job.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And we may not be
there yet, but you

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
know we're always ever
advancing, and will adapt.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that's really
interesting because even with

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:10%
Fukushima and some really
severe cases where we're looking

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:10%
at having to adapt to
large amounts of radiation,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:10%
people have had--

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:10%
some people adapted fine.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.293 align:middle line:10%
Even with Hiroshima
in World War II,

00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:10%
there are people that
lived through that

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.457 align:middle line:10%
and adapted just fine to those
high levels of radiation.

00:03:58.457 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: I think
some of that comes

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:10%
down to just what kind
of a detoxifier are you.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: What are your
detoxification abilities,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and how strong is the gut
in being able to actually

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:84%
stay sealed, and not allow
things into the system,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and how great are your
eliminative organs,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:84%
the bowel, the
kidneys, the lymph

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.133 align:middle line:84%
in being able to eliminate the
stuff that comes into contact?

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, and we're
going to go into the guts

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:10%
in a little bit in some
detail, because there's

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:10%
a cycle I'm really fascinated
with that you specialize in.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:10%
But before we get
into that cycle,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to talk a
little bit more--

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.042 align:middle line:10%
you brought up the
adrenals, it seems

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:10%
like everyone I interview, all
paths, especially clinicians,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:10%
all paths seem to lead
back to the adrenals.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, they're
our intermediaries.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
They are the connectors between
your external environment

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and your internal environment.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And they and the
brain work together

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.186 align:middle line:84%
in helping us live in this
world, whatever that might be.

00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Might be dealing with a
sick house syndrome, mold,

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
something somebody
just said to you.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody is quickly
running down the hall right now

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:90%
and I jump.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:10%
How do I-- how do
I react to that?

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.950 align:middle line:84%
My adrenal glands, my
brain are working together

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to help me create a balancing
act with it all or not.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of that leads to this
incredible hormonal cascade,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
which then tips off all the
different hormones in the body,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
not the least of which
is the sex hormones.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But those adrenal glands
play such a huge role

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.372 align:middle line:84%
in how pretty much
everything else happens.

00:05:44.372 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so,
we're essentially

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:10%
on adrenal overload
as a society,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:10%
or adrenal depletion,
whatever you want to call it.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:10%
I mean both, I suppose, because
we're choosing to live a life.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just the mere fact that
we're in the information age

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:10%
really has changed the way
in which our adrenals have

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:10%
to function.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:10%
I've forgotten the--

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:10%
I've forgotten the
statistics exactly,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:10%
but it's something
like our minds

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:10%
are having to take in
50,000 times more data

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.532 align:middle line:10%
than they had to a
100 years ago just

00:06:15.532 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:10%
through all the forms
of media that we're

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:10%
surrounded with on a
day in, day out basis.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.427 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a lot of input.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:90%
We weren't designed for that.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.408 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well,
we weren't, but I

00:06:25.408 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
think we're designing ourselves
for that, in that direction.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
great thing about man.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:90%
We can change.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:90%
And we can create newness.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.480 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
have strong organs.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have to-- and in
regards to the adrenals,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:84%
we have to really protect
them, and support them, and not

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
disregard them,
and cast them aside

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
with alcohol, with
caffeine, with white sugar,

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and with chemicals, and
all the processed foods.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that stuff.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, a
party here or there.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:84%
We can't carry on
like that every day.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to really honor
the fact that these glands,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, need
nutrients, and need

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
function well in order

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to do what you want
to do, which is

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:90%
to lead a passion, joyful life.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:10%
And in Eastern medicine,
the glands and the organs

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:10%
are honored.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's not uncommon
to talk about your liver,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:10%
for example, or your kidneys.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:10%
In this culture,
unless you've just

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:10%
been in for lab
tests or something,

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:10%
we don't tend to
think about what's

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:10%
encased behind skin and bones.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But that is-- if we were looking
at it as an entity of its own,

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:90%
which they are.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:90%
The organs are.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:10%
If you look at it from more
of an esoteric point of view,

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:10%
they're very much
their own entities

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:10%
with their own mind, their
own information systems

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:10%
and means of communicating.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:10%
How would you
characterize the adrenals

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:10%
as an independent member
of your community?

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, they're
the glands of boldness,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:90%
and courage, and strength.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
They can also be, though,
the glands of fear,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and self degradation,
and depression.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But, hopefully, we're a
happy mix of all that.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:10%
And, again, we have
to honor the fact

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.070 align:middle line:10%
that they do need
nutrients, and they do need

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:10%
mental emotional balancing--

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Care
and consideration,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:10%
just like we do as a whole.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about some
of the hormones that

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:10%
are depleted when we get into
more of the self-deprecating

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:10%
and fear end of the use
of our educational glands,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:10%
and they start becoming
out of balance.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:84%
What is the cascade effect
in the sex hormones?

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, you see, the
important thing to remember

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
is that all hormones
start with cholesterol.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And, in other words, the
steroid hormones-- steroids

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.400 align:middle line:90%
means from fat or from lipid.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And so, cholesterol
is the building block.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you go in
to pregnenolone, and then

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:84%
progesterone, and I won't go
through the whole pathway,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:84%
but suffice it to say that
the adrenal glands make

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:84%
the adrenal hormones, the
stress hormones, cortisol, DHA,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and adrenaline, and
such, but they also

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:90%
make the sex hormones.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:10%
And one of the problems
that occurs, especially

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:10%
after a person has
years of stress,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:10%
is that their adrenal glands
get taxed, tapped out,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:10%
and then they're less able to
be the backup system for the sex

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:10%
hormone production,
which we sorely rely on

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:10%
in middle age, when the sex
hormones begin to decline,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:10%
estrogen, progesterone, and
testosterone begin to decline,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:10%
and the body wants the
adrenal glands to kick in.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And the adrenal glands say,
hey, what are you kidding?

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm worn out.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting
anything from me.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: You got
to treat me right.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.787 align:middle line:10%
Well, you can say that the horse
has already bolted on that one

00:09:59.787 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:10%
if you've been treating your
body in a rough fashion all

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:10%
those years.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:10%
How does that impact--

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:10%
you're talking
about what happens

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:10%
when we go through our
middle years and menopause,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:10%
but what happens in
the younger years,

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:10%
let's say for women
and men, actually both,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.135 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to fertility?

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Oh boy.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So sad, today, the
fertility issues.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that we're
dealing with a severe fertility

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
problems because of the
environmental chemicals,

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:84%
which have an estrogen
effect in the body, which

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
affects both boys and girls,
teens and young adults.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
hormone replacements

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:90%
and in the birth control pill.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: And we have
steroid use among teenage boys,

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:90%
and young adult men, athletes.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of these affect
the hormone balance,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and all of these can throw
off the sex hormones.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think
that the fertility

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:84%
issue is it can be not only
affected, but can be remedied.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:90%
But all of these other--

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
all these aggravators
have to be handled.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And like, for instance, when I
get a girl that comes into me,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and she's coming to deal
with her blood sugar

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
problems, or her
depression, or her PMS,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and her parents
wanted to see me.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, she's most the
time on the birth control pill.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I always do my due
diligence to talk to them

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
about why they shouldn't
be on birth control pill.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And the what occurs is, that
most of the time I'm able to, I

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.173 align:middle line:84%
guess, get the fear into
them enough where they're--

00:11:42.173 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so what?

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.998 align:middle line:84%
So, let's say you're
the mother of a teenage,

00:11:44.998 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
or you're a teenage girl
watching this right now.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.582 align:middle line:84%
What's the lecture,
you would deliver

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%
regarding birth control?

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.972 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah,
so I would say, do--

00:11:51.972 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:84%
the birth control
pill is basically

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:90%
controlling the hormone system.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's basically telling
the body you're pregnant.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, you stay on the
pill for 10 years, 15 years,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:84%
20 years, and then you decide
you want to get pregnant,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and you go off the pill,
but the body's already

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.898 align:middle line:90%
been pregnant in a sense.

00:12:08.898 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
feedback system--

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Repeatedly.

00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Is telling you
that it's in a certain state.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden
you want it to perform and it

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:90%
can't.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
On top of all that, you get all
the toxins from the estrogen

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and progesterone residues
from the birth control pill,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and the toxification
of the liver,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of other
issues that occur when

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:90%
the body has chemical control.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So, essentially,
you'd recommend

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:10%
non-chemical, non-oral
forms of contraceptives

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.645 align:middle line:10%
of pretty much any kind, but
just don't take the pill.

00:12:44.645 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah, go back
to the old fashioned ways

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:84%
of doing things, condom and
you know just self-control.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think with
a lot of people,

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
they just don't want the
inconvenience of not knowing,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.412 align:middle line:84%
for example, when their
period's going to show up

00:12:58.412 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:84%
in the case of
girls, and it just

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:84%
seems like an easy conventional
way to do things now.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.953 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: OK, so
this is what I say,

00:13:03.953 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:84%
because this is what I hear,
the cramps, and the mood swings,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and the inconvenience.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, so what?

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:90%
You're a girl.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:90%
You're a woman.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Deal with.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
However, the reason we
have symptoms like that

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
is because we have
hormone imbalance.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So we can get the
hormones in balance.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, once
their hormones are in balance,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:90%
they don't have symptoms.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:84%
They go through the period
without pretty much blinking

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:90%
an eye.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
give us an example.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have a girl who
is suffering from cramps

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and all these things you just
mentioned that are painful,

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
unpleasant, just make life
miserable for a couple of days,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
what would you do to
that girl to balance

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
her hormones without
her taking anything

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.123 align:middle line:90%
like an oral contraceptive?

00:13:51.123 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:90%
What would your approach be?

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.165 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: I always go
back to the baseline,

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:10%
which is your food.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, what the information
you can give someone

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
about the food,
and the information

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
that they glean from their
body from eating certain foods

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:84%
or not, it's going
to last a lifetime.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I talk about
is, pretty much largely

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.645 align:middle line:90%
blood sugar.

00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:84%
How to keep the blood
sugar in balance,

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.228 align:middle line:84%
because when the blood
sugar is out of balance,

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
are hypoglycemic, which

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
means the blood
sugar gets low, well,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that sets up off a
whole cascade of events,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
not the least of which is
mood swings, bitchiness.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that
is not-- that does not

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:90%
relate just to women.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:90%
That's men as well.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Of course.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had a camera man,
one of my favorite cameramen

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.790 align:middle line:84%
ever, we're out in the
field doing a documentary

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and, oh boy, come three or
4 o'clock in the afternoon,

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
everyone knew we needed to
turn the lights on and scream

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
through the mountains to find a
coffee shop and something sweet

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
because he was so awful to
contend with after that.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Worst than any woman I knew
on PMS that had PMS going.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, this, do you do the
same-- would it be the same--

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, the same
recommendation for men, women,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.260 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:84%
This is just straight across
advice, balancing blood sugar.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: You have
to have a human body.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:90%
This is what you do.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.653 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: It's just that
I think with the women,

00:15:08.653 --> 00:15:11.087 align:middle line:90%
things seem more dramatic.

00:15:11.087 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it because
women are more expressive?

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: And more dramatic.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And more
dramatic, exactly.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.848 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just chatting
about it more

00:15:16.848 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:84%
where a guy may be
feeling miserable too,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.565 align:middle line:84%
but he's not necessarily
going to bring it up

00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:90%
at breakfast, right?

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah, And
I think women also--

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the truth
of the matter is,

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
there are cycles that
women go through.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And men go through cycles too,
but they're a lot more subtle.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, getting
the food in order

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and helping a young girl
eat five small meals a day--

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of times,
their schedules

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
are conducive to that,
especially if they're athletes.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And they just take
little snacks with them.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it's really a question
of doing the hormone testing.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to get
to that in just a minute.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:10%
But what often happens
for people in their teens,

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:10%
and once you have some wheels
and a little bit of freedom,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:10%
is you head to a place
like Starbucks, right?

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you would take
that afternoon snack

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into maybe a
triple venti vanilla latte.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And now you've got
caffeine in on it.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:10%
You have simple refined
sugars in on it.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:84%
What is that further doing to a
girl or a woman at this point?

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah,
you're creating a yo-yo.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're basically
stepping in for the adrenals.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's a stimulant
like sugar or caffeine

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
is going to step in
and say, hey, I'm here.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm the stimulant.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't need new
adrenals right now.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
body eventually

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
starts to rely on that, because
the body's own resources for it

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:90%
have been cast aside.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the cravings
ensue, and the habits form.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.637 align:middle line:10%
But, you know, not to say
that all of these things

00:16:50.637 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:10%
need to be eliminated
100%, because you know

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:10%
that's not going to happen.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.030 align:middle line:90%
We're human beings.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:90%
We're created--

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.553 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We just can't
live that lifestyle.

00:16:56.553 --> 00:16:57.720 align:middle line:90%
We can't do it as a daily--

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.358 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Lifestyle
is a good word.

00:16:59.358 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As a lifestyle.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- you were
just talking about cravings.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about sex.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
What happens with people
once you start really

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:84%
spending the adrenals
and you start going out

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.342 align:middle line:90%
of balance hormonally?

00:17:10.342 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:84%
We look at the birth rate
of various countries,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.925 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of it has
to do with choices,

00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
birth control, finances,
economics, and so forth.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:10%
But what's actually happening
to the modern person

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:10%
as a result of these
stressors and their sex drive?

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:10%
You see a lot of people
coming through your office.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.492 align:middle line:10%
What's happening to us?

00:17:29.492 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: Well, I see it
going both ways, you know?

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.350 align:middle line:10%
I see the low, and
I see the high.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:10%
And I'm talking about the low
for men too, not just women.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:10%
But I also work with people
who have sexual addictions.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we really
see the adrenal and the brain

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.310 align:middle line:84%
connection, the
neurotransmitters of the brain,

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
the brain chemicals
that interact

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:84%
with the adrenal glands and are
affected by various stressors

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:90%
that we mentioned before.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, a whole
cascade of events

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:90%
occurs with the brain chemicals.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:10%
But when the adrenal
glands are depleted,

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:10%
what that means is that the
body then cannot accurately,

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:10%
effectively deal with stressors.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the brain is
triggered in certain ways

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
to help sort of
balance things out.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the neurotransmitters
can either be deficient

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
or can be excreted
in high amounts.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of them--
dopamine, for instance--

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
is known when it's low to
actually cause a person

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:90%
to want to feel stimulated.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
caffeine can give you

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that jolt that if you
don't have dopamine,

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel some sort of
satisfaction or motivation.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.268 align:middle line:84%
The same with--
this is what I find

00:18:47.268 --> 00:18:49.352 align:middle line:84%
with people with sex
addictions is a lot of times,

00:18:49.352 --> 00:18:50.655 align:middle line:90%
their dopamine levels are low.

00:18:50.655 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.022 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: And
therefore, the body's

00:18:53.022 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
going to try and do something
to get it to go up so that it

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:90%
gets that sense of motivation.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:10%
And what about in the case where
your sexual desire is very low,

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:10%
which you hear that a lot?

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:90%
A lot that is age--

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
seems to be age-related
as well, of course.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:84%
But what about en
masse, I mean, even

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
among young people who normally
are kind of in those more

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
juicy years of
childbearing and such,

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.022 align:middle line:90%
but there's just no desire?

00:19:19.022 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: I had
a 16-year-old boy

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
in my office a
couple of weeks ago

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.510 align:middle line:90%
saying that his libido is low.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
He asked his mom to
go out of the room,

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:90%
and says that his libido is low.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
do you need it for?

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.705 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm just kidding.

00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:33.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:34.808 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:19:34.808 --> 00:19:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: No, he knew
his libido was low.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have that
thing that guys have.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
well, it's probably

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:middle line:90%
because your hormones are low.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
looking at here are

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
a variety of, in
the case of a guy,

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:90%
potential low testosterone.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we
look at with boys and men

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
is the ratio between
testosterone and estrogens,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
because nowadays with all
the estrogens in the dairy

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:90%
products and the environment--

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask you.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:10%
What if your household
is vegetarian,

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:10%
and you're living on
also maybe a lot of soy

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:10%
that has a high
estrogen content?

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.785 align:middle line:90%
What is that doing to the males?

00:20:11.785 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah, so it's
taking up the estrogen receptor

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:90%
sites in the body.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
It can be causing some
liver ineffectiveness.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And the liver is very important
for the production of hormones.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
The word that's used is
conjugation of hormones.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these foods
and environmental factors

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:90%
are upsetting the apple cart.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to do is
we have to analyze the diet,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:84%
see what needs to come out, and
help the liver and the gut work

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
more effectively, and then do
the normal hormone balancing

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.727 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:20:46.727 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting because you

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:84%
look at a lot of
third-world cultures

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
where you have birth rates of
up to seven to nine children,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But then again, you're looking
at people who oftentimes

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:90%
live very close to the land.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:84%
They're not interfacing
with a lot of technology

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:90%
if any technology at all.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
They're eating diets that
are much closer to the land

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.062 align:middle line:90%
and not processed.

00:21:07.062 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what I'm
saying is these women

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
tend to be a lot closer
to nature in every way

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:10%
Is this what you
think is responsible

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:10%
for these further high
fertility rates compared to us?

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: I think
that's part of it.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think also, the way
that women live today with

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
their very high testosterone
output because they're doing

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot of work, and they're
trying to maintain households,

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing man-woman
jobs at the same time--

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that's affecting the
balance of the sex hormones,

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's also affecting
the adrenal glands, which,

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
as I said before, are
not then available to be

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:90%
the backup system.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to talk about
the guts in just a moment.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a little
break because the guts are

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:90%
really key here.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:10%
We're back, and
we're going to start

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:10%
talking about our digestive
function and how all of that

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:10%
plays into it, particularly
with serotonin.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:10%
And we haven't talked
about serotonin yet,

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:10%
but that's that nice,
soft, feel-good thing.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:10%
That's why when we're
upset, we go and eat a donut

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:10%
and want a cup of
hot chocolate--

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:10%
all because our brain is craving
some production of serotonin

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:10%
to make us feel better.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.275 align:middle line:10%
How does this play into
the hormonal portrait?

00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:10%
Because we don't seem
to be running off

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:10%
of serotonin as a lot.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:10%
So when we have stress,
it depletes serotonin,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:10%
and it affects so many
events in the body that can

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:10%
cause a decrease in serotonin.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing
with the dietary issues

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
inflammatory problems

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
that occur in the gut
between the gluten

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and the wheat and the
casein and the dairy

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
products and the sugar and the
alcohol and the inflammation

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:84%
that the body incurs is one
of the destroying factors

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:90%
of serotonin.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So there is a huge dietary
influence on whether or not

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:90%
serotonin is produced.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:84%
90% to 95% of
serotonin is produced

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.428 align:middle line:84%
in the enteric nervous
system, in the gut

00:23:13.428 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:90%
and the intestinal tract.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.803 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what does that say?

00:23:15.803 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Say now, you've eaten
so much of that stuff.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:10%
We're allergic to
a lot of things,

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:10%
like you just said, a
lot of food allergies.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.730 align:middle line:10%
If we were originally
eating grains in order

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:10%
to help in the
production of serotonin,

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:10%
what happens now with people who
can't even eat grains anymore

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.980 align:middle line:10%
and can't eat a lot
of the foods that

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:10%
normally would have
easily inspired

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:10%
the production of serotonin?

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, it
comes down to how--

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
serotonin is made
from amino acids.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Amino acids are from protein.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So it really comes down
to how is your body

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.293 align:middle line:84%
actually digesting and absorbing
the protein that you're eating.

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: And what kind
of proteins are you eating?

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Are they able to then
become serotonin?

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean, it
doesn't necessarily

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.260 align:middle line:90%
have to do with the carbs.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the carbohydrate--

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.167 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why do we grab--
why do we reach for carbs?

00:24:03.167 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well,
it's-- yeah, I mean,

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of our intuitive
nature of what's going to get

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:84%
me there the quickest, which is
not necessarily always the best

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: But
the carb situation

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:84%
is such that if you eat
complex carbohydrates, which

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.870 align:middle line:84%
are the better ones, the brown
rice and that type of thing,

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:84%
then the body is going to
utilize the carbohydrates

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and break down in
a slower manner

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.760 align:middle line:84%
so that the body
gets more even fuel.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't necessarily
say that one

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
should bank on carbohydrates
to produce serotonin

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:84%
because if you do, you're
basically looking at a roller

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:46.387 align:middle line:84%
coaster effect, which could be
fun in a short period of time.

00:24:46.387 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, if you want to
go manic and then be depressed.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Great for manic depression.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But basically, that's
not really a way

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:90%
to have consistent happiness.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.280 align:middle line:10%
So you're saying really,
it's down to the quality,

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:10%
regardless of our
dietary restrictions,

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:10%
whether we're a raw foodist, a
vegan, a vegetarian, a lacto,

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:10%
ovo, whatever, or paleo,
on a paleo diet of mostly

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:10%
vegetables and proteins.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:10%
We have to find a
consistent source of protein

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:10%
that works well for our bodies.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Exactly, right.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It's those proteins
that actually break down

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:90%
to the various amino acids.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have this
discussion with--

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of people who
are on antidepressant meds.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I see a lot of people
who are on anti-anxiety meds

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and sleep medications.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And so most of time,
they're coming to me

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to get off of them.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, I can't take
you off your medication.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not my role.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
My role is to help your
body get to the point

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.890 align:middle line:84%
where you don't
need them anymore.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
are brainwashed

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that
they can never

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.325 align:middle line:84%
get off their
medications because this

00:25:53.325 --> 00:25:54.818 align:middle line:90%
is what they're told.

00:25:54.818 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're told this because
the people who are telling them

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
this, they're
psychiatrists, and whoever

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.253 align:middle line:90%
is prescribing for them--

00:26:01.253 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Someone
in a white coat.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: They don't know.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that the
brain chemicals are only

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:90%
made from nutrients.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
The brain chemicals
are made from minerals

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and amino acids and vitamin
C. And these nutrients,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.650 align:middle line:84%
they follow a particular cascade
with certain enzyme reactions

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
in the body and liver
function that all

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:90%
make the right thing happen.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the pathway
of minerals and nutrients

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and amino acids becomes
the final product,

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.890 align:middle line:90%
which is the neurotransmitter.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So if a person is getting
nourished properly

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and the gut is set up to be able
to absorb your food properly,

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.540 align:middle line:84%
then the potential is
that you can actually

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:84%
manufacture these
chemicals on your own,

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:90%
which is the way it should be.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:90%
This is how we were designed.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
if the food source

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.790 align:middle line:84%
is denuded of any
natural minerals?

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know
that even if you're

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:84%
talking about fresh
produce, unless it's

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:84%
raised in a very
conscious way, which

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:84%
used to be just the normal
way, a lot of the minerals

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:90%
are now missing from the diet.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So how do we start
replenishing the minerals,

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.390 align:middle line:90%
remineralize our body?

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you have some
suggestions for us, even

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
by way of supplementation
of reliable minerals

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to start kicking
this process back

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:84%
in so we can create our own
proper hormone spectrum?

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, first
of all, as you mentioned,

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:84%
using organic produce,
vegetables, and fruits,

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.128 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be getting a
highly mineralized soil, which

00:27:28.128 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
is going to pass it on to
the plant, and then the food,

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:90%
and then into your body.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, many studies have
looked at organic produce

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and shown that they are
much higher in nutrients.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's one.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I utilize lots of different
products in my practice.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I love the old coral
calcium minerals.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:84%
They are so pH balanced, and
the body just takes them up,

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.192 align:middle line:90%
just sort of takes it right in.

00:27:58.192 --> 00:28:00.150 align:middle line:84%
That happens to be one
of my favorite products.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Coral calcium, OK.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:90%
And what about CALM?

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.255 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people see this
on the shelf on sale

00:28:06.255 --> 00:28:08.850 align:middle line:10%
and such at the store, a
magnesium citrate product.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.650 align:middle line:10%
Is that good?

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: It has a
nice Band-Aid effect.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it having
an everlasting effect.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.770 align:middle line:90%
So I'm looking for--

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I like to use things that
work, that really work,

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
so that eventually, maybe
you don't need them anymore.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.277 align:middle line:10%
So you're talking about
something that was developed

00:28:24.277 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:10%
over eons of time in the sea.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:10%
And taking that in,
our body recognizes it

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.867 align:middle line:10%
because it's in its natural
form, the coral calcium

00:28:31.867 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:10%
that you're talking about.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's a good one.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:10%
Now let's go back to
the subject of serotonin

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:10%
specifically, just
focusing on that.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.970 align:middle line:84%
What are some other ways,
besides balancing our proteins

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:43.770 align:middle line:90%
out--

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.395 align:middle line:84%
and here we've just
talked a little bit

00:28:45.395 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:90%
about the coral calcium.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.180 align:middle line:84%
What are some
other ways to start

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:90%
boosting our serotonin levels?

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it seems critical.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to do that for
everything else to work, right?

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: I think that
people finding whatever

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.380 align:middle line:84%
it is that gets them to
what I call their center,

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:84%
whether that be through
prayer or meditation or yoga

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:84%
or just sitting calmly, reading,
you know, whatever it is.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.640 align:middle line:84%
That is going to enhance
serotonin production.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my mind, you could
do everything with your mind.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It really helps to have the
body functioning effectively

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:84%
to help the mind get
there more easily.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:84%
A ton of my patients
have said to me

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
after working on hormone
balancing and brain

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:84%
neurochemistry that they can
meditate more easily, that they

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
can focus better,
that they can actually

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.220 align:middle line:84%
get to a more peaceful place
because they don't have

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:84%
all the physical symptoms
and the interruptions

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that they had when they
weren't feeling as well.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.128 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:29:51.128 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, going back
to that link again

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.700 align:middle line:10%
in the disruption of the
digestive and elimination

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.210 align:middle line:10%
system, what happens if
your system isn't working

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.060 align:middle line:10%
very well anymore, and you
start throwing laxatives at it?

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.940 align:middle line:84%
What happens there in terms
of the production of serotonin

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.670 align:middle line:84%
then and the release of
serotonin in the body

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:84%
once you get to that
point in your elimination?

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, a
laxative is just creating

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.960 align:middle line:90%
a sort of superficial effect.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And really, lots of residues
result. I mean, in other words,

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.430 align:middle line:84%
things don't actually get
out of the body when--

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As a
result of using them.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.138 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that a little bit.

00:30:26.138 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:90%
What gets left behind?

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:84%
We think we're-- a lot of
people are really addicted

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to cleansing and stuff and
really throwing a lot of stuff

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:90%
at that.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:84%
What's the downside of
that aggressive kind

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:84%
of cleansing from
the outside rather

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:90%
than inside biologically?

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well,
OK, I guess I just

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
want to make a distinction
between laxatives

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:90%
and cleansing.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'm
kind of throwing

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.680 align:middle line:90%
the two in the same basket.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk laxatives and
not your annual cleansing,

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.610 align:middle line:84%
your spring
housecleaning, as it were.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, the laxatives
are just artificially softening

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.680 align:middle line:90%
the stool, pretty much.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there are lots
of residues that are left in--

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.840 align:middle line:84%
you can talk to
colon therapists,

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and they can tell you--

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
residues that are left
lining the intestines, which

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.407 align:middle line:84%
are basically fodder
for infections.

00:31:18.407 --> 00:31:20.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
malabsorption of nutrients?

00:31:20.115 --> 00:31:21.032 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Of course.

00:31:21.032 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you never want to
take laxatives and expect

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that you're not going to
have mineral or vitamin

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.980 align:middle line:90%
malabsorption.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.313 align:middle line:84%
You always want to
take extra nutrients

00:31:30.313 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:84%
when you're taking
that laxatives,

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:32.893 align:middle line:90%
because they're going to--

00:31:32.893 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:84%
they're just going to
help your body eliminate

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:35.790 align:middle line:90%
indiscriminately.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So does that feed
into leaky gut at all?

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, does
it feed into leaky gut?

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.925 align:middle line:90%
Well, I mean, it could.

00:31:44.925 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
It could, but it
doesn't have to.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm saying if you've
got all this stuff sticking

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.150 align:middle line:84%
around the lining of the
intestines, for example.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:53.068 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are you setting yourself
up for something chronic?

00:31:53.068 --> 00:31:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: You could be.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.950 align:middle line:90%
You could be, yeah.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Because eventually,
over time, the way I

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:84%
usually explain it if
something is irritating--

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.030 align:middle line:84%
or say you're rubbing your
finger on a piece of paper day

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.633 align:middle line:84%
after day, week after
week, month after month.

00:32:07.633 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you're going
to rub a hole in the paper.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And for things
that are irritating

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:84%
the intestinal lining, which
could be anything from gluten

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:21.032 align:middle line:84%
to infections, staph,
parasites, yeast, eventually,

00:32:21.032 --> 00:32:22.490 align:middle line:84%
what's going to
happen is there are

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.280 align:middle line:84%
going to be little tears
in the intestinal tract,

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and then stuff is going to
leak into the bloodstream

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.510 align:middle line:90%
before it's supposed to--

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:90%
protein, molecules, et cetera.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:90%
And then the body will attack.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.995 align:middle line:84%
This is really why we have a
lot of autoimmune problems.

00:32:34.995 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Autoimmune.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Right, autoimmune.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So going back to where we were,
this whole notion of serotonin

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and the production of
the feel-good chemicals

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.123 align:middle line:84%
which allow us to
relax and destress,

00:32:46.123 --> 00:32:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and if we can
destress, then we're

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
creating the right cascade,
I assume, of sex hormones

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:84%
What about-- you talked about
the meditation a little bit

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:59.960 align:middle line:84%
ago, but this razor's edge that
has to do with fun and pleasure

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.490 align:middle line:90%
and passion in life?

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:05.090 align:middle line:10%
How important is it that we
experience these feelings

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.160 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the kinds of
chemicals they create?

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And explain what
chemicals they do create

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and how they affect us.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, I mean,
fun and pleasure, of course.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just asking you
from a chemical point of view,

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, I think it
depends on what is causing--

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, I mean,
is it really fun?

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I tell you, I did--

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.553 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's why I'm asking.

00:33:26.553 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a razor's edge.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it's just seeking
some kind of intense experience

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.910 align:middle line:10%
that isn't necessarily
what we would call fun.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.585 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: I did--
this is on topic,

00:33:36.585 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:84%
but it might start sounding
like it's a little off topic.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go ahead.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: I did a great
experiment with myself

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.560 align:middle line:84%
when I went into menopause
about 12 years ago.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I had horrendous hot
flashes, 50 to 60 a day,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes full body
sweats, horrible-- two,

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.180 align:middle line:84%
three showers a day, waking
up 10 times at night,

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:84%
really not even wanting to
go anywhere near the bedroom

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:84%
because I started associating
it with horrendous discomfort.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I started to analyze
my hot flashes, because I mean,

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm a hormone expert.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So I can't be sitting
there having hot flashes.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I've worked
on myself, and I

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:84%
let other people work on
me, because that's really--

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.469 align:middle line:90%
physician, heal thyself, right?

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And I started analyzing
by thinking back.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, what just happened
10 seconds ago?

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:90%
What brought this hot flash on?

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Was it the iced
tea I just drank?

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Was it what somebody just said?

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And I started analyzing
how my reactions were

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.570 align:middle line:90%
to certain people.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.469 align:middle line:84%
There would invariably be a
patient or two or a person

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.260 align:middle line:84%
that I knew that would come
and sit down in front of me,

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and my face would
start dripping sweat.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think, what is it
about this person that I'm

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:84%
getting stressed out
about, whether it be fear

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:84%
or whatever emotion
was coming over me?

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see that even
joy could create a hot flash.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.440 align:middle line:10%
A hot flash is basically
the manifestation

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.260 align:middle line:10%
of a stressor, a
stress reaction.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.800 align:middle line:10%
And so I started seeing
all of these stimulants,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.510 align:middle line:10%
and I began to realize
that it wasn't just

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:10%
a hormone imbalance.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It was the brain.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It was what was
happening emotionally,

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
what was happening
brain chemical-wise.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I started getting

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.000 align:middle line:90%
into neurotransmitter work.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I began to
work on my serotonin--

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.430 align:middle line:84%
because my serotonin
was in the pits.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I started working
on serotonin levels.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't like
to think of working

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:44.070 align:middle line:84%
on anything biochemically
as a single action.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It's all about a balancing act.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the feedback
loop in the body, what

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:90%
responds to what.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the
ratios of serotonin

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.950 align:middle line:90%
to dopamine, for instance.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:84%
My hot flashes
started disappearing.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:90%
And I was an insomniac.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.720 align:middle line:90%
My sleep started improving.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I really had to
go that extra route

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and go beyond just the
hormone approach to working

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.710 align:middle line:90%
with the brain chemistry.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, it was
more about emotions,

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.925 align:middle line:90%
emotional stressors.

00:36:15.925 --> 00:36:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:10%
And also, I remember reading a
study a few years back talking

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.430 align:middle line:10%
about women in the Western
culture in particular--

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:27.030 align:middle line:10%
and I don't know if it was
isolated to the US or Western

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:10%
culture--

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.110 align:middle line:10%
that traditionally,
our levels of serotonin

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.360 align:middle line:10%
are lower than that of males.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.235 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know if you
found the same thing.

00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:36.235 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: That's true.

00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:38.040 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that
also, the balance

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:10%
of the alpha state
within our brains

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:43.883 align:middle line:10%
is something that is also
lower than with males.

00:36:43.883 --> 00:36:46.050 align:middle line:10%
So this seems to be this
thing you're talking about,

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:51.360 align:middle line:10%
this kind of mild depression,
having your emotions stressed

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.810 align:middle line:10%
more easily than a men,
for example, is very real

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:10%
on a chemical level.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it sounds like you
have to go to extra trouble

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:04.300 align:middle line:84%
to boost those levels in order
to get more up to a mainline.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Than a
man would have to.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah,
I think part of it

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is because women experience
more emotional stress.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:90%
That might not even be right.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
That might just be
a woman saying that.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.410 align:middle line:10%
That's why I was just
keeping it to brain chemicals

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.550 align:middle line:10%
and talking about
the alpha state.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think that women have
to pay particular attention

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:35.550 align:middle line:84%
to really getting spiritually or
emotionally, mentally balanced

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.292 align:middle line:90%
and keeping their guts strong.

00:37:38.292 --> 00:37:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Really, really
important, because I

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:84%
think women are
also more sort of

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:84%
attracted to the craving foods
and the coffee, the chocolate

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:90%
at 4:00 PM, that type of thing.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's not going to do it.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:54.200 align:middle line:90%
That's just the Band-Aid.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, you brought
this up earlier,

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:90%
and it's time to talk about it.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So if a person is thinking,
oh, I'm kind of like that.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy a lot of the time.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.400 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I don't know
what to do about it.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.600 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems
chemical, and they're

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.433 align:middle line:84%
having these thoughts
or feelings right now.

00:38:08.433 --> 00:38:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And you want to start
looking at it more seriously

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and evaluating it.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.232 align:middle line:84%
You have to do some
kind of testing.

00:38:14.232 --> 00:38:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go to
your HMO, they'll

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:90%
take a vial of blood or two.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Or not.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or not, or not.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.990 align:middle line:84%
If they take a vial of blood
or two, what's going on there?

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And then talk about,
in your opinion,

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.450 align:middle line:84%
what the preferred
manner of testing is.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Ideally,
I like for people

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to do both the saliva
hormone testing as well

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:84%
as the urinary
neurotransmitter testing.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that would be ideal.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.183 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason that some
people don't is because it

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:90%
gets costly to do everything.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:84%
The salivary testing I find
a lot more impactful to use

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
for a treatment
plan than bloodwork,

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.700 align:middle line:84%
mainly because the blood test--
first of all, it's a shot--

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:90%
it's a shot in the dark.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is--

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Testing the blood--

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.298 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that because
it's just that minute

00:38:58.298 --> 00:38:59.300 align:middle line:90%
versus over 24 hours?

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, yeah, because
the adrenal glands basically

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.570 align:middle line:90%
rule the 24-hour clock.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And so you really need to be
testing the adrenal hormones

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.650 align:middle line:84%
over a 24-hour period,
which you can't do at a lab.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what if you
were nearly in an accident

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.930 align:middle line:84%
before you arrived at
the lab, and you've

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of adrenal
response to that?

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get a
skewed reading even there.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: That's true.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or being
afraid of a needle, even.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Right, that's true.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:24.430 align:middle line:90%
So the bloodwork is helpful.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I always like to see them back
to back with the saliva test.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But if I had my choice, I would
have the 24-hour cortisol panel

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and the DHEA panel, the two
adrenal stress hormones,

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and the estrogen,
progesterone, and testosterone

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.380 align:middle line:90%
done through the saliva.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's done in the
convenience of your home

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:84%
because it's just a saliva
collection that you do at home.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's very simple.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple to perform.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And then a treatment plan
is made from the test.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:10%
And my focus is to help people,
obviously, feel better and be

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.990 align:middle line:10%
symptom free, but
really, more than that,

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:04.230 align:middle line:10%
my focus is to help
people not need anything,

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.540 align:middle line:10%
to get them to the point
where-- and it takes a while,

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:10%
because everybody has
a different timeline.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not going
to be a couple of weeks.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:84%
For most people, ti's going to
be about 18 months, actually.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:40:16.405 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Before they start seeing
long-term effects?

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: They'll start
feeling better more quickly.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you know,
when you're done,

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.700 align:middle line:90%
it usually takes a lot longer.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I like to
use the dietary approach.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.560 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before,
when people walk away

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and they're done with you, then
that's what they're left with.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they know how to
treat themselves with food.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I utilize certain
customized adrenal and female

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and male hormone precursor
creams, liposomal creams,

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.130 align:middle line:90%
that are made specifically.

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:84%
These are nonprescription,
by the way.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.422 align:middle line:90%
These are not compounded--

00:40:52.422 --> 00:40:53.630 align:middle line:90%
pharmacy compounded products.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, I was
wondering about that,

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:56.600 align:middle line:10%
because another route
that a lot of people

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.630 align:middle line:10%
take after they do their
panels is some practitioners

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:02.030 align:middle line:10%
or doctors or OBGYNs
will have people

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:10%
go on either
pharmaceutical hormones,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.428 align:middle line:10%
or they have them
go on bioidenticals.

00:41:06.428 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I've noticed
about the bioidenticals that

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.440 align:middle line:84%
are compounded is if you're not
under some pretty strict care

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.450 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being
tested regularly,

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.550 align:middle line:84%
you can throw your
hormones way out of balance

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:20.760 align:middle line:84%
quickly with bioidenticals, just
like pharmaceuticals, right?

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a bioidentical
choice is a better

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.190 align:middle line:84%
choice than the
pharmaceuticals, obviously,

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's better
quality, and it matches

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.490 align:middle line:90%
more what the body is making.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you take synthetic
estrogens, like Premarin,

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.090 align:middle line:84%
for instance, you've got 23
different estrogens that are

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.880 align:middle line:90%
available in the horse urine.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And the woman's body
has three estrogens.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.410 align:middle line:90%
So what happens to the other 20?

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.740 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons
there are so many, I think,

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.720 align:middle line:90%
hormonal cancers.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.577 align:middle line:90%
But anyway--

00:41:51.577 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you're
going to do one of the two,

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.422 align:middle line:84%
the bioidenticals
are a better choice.

00:41:55.422 --> 00:41:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Suzanne
Somers and all her work

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.960 align:middle line:90%
was about is that.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But I also know women who've
gotten in trouble with them.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Yes, because
they do have a tendency

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:90%
to be high potency.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.820 align:middle line:84%
The other problem with
them is that they are not

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.550 align:middle line:90%
transdermally liposomal.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not actually
produced in a way

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.250 align:middle line:84%
that they don't cause
buildup in the body.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the lab that I use,
they are aware of all that.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they have a
special liposomal method

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that they use where they
attach a phospholipid

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:30.800 align:middle line:84%
to the active ingredient, and
it creates 100 layer lipid--

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.160 align:middle line:84%
100 lipid layer which allows
it to get into the cell

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:84%
membrane and into
the bloodstream.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.057 align:middle line:90%
It bypasses the digestive tract.

00:42:38.057 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So there no
toxicity, essentially.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Right.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no buildup.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:90%
There's no buildup.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you say
this is over-the-counter?

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.790 align:middle line:10%
People can get these
over the counter?

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:47.195 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: Right.

00:42:47.195 --> 00:42:49.028 align:middle line:10%
Well, you have to go
through a practitioner,

00:42:49.028 --> 00:42:51.320 align:middle line:10%
but it doesn't have to be
a medical prescription.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, it's not
a medical procedure.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.247 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
kind of pharmacy

00:42:54.247 --> 00:42:56.240 align:middle line:84%
distributes these
or dispenses these?

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.210 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: There is a lab
in Carlsbad, California.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.190 align:middle line:90%
So you go through that lab?

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
do the testing,

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:06.368 align:middle line:84%
and then they actually custom
make the creams as well.

00:43:06.368 --> 00:43:08.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So if a woman is
listening to this right now,

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.000 align:middle line:10%
and she's out there
on her own, she's

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.040 align:middle line:10%
done with allopathic
medicine-- maybe

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:10%
she got burned by the
bioidentical thing

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:10%
and wants to give it a
try and maybe doesn't even

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.610 align:middle line:10%
have the funds to do the
full panels of testing

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.600 align:middle line:10%
and everything.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.200 align:middle line:90%
What does she do?

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: So the
first thing comes back

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:26.783 align:middle line:84%
to the information I
gave to the teenage girl

00:43:26.783 --> 00:43:28.700 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning of our
conversation, which is

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:90%
get the blood sugar imbalance.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of the wine every night.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.070 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't cut it.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of the chocolate.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And just do the due
diligence with diet.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Eat five small meals a day,
at least three proteins a day.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Drink half your body
weight in ounces in water.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.720 align:middle line:84%
If you're a 130-pound woman,
you drink about 2 quarts

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.460 align:middle line:90%
of water a day.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:10%
And have physical activity.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.380 align:middle line:10%
Do something, whether
it be yoga or walking

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.990 align:middle line:10%
or regular aerobic activity.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.990 align:middle line:10%
And do that which
brings you peace.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And happiness
and genuine joy,

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.700 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with
connectivity with others.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with oxytocin, right?

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.040 align:middle line:10%
From the time we're born
through the hugging process

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.490 align:middle line:10%
with other people, it produces
oxytocin, all of these things

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.120 align:middle line:10%
that have to do with community.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And before we get to
oxytocin, OK, what about-- can

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.390 align:middle line:84%
they go to-- can they
call this lab and say,

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.557 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to have some
of those hormone creams?

00:44:25.557 --> 00:44:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Can they do that, or do you
have to have a practitioner,

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:28.690 align:middle line:90%
as you said?

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: They
could call the lab,

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and the lab could probably
refer them to a practitioner.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.248 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And then
the practitioner

00:44:34.248 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:10%
could write up
something for them.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:37.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's not terribly expensive?

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.975 align:middle line:10%
I'm just trying to look
at someone taking it

00:44:39.975 --> 00:44:40.850 align:middle line:10%
into their own hands.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.308 align:middle line:10%
How could they do
this effectively?

00:44:42.308 --> 00:44:45.207 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: I think
a cream is about $70.

00:44:45.207 --> 00:44:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
long does that last?

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: It depends,
because in the beginning,

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.470 align:middle line:84%
it's usually a quarter of
a teaspoon, twice a day.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's about
a month's supply.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But like I said
before, the idea is

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.820 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen the body so
you need less and less.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.630 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I've been on
creams for 13, 14 years.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still using the same
cream I had seven months ago

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.540 align:middle line:90%
because I need less and less.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, very good point.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.508 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: So
yeah, at that point,

00:45:14.508 --> 00:45:15.930 align:middle line:90%
it's not expensive anymore.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I think most hormones
or brain chemical

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.290 align:middle line:84%
programs are more
expensive in the beginning

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:22.758 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a
front-loading thing.

00:45:22.758 --> 00:45:24.300 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay for
the practitioner.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay
for the lab costs.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.810 align:middle line:90%
And it is so worth it, though.

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:90%
When I say--

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.460 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But some people are just
so tired of systems,

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.810 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to
buy into anything.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.560 align:middle line:84%
They just want to take
care of themselves.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking on behalf
of any of our viewers

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that are feeling
that way about it.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: I'm hip
because I tend to--

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.893 align:middle line:84%
I tend to attract
maybe people like me--

00:45:46.893 --> 00:45:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and like me.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.602 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: --who
don't want systems.

00:45:49.602 --> 00:45:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: And I get
that question a lot.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I will handle
that person in the way

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.970 align:middle line:84%
they need to be handled,
which means that it's

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.920 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more hands-off.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And I get to get them
to a maintenance point

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:84%
more quickly, and
probably because they

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.850 align:middle line:84%
don't need the hands-on that a
lot of the other people need.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at something
that is actually still pretty

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.590 align:middle line:90%
affordable--

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.132 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we can
go down that route.

00:46:15.132 --> 00:46:16.080 align:middle line:10%
But I get you.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.060 align:middle line:84%
If you can get the nice
saliva panels going first,

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.280 align:middle line:90%
that's a good thing.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.120 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about community and
now this last really healing

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.470 align:middle line:84%
part of it all, which is
the notion of isolation

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.630 align:middle line:84%
within society, people
feeling like they're

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.750 align:middle line:84%
having to carry it all on
their own, men and women both,

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and the production of
oxytocin and the need

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.600 align:middle line:84%
for that kind of
connection with each other,

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.870 align:middle line:90%
even into a spiritual level.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Well, it's
definitely something

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that we see a lot
now, that I see

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.640 align:middle line:84%
in the different
types of, I would say,

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.280 align:middle line:84%
esoteric testing that
I do in my practice

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.230 align:middle line:84%
where I do certain types
of biofeedback testing

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:01.050 align:middle line:84%
which are not medical,
clinical tests.

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But certain things are
revealed in the testing that

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:14.560 align:middle line:84%
shows that people are definitely
feeling separate and cut off.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And I hear people talking
about it all the time.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not any news.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:26.070 align:middle line:10%
But to me, I'll just
tell you what I do.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:29.010 align:middle line:10%
I utilize certain
homeopathics that

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.520 align:middle line:10%
help with the oxytocin
production, which

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.010 align:middle line:10%
have to do with the pituitary
gland and the hypothalamus

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:38.160 align:middle line:10%
in the brain, these
glands that stimulate,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.580 align:middle line:10%
really, the whole cascade
of hormones in my body.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that will
just do it right there.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's not
just a question of that

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:56.790 align:middle line:84%
we are separated and isolated,
but it's that we feel that.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing wrong
with being alone, and there's

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.440 align:middle line:84%
nothing wrong with not
being in community.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's just, how does
that make you feel?

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.522 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: Because some people
feel great being like that.

00:48:09.522 --> 00:48:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So those people
wouldn't be needing

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.690 align:middle line:90%
the oxytocin is my point.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get a
cascade of hormones

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:20.340 align:middle line:90%
going to help a person--

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.410 align:middle line:84%
maybe they're actually
retreating, you know?

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:27.090 align:middle line:84%
It may not just be that
they're victims, per se,

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:32.520 align:middle line:84%
but maybe there is something
in their spiritual makeup

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that is saying, hey, you need
to kick back a little bit,

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:39.450 align:middle line:84%
get yourself centered and
healed, and then go back

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:40.993 align:middle line:90%
and create a better community.

00:48:40.993 --> 00:48:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
that makes perfect sense.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.368 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's such a thing
as just being overly dependent

00:48:45.368 --> 00:48:48.300 align:middle line:10%
and having to need to be in
contact because it's your--

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.130 align:middle line:10%
somehow your buoy in life.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not suggesting that.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.430 align:middle line:84%
More this kind of general
feeling of the burden

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that life carries because
of all the stimuli,

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.760 align:middle line:84%
the input, the responsibilities,
the bills going out

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.560 align:middle line:90%
every month.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are all
artificial constructs.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not part of
necessarily being a human.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And we are adapting,
but this whole notion

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:10.740 align:middle line:84%
of needing each other
maybe a little more than we

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.600 align:middle line:90%
give ourselves credit for also.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of what occurs
is because there's so much--

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:23.040 align:middle line:84%
so much overwhelm and so
much overuse of the brain,

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that the brain chemistry
just sets itself up for that.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, you
can turn that around.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.490 align:middle line:84%
You can turn that around
by giving the nutrients

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:33.995 align:middle line:90%
to the brain chemicals.

00:49:33.995 --> 00:49:35.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there are certain

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:37.840 align:middle line:84%
customized amino acid
powders, for instance,

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:42.870 align:middle line:84%
that you can use for brain
chemical balancing that

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:45.067 align:middle line:84%
could actually create
a different reality.

00:49:45.067 --> 00:49:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So from
your point of view--

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.060 align:middle line:84%
we only have a
minute or so left.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.130 align:middle line:84%
From your point of
view, really, there's

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:54.420 align:middle line:84%
very little that most human
beings can't balance out

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.340 align:middle line:84%
in the natural realm of--
as you say, whether it's

00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.420 align:middle line:84%
a natural amino acid powder,
whether it's food, whether it's

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.450 align:middle line:84%
having fun, and whether
it's meditating and having

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.950 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual practice, we
can balance ourselves out.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:09.240 align:middle line:84%
We do not have to turn our
power in this way over,

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.370 align:middle line:90%
necessarily, to an industry.

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.170 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: We need to.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:13.980 align:middle line:90%
We need to.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are on our own.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: We have to do it.

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:90%
We have to do it.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.333 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Final comment on that?

00:50:17.333 --> 00:50:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMPSON: We have to do it for
the whole world of epigenetics

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and how we eat and how we
behave and how nourished we are

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and how that turns
into gene expression

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and how that gets passed
along to our children.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we need
to heal ourselves.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.650 align:middle line:84%
We need to-- I keep
saying due diligence,

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:40.220 align:middle line:84%
but we need to do
our due diligence

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to get our bodies balanced in
whatever way that is so that we

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.963 align:middle line:90%
can create a beautiful future.

00:50:47.963 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can't throw
Band-Aids at it anymore.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: No.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.412 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It feels like the
time for throwing Band-Aids

00:50:52.412 --> 00:50:53.550 align:middle line:90%
and a pill at it is over.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: That's true.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty much.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: That's true.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if people want
to get hold of you, I'm sure--

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:02.120 align:middle line:84%
you're a naturopath and
naturopathic endocrinologist,

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.720 align:middle line:84%
which is a fairly rare
and very specified field.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But other than reaching
you, are there other people

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.932 align:middle line:84%
that they might go to, whether
it's homeopothist or whatnot?

00:51:11.932 --> 00:51:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Well, sure.

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:14.948 align:middle line:10%
People should go to whoever
they-- you know, to--

00:51:14.948 --> 00:51:17.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Homeopathy is a good
place to begin for one, right?

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:20.120 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMPSON: Well,
I mean, whatever

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.020 align:middle line:10%
appeals to the person
who's finding a person.

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Homeopaths are not
necessarily going

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.440 align:middle line:84%
to be hormone balancers, but
nothing wrong with homeopathy.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It might be a path to
balancing the brain chemicals,

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.340 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm just saying,
there are many paths,

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.283 align:middle line:10%
because not everybody can
end up on your doorstep.

00:51:38.283 --> 00:51:39.083 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:51:39.083 --> 00:51:40.130 align:middle line:90%
There are chiropractors.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.172 align:middle line:90%
There are acupuncturists.

00:51:41.172 --> 00:51:42.170 align:middle line:90%
There are herbalists.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I just thought I'd
toss that out there

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.490 align:middle line:84%
because I know a
lot of people are

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:48.590 align:middle line:84%
going to want to try to
connect with you after this.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:50.423 align:middle line:84%
And I really thank you
for your time, Laura.

00:51:50.423 --> 00:51:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I hope this has offered
some deeper insights

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:56.630 align:middle line:84%
into how our bodies handle
external and internal stress

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.940 align:middle line:84%
where hormone
production is concerned.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know that all
roads keep leading back

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to a life oriented
more toward peace.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.720 align:middle line:10%
If our external world is not
supporting a more peaceful

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.060 align:middle line:10%
lifestyle, is what I'm
hearing you say, then perhaps

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:10.040 align:middle line:10%
changes are in order
across the board.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.730 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
