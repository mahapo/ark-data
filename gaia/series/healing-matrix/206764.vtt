00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you imagine watching
your 16-year-old child die

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:10%
of a heart attack after
having a routine root canal?

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what happened to
pioneer dentist, Weston Price,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and why you need to think twice
before you or your loved one

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:90%
considers getting a root canal.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Joining us again is biological
dentist, Dr. Blanche Grube,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
who will tell us more
about the dangers

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
of this common procedure,
the root canal.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
here, Dr. Blanche.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much, Dr. Ed.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So what exactly
is the root canal?

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:84%
We have some images
here on the screen

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:90%
we'd like you to go through.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, before we
talk about the root canal,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
we have to talk
about the cavity.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:10%
Because most root
canals are, quote,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:10%
necessary by dentists when
there is decay, and the decay

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:10%
is so large and
so deep that it's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:10%
into the nerve of the tooth.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's back up a
little bit and talk

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:90%
about cavities, all right?

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:10%
When you have bacterial
colonies forming

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:10%
on the surface of
a tooth, they begin

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.663 align:middle line:10%
to travel through the
enamel into the next layer

00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:10%
of the tooth which
is called the dentin.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:10%
You can see that on
our picture here.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:10%
The dentin is a little bit
softer than the enamel.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So the bacteria like
it, it's easier to eat,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and then as they start heading
further down into the tooth,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
they head towards the
pulp of the tooth which

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:90%
is where the blood vessels are.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:10%
You have your arteries, your
veins, even some lymphatics,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:10%
a few white blood cells are
in the pulp of the tooth.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria like that just
like they like the heart.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:84%
They like places
where it's warm,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:90%
and there's lots of free food.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So when a dentist
looks at an x-ray,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
if they see decay on the
enamel surface of the tooth,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:84%
very often, they will call
that incipient decay or just

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
beginning decay and tell
the patient to floss it.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:90%
We'll keep an eye on it.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Seldom will they say,
yes, we have to fill this.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We were taught in dental
school that you only

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
say it's a cavity when that
decay is through the enamel

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.998 align:middle line:90%
and into the dentin.

00:02:25.998 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a very
interesting thing

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
because if you take a look at
the work of Weston Price back

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in the 1920s and 1930s, Dr.
Price proved with a microscope

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that if the decay is halfway
the distance from the surface

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:84%
of the enamel to the pulp,
halfway the distance,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:90%
that pulp is already infected.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, wow, halfway between
the enamel and the pulp,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
well, that's the
dentin, which means

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that when most dentists
diagnose a cavity,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that pulp in that tooth
is already infected.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And if it's infected, it's
almost impossible for the body

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of that infection.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why,
but God made teeth

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
different from the
rest of the body.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Ed, if you were to
cut your arm right now,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
you know that there's
enough circulation

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
in your arm for the
white blood cells

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
to come, eat up whatever
bacteria are in that cut,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
add some more fibrous
tissue, and before you

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
know it, within two
weeks, the cut is gone,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:90%
and you have perfect skin again.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's true of
most of the body.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
If you injure yourself,
we expect it to heal.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
happen with teeth.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that when
we get a cavity,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and it enters through the enamel
into the dentin into the pulp,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:90%
it never heals?

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough
circulation in a tooth.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
The white blood cells cannot
fit into that teeny little hole

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of a
tooth, rush up in there,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
clean up the bacteria,
and lay down new tooth.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It simply doesn't
happen, which I

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
can't help believing that it
was never God's intention for us

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:84%
to eat the amount of sugar
that we eat these days.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
If you look at cavemen,
cavemen did not

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
have the number of cavities
that we have today.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
eat the amount of sugar

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:90%
that we eat today.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I grew up in
Brooklyn, New York.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a candy
store on every corner.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you got a dime,
you ran to the candy store

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and bought a little,
brown bag full of candy.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Kids today don't even have
to run to the candy store.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Their mothers go to
the grocery aisle.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what civilization
has an aisle full of candy?

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Everything from chocolates to
sucking candies to bubblegum,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and the parents buy
these bags by the pound.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:10%
Once the decay is into the
pulp, if there's a lot of decay,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:10%
the patient will know it because
they'll have sensitivity.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:10%
The tooth will hurt, and then
the dentist might look at this,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:10%
and after the bacteria
have eaten up the pulp,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:10%
and have eaten up
everything down the canal,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:10%
well, then remember I
said before, bacteria

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:10%
produce piss and poop, toxins,
and they also produce gas.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
The gas at the end
of the root begins

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:90%
to put pressure on the bone.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:10%
When that happens,
the bone dissolves.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:10%
If I was to put my nail
and press on my arm here,

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:10%
and if I left my
nail and my finger

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:10%
on my arm for about two
months, when I took it off

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:10%
there would be an
indentation in my bone

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:10%
because I've put pressure on it.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same thing
happens in the mouth.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Those gases put
pressure on the bone,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and then when the dentist
looks at the x-ray,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
the dentist will say
you have an infection,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
or you have an abscess,
which is not 100% true,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:90%
but it's good enough.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
What the dentist is actually
looking at is lack of bone

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
produced by the gases produced
by the microorganisms that

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
have already eaten up the
pulp and have eaten up all

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:90%
of the tissue in the canal.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.920 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the dentist
says to the patient,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:90%
you need a root canal.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We can see on the X-ray
here, can you explain?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this is a tooth
that has had a root canal.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:90%
So you can see this is a molar.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:90%
It's an upper molar.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
The upper molar has
three canals mostly.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It also has lots of sideways
canals, what we call

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:90%
in dentistry accessory canals.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, it has
three major canals.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So the dentist had taken
the middle of that tooth,

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
drilled a hole, and cleaned
out the middle canal.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Then the dentist went ahead and
cleaned out of that side canal,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and then cleaned out the
other side canal that goes

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:90%
towards the back.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.260 align:middle line:84%
When the dentist thought that
that major canal was filled

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and cleaned well
enough, then they

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
fill it with the rubbery
material gutta-percha.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Some people say gutta-percha.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it's a pink, rubbery
material off a Malaysian tree

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:90%
called gutta-percha.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:10%
He mixes that
gutta-percha with cement

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.200 align:middle line:10%
and then fills it
up into the canal.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:10%
What is the dentist
thinking at that point?

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:10%
What's their intention?

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:10%
They actually believe that
they have sterilized the tooth.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:90%
That's their first false belief.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And then secondly, they
believe that they're

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:84%
sealing the tooth by filling
it with gutta-percha.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of those
things are true.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.782 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not true.

00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And just to recap, when
you were talking about all

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
the sugar, we're talking about
refined, man-made, toxic sugar.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>> The white stuff.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Not God's sugar that you're
going to find in fresh fruits

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and different types
of natural products.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.562 align:middle line:84%
>> You can take a machete and
cut off a piece of sugar cane

00:08:02.562 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and suck on it all day long,
and it's not going to give you

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:90%
decay.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Because that raw sugar cane
is also loaded with minerals.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Sugar tends to eat up
minerals in our body.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you're having raw
sugar, raw sugar cane,

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
you're providing your body
with those same minerals again.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't get decay.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> At the beginning of the show,
we talked about Weston Price,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and the root canals
that he was doing.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you elaborate on his son,
and the death of his son?

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:90%
What exactly happened?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, obviously, his son
must have either had candy,

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:84%
had sugar, or perhaps he
was in a traumatic accident,

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and somebody punched
him in the face.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:90%
You can kill a tooth that way.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
You can break a tooth by
crunching on a piece of ice.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's two ways
of killing a tooth.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Not just sugar.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:84%
You can also kill it with
some kind of traumatic event.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
That must be what happened
to Weston Price's son.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.170 align:middle line:90%
By the way, his name was Donald.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So then Weston-- what
most people don't know

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
is that Weston Price himself did
the root canal on his own son.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:10%
And so when his son died of a
heart attack one week later,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:10%
he made the connection.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.820 align:middle line:84%
How many people would
make the connection?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Most people would be
just filled with grief,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
but he made the connection
and thought perhaps

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:84%
there's something in
the root canal that

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:84%
caused my 16-year-old son
to die of a heart attack.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
fascinates me even more.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
He actually extracted the
tooth from his son's body

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.380 align:middle line:84%
before he buried his son,
and then he took that tooth

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the
ear of a rabbit,

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and the rabbit died of a
heart attack within 24 hours.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, being a true
scientist, a true scientist

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
knows they have to repeat
the experiment over

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and over and over to
get clarification.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.350 align:middle line:84%
He took that same
tooth and put it

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
in the ear of another
rabbit, and that rabbit

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
died of a heart attack
within 24 hours.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:90%
He did 200 rabbits.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:84%
All 200 rabbits died of a
heart attack within 24 hours.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>> That's pretty convincing
evidence that the root canal

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:90%
has something to do--

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Had something to do
with the heart attack.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Then he began to
look at patients

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
who had serious disorders,
serious diseases,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:90%
and they had root canals.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
He would extract
their root canal

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the
ear of a rabbit.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the patient
had diabetes,

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:90%
the rabbit developed diabetes.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.910 align:middle line:84%
If the patient had
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the rabbit would develop
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and so he knew there was
definitely a connection,

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and he knew that the rabbit
died of the same disease

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:90%
the patient had.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the patient must
have had a weak genetic link

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
with whatever organ it
was, and so something

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:84%
was attacking their
weak genetic link

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and causing that disease
to manifest itself.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
At that time, he didn't know
what that something was.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it
wasn't until years

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
later that a fellow by
the name of Josef Issols

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:84%
was able to let us know that
there are chemicals produced

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
by the microorganisms in
the bacteria in root canals

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:90%
that caused the problem.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, wow, I mean, the trauma
that he probably went through

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
knowing that he gave his
own son the root canal,

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
but then being able to make that
connection and find out that it

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
actually was the root canal that
caused his son's death and then

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
think about how many people
have been saved since those

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:90%
findings.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> He dedicated the rest of his
life to studying root canals,

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and he had a group of
scientists working with him.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just Weston Price.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just
one mad scientist.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
No, he had people like
Charles Mayo, the Mayo Clinic.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.805 align:middle line:90%
Edward Rosenow.

00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Vaughn was the president
of the American Medical

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Association.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the scientists
working with Weston Price.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So this was not some
sleazy, little team

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:90%
of crazy scientists.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
These were the leading
scientists and doctors

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
of the day, and they
all knew that there

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:84%
was something terribly
wrong with root canals.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And Rosenow was the
first one to say,

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
we have got to stop
doing root canals.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's a pretty amazing
and shocking and sad story

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about Dr. Huggins
research on root canals.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, let me back up
a little bit and give you

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
interesting history.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Before Weston price passed
away, he had given a trunk--

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
you know the old-fashioned trunk
that we used to take to camp?

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:84%
He had given a trunk full
of his latest research

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
to a friend of his
and asked his friend

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
to give it to somebody who he
knew would carry on his work.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have
anybody at that time.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
His friend held on to that
trunk until he reached old age,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and then his friend
went to a lecture

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.050 align:middle line:84%
where Dr. Huggins was
talking about nutrition

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and how nutrition affected
periodontal disease

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:90%
and the health of the body.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And the gentleman-- I don't know
his name-- but the gentleman

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
said, this is who I'm
going to give the trunk to.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:84%
He literally went straight to
his house, knocked on the door,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and said here, this is for you.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.533 align:middle line:90%
And so Weston Price's work was--

00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how you say it.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't know
each other physically,

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
but it was transmitted
to Hal Huggins,

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and he inherited all of the
research from Dr. Weston Price.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So years later, Dr.
Huggins was still

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
battling with the
question of what

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:84%
is it in a root canal tooth
that makes the person sick?

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
What is it that causes
disease in a root canal tooth?

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:84%
We knew they were
toxins being produced,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and not everybody knew
exactly what those toxins are.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do know
what the toxins are,

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't even know
the names of the bacteria

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
until Dr. Huggins went to
the University of Colorado

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.682 align:middle line:90%
to get master's in immunology.

00:14:36.682 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:10%
And while he was at the
University of Colorado,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:10%
he learned about
DNA, and how you

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:10%
could extract the DNA
of a microorganism

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:10%
and look at the DNA bank that we
have here in the United States.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Now the whole world uses
GenBank where they have actually

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
been able to not only
lay out the genetic print

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:90%
for the human genome--

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.968 align:middle line:90%
you know about that--

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:84%
but they've also laid
out the genetic print

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:84%
for almost every microorganism
in every plant on the planet.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Huggins began looking at
the DNA of the microorganisms

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
in root canal, and
that's how we came along

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
with the laboratory, which at
first was called dental DNA.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at
the microorganisms

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.830 align:middle line:84%
in root canals and gum
disease, and then DNA

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
was doing very well.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at all
these microorganisms.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:84%
One day, Dr. Blanche Grube,
myself, I sent a root canal

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.240 align:middle line:84%
tooth from one of my
patients had the laboratory

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado Springs.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later,
everybody calls me up.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:90%
They're all excited.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.920 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on?

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
They said, Dr. Grube,
did you know that we

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:90%
found Borrelia burgdorferi.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the microorganism
that causes Lyme Disease.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
We found Borrelia burgdorferi
in one of the root canals

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:90%
that you sent us.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
How did the microorganism
that caused Lyme disease

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
get inside of a
root canal tooth,

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and how did it stay
there and multiply

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.420 align:middle line:84%
enough to make the patient
sick with Lyme disease

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and for us to be able to
detect it in the laboratory?

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just an incredible
path of coincidences?

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying that Dr.
Huggins had this information

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know about the
rabbit study or any of that

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:90%
until he opened up the box?

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Until he opened the box.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And he opened the box simply
because somebody else asked him

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
if he was familiar with
the work of Weston Price.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly the light
went off in his head,

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and he said, where have
I heard that name before?

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, the box.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
started studying,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and one of the first books
that Dr. Huggins wrote

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:90%
was called The Price--

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
meaning Weston Price, "The
Price of Root Canals".

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, let's take a look.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:10%
Here's Dr. Huggins
speaking on root canals.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:10%
>> What we did was we'd take out
a root canal tooth because we

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:10%
were finding that the root
canal tooth would seem to be

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:10%
an initiating or at least a
contributing factor to a lot

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.800 align:middle line:10%
of the diseases of,
quote, "unknown origin".

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:10%
Unknown etiology, in other
words, where is it coming from.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:10%


00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:10%
And so if we take these
teeth out and examine

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:10%
the root, the bottom
third down here,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:10%
we found a whole
lot of bacteria,

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:10%
and these are kind of
dangerous bacteria.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.750 align:middle line:10%
And then a year or
two later, I decided

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:10%
if the bacteria really
coming through those

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:10%
tubules to the
periodontal ligament, what

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:10%
does the ligament contain?

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:10%
So we would cut off the
ligament and test that,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:10%
and we found more
bacteria in the ligament.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, you can't get to
that to sterilize it

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:10%
without taking the tooth out.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:10%
And then about 10
years later, I got

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.460 align:middle line:10%
the idea, what do you suppose
is going on in the bone

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:10%
outside of the tooth?

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:10%
So we take the tooth
out, and then you

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:10%
have to use a dental bur
to cut out the ligament.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:28.450 align:middle line:10%
A lot of dentists will
just try to scrape it out

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:10%
with a little instrument that
scrapes, and what that does

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:10%
is to push the bacteria into
the bone into the bloodstream.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:10%
So if you do that, people
get a whole lot sicker.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:10%
All right, so we take the
tooth out, take a bur,

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:10%
cut out the
periodontal ligament,

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:10%
let it bleed for a little bit,
and then take the blood sample

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:10%
We found a whole
lot more bacteria.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:10%
So sterilizing the
tooth is something

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:10%
that is not only impossible,
but it can't be done.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Sounds like there's a lot
of dangers involved with root

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.345 align:middle line:90%
canals.

00:19:05.345 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
What have you seen, or what
are your comments on that?

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, for me,
the most important patient

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:90%
in the whole world was myself.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I had five root canal
teeth, and I had cancer.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I had chronic
myeloblastic leukemia.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I had my root canal
teeth removed,

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.508 align:middle line:84%
and my leukemia disappeared
literally overnight.

00:19:25.508 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that says
something, and I've

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
seen many, many patients
who have root canals

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:90%
and have problems.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there
are a lot of people

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
who are going to be watching
this show who are going to say,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
well, just because there's
an association, doesn't mean

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:90%
it's cause and effect.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:90%
And so yes, I agree with you.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always
mean cause and effect,

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
but you can't help but get
suspicious when I literally

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
have thousands of
patients coming

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
through my office in the
last 28 years with cancer.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And every single one of them
has a root canal or cavitation,

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:90%
which we'll talk about later.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Every single one.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:84%
There has to be some kind of
association between the two.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it just the procedure
that's dangerous that

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:90%
conventional dentists are using?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's not
just the procedure.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:10%
It actually, literally doesn't
matter what kind of procedure

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:10%
they do.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter if they
do a conventional root

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.680 align:middle line:10%
canal with gutta-percha
and toxic cements.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if they do
a so-called biological root

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:90%
canal.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
There's some holistic
dentists out there

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that advertise they
do a biological root

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.495 align:middle line:90%
canal with calcium hydroxide.

00:20:32.495 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, those root canals
have shown themselves

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to be just as toxic
if not more toxic

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
than the conventional
root canals.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's not the procedure.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not how the
root canal is done.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that you cannot
keep the tooth sterile after

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:90%
the root canal is done.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So the longer the root canal is
in the mouth, the more toxins

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
you have, the more
bacteria you have,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:90%
but bacteria produce toxins.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It's literally that
simple, and those toxins

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:84%
are toxins that the body
is not able to metabolize.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:84%
There's one called
dimethyl sulfate.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Dimethyl sulfate comes
out of a root canal tooth

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and embeds itself into the
tissue that is not cells,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:90%
not blood vessels, not nerves.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
What we call the
mesenchymal tissue.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Some people confuse it and say
it's the connective tissue.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Some people say it's
the ground substance.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:84%
It's everything
that's not a cell.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:90%
It sits in that area.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:90%
It accumulates in that area.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:90%
The body cannot metabolize it.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that released
by a pathogen?

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's released by the
microorganisms inside the root

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:90%
canal tooth.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We were not able to know what
were those microorganisms.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't tell because
they were all anaerobic,

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
meaning they were non
air breathing bacteria.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So the minute you
took the tooth out,

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're now in a room full of
oxygen, the bacteria would die.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't culture them.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.860 align:middle line:84%
There was no way
to tell what were

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
the microorganisms
in root canal teeth

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.100 align:middle line:90%
that were causing the problem.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't do it because
they were mostly anaerobic,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:90%
non air breathing bacteria.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But then when Dr.
Huggins discovered,

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:90%
well, wait a minute.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.923 align:middle line:90%
We can look at the DNA.

00:22:19.923 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
at the DNA, it

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.970 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter if it's an
aerobic bacteria or anaerobic.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:90%
The DNA is the DNA.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there a group of certain,
very common pathogens that you

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:84%
see in the majority of
time or does it matter?

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there are certain
pathogens that we see

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:84%
consistently in a lot
of the root canals,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:90%
and they are the bad boys.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:90%
They're the non air breathing--

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:84%
E coli, everybody
knows what that is.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Botuli, everybody
knows what that is.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:84%
We didn't always expect to
see Borrelia burgdorferi.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:84%
The bacteria that
cause Lyme disease,

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:84%
but we've actually
seen bacteria that

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
cause every disease
that you can possibly

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
imagine inside the root
canal so which comes first?

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
The disease or the root canal?

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we actually have some
photos of root canals so if you

00:23:13.293 --> 00:23:14.960 align:middle line:84%
could talk us through
a couple of these,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
we would appreciate it.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so this is not for
the weak-stomached people.

00:23:21.038 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:84%
You may want to get the
children out of the room.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about that
one on the left there.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The one on the left is a
tooth that had root canal,

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the orange
material is that gutta-percha

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
or gutta-percha, that rubbery
material that I told you about.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So the dentist heated
up the gutta-percha,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:84%
made the rubber get
soft so that it would

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:90%
fill the inside of the canal.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, when the rubber
cools down, it contracts.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
All rubbers contract
when they cool down.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And so once it cooled
down, then the bacteria

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.150 align:middle line:84%
had lots of space, lots
of room to move around.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the main blood
vessels are destroyed

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:84%
going into a tooth when
a root canal is done.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So the tooth becomes
more brittle with time.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So after you've had
a root canal done,

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:84%
the dentist will
tell you that you now

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:12.070 align:middle line:84%
need to have a post, which is a
piece of metal that is screwed

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
into the large
canal, and then you

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
have to have a tooth, a
crown, put on top of it.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.317 align:middle line:84%
So this tooth had-- you can
see-- it had a root canal.

00:24:20.317 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:90%
You can see it had a post.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if you can see
it clearly in this picture.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
You see that piece of metal
that is sticking right down.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the post.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it had a metal
crown put on top of it,

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and this looks to me like it's
probably a porcelain fused

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.123 align:middle line:90%
to metal crown.

00:24:36.123 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So what type of metal
is that that they're using?

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's called porcelain
fused to who knows what

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
in my office because Dr. Huggins
began to research what was

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
the metal underneath these
porcelain fused to metal

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:90%
crowns.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And so he called up the
maker of the ingots,

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and the maker of
the ingots told him,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.470 align:middle line:84%
well, you have to go
call up these people who

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:90%
make the crowns.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So he called up the people
who make the crowns,

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and they said to
him, well, you have

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to call up the people
who make the ingots,

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and he kept going back
and forth, back and forth,

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:84%
until finally, I think he
was able to grab somebody

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
by the throat and
say, listen, I want

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
to know where does the metal
come from for these crowns.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And somebody actually
did give him an address,

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and he decided to
get in his car,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and he was going to
research it out himself,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and he kept driving and
driving and driving.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Until suddenly, he became
a little bit confused

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
because he was in the
middle of no man's land,

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing he could see
in front of him was a junkyard.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Complete with junkyard
dogs barking and yelling.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And so he went into the
junkyard, and he said,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:50.010 align:middle line:84%
could you please tell me where
these ingots for dental crowns

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:90%
are made?

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And a fellow with a
cigar in his mouth

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:90%
said, yeah, go in the back.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a lab in the back, and
he walked around to the back,

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and there was this huge
pile of car bumpers.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm old enough.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
My first car was a
Chevy, and my Chevy

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:90%
had an aluminum car bumper.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a mixture of aluminum,
and some other kinds of metals.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, the car bumpers
are made out of plastic.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, they weren't
always like that.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.750 align:middle line:84%
They used to be
made out of metal,

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and so here was this laboratory.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:84%
They were literally
melting car bumpers

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and turning them into
cute little ingots

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:84%
for the dental industry,
and Dr. Huggins was shocked.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And since then, we always
called it porcelain

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.837 align:middle line:90%
fused to car bumper.

00:26:35.837 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have patients
who will say to me

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
but, no, doctor, my crown
is porcelain fused to gold.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's no such thing as
pure gold in dentistry anymore.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, we used
to do gold foil.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:90%
That was 24-karat gold.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Not anymore.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Gold has to have other
materials added to it,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise,
it's too soft.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:90%
So they add silver.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:90%
They add copper.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.830 align:middle line:90%
They add nickel to make it hard.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.020 align:middle line:84%
They add copper to
make it look like gold.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.388 align:middle line:84%
So there's no such thing
as pure gold anymore.

00:27:11.388 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody says,
oh, I have porcelain

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.700 align:middle line:84%
fused to gold crown, I
give a little chuckle,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and say, yeah, not really.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's your
typical root canal,

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and if you take a look
carefully at that picture,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice how
black and dark it

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:84%
is in the middle of
those three roots.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the area
where in this tooth

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.590 align:middle line:84%
the microorganisms
were producing the most

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.563 align:middle line:90%
number of -thyl ethers.

00:27:36.563 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Those are the chemicals
that I was telling you

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.670 align:middle line:90%
about like dimethyl sulfate.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Dimethyl sulfate
is a -thyl ether.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So until somebody
can figure out how

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:84%
to sterilize that tooth in
the mouth and keep it sterile,

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
then I will still
continue telling people

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that they should not
have a root canal.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And if they have a root canal,
have it extracted, and have it

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:90%
extracted the right way.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, what about this one?

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so this is a root canal
tooth where the bacteria had

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:84%
already finished eating up
the inside of the tooth,

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and so now, they were producing
those gases and making

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.620 align:middle line:84%
an abscess at the
end of the tooth.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And so now at this
point, this is

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.080 align:middle line:84%
when the tooth is most toxic
because the toxins are entering

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:90%
directly into the bloodstream.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, the tooth is a
very interesting organ.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Half of the tooth is outside,
or one third of the tooth

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:90%
is outside the mouth.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The mouth is actually
outside the body,

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and the other 2/3 of the
tooth is inside the body.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually two separate
kinds of tissue in the body.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I very often tell patients,
picture a balloon.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And if I was to take my finger
and press inside a balloon

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and push it all
the way to the end,

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:84%
is my finger inside
the balloon or is

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:90%
my finger outside the balloon?

00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Outside the balloon.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Correct, very good, and I
hadn't rehearsed you for this

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.800 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Your finger is
outside the balloon.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the egg and
the sperm come together

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and make one cell, that
cell divides in half.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have two cells,
and those cells divide.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have got four cells.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And those cells divide,
and they continue dividing

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.350 align:middle line:90%
until we have a ball of cells.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:90%
That's called the blastomere.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And then somewhere in
this whole process,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
God-given process, the
outside of the ball indurates,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.290 align:middle line:84%
just like I did with the balloon
and my finger as we imagined.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It indurates and goes
through that ball of cells.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:84%
This part of that ball
of cells is the mouth.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:84%
This part of that ball
of cells is the anus.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So from the mouth
to the anus, we're

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:90%
actually outside the body.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So you recommend everybody
get their root canals removed,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.430 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, only if you want
to live a long, healthy life.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:84%
If you don't care, then
keep your root canal.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So what exactly is involved
in a safe root canal removal?

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad you
asked that question.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:84%
The very first thing
the patient must

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.250 align:middle line:90%
have is IV vitamin C on board.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:90%
So why do I say that?

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Because no matter
what the dentist does,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:84%
no matter how gentle
the dentist is,

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.820 align:middle line:84%
when you take a pair
of forceps, and you

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.670 align:middle line:84%
begin to rock a
root canal tooth,

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:84%
all those toxins that
Dr. Huggins talked

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.420 align:middle line:84%
about that travel from the tooth
to the periodontal ligament

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.148 align:middle line:84%
to the bone are now entering
into the circulation.

00:30:46.148 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And you prep the
patient for this, like,

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.270 align:middle line:90%
the whole procedure.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:50.070 align:middle line:90%
They're down.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.360 align:middle line:90%
You've talked to them before.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You're doing the vitamin C,
and you're letting them know

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.280 align:middle line:84%
exactly how the process
is going to work.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> They get vitamin
C on board first,

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:03.270 align:middle line:84%
then when we take out the root
canal, we do exactly as Dr.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Huggins taught.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:84%
We remove the ligament that
held the tooth to the bone,

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and we remove another millimeter
to sometimes two millimeters

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:90%
of bone.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you do DNA testing as
well before the root canal is

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.820 align:middle line:90%
removed or--

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> If the patient requests it.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, we
just do the DNA testing

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.210 align:middle line:90%
after the tooth is extracted.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But if we have somebody
who is very apprehensive,

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and they really don't
want to lose teeth,

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.650 align:middle line:84%
but they want to live, and they
want to live a healthy life.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:33.840 align:middle line:90%
So here's a conundrum.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So some people will
actually have the tooth

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:90%
tested with super floss.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Send that super floss
to DNA connections,

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and we will tell them if that
root canal tooth has these very

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:90%
virulent, toxic bacteria in it.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You can actually tell before
you have the tooth taken out.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's amazing what
technology is able to do today,

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and we recently visited the
DNA connections lab in Colorado

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Springs.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the laboratory
where they discovered

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
the microorganisms that cause
Lyme disease in one of the root

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.850 align:middle line:90%
canal teeth that I sent here.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Douglas, what would
you like to show us first?

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was just going to
start inoculating some oral

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.820 align:middle line:90%
panels.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:10%
That means we have a plate of
the 88 microbes on the panel

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.490 align:middle line:10%
that we are going to add the
DNA and all of our controls,

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:10%
and then we're going to run
it through the thermal cycler

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:10%
and perform the polymerase chain
reaction to see what organisms

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.100 align:middle line:10%
are in the samples
that we've received

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.650 align:middle line:10%
from biological dentists
across the country.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Once they take digital images,
we upload them to the computer,

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and we take all
of the positives,

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and we record them into our
proprietary software called

00:32:54.660 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Alpha Five, and it'll generate a
report of the microbes present,

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and the overall risk factors
associated with the presence

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:90%
of that microbe.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a
typical oral panel

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.480 align:middle line:10%
report for a root canal sample.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:10%
This practitioner sent
us the root canal tooth

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:18.600 align:middle line:10%
and surrounding blood,
and what you see

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.970 align:middle line:10%
is the different
colored bars represent

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:10%
the relative risk
associated with each microbe

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.310 align:middle line:10%
that we found.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:30.270 align:middle line:10%
And that is, again, based on
the organism's characteristics--

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.200 align:middle line:10%
its overall virulence and
pathogenicity-- as well as

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.620 align:middle line:10%
the amount of organism that
we were able to amplify

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:10%
from the sample.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.220 align:middle line:10%
Three of those
organisms in that genus

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:10%
are involved in metabolic
issues, pregnancy issues,

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:48.380 align:middle line:10%
cancer issues, cognitive
ability issues.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.540 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:10%
We have streptococcus in here.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Strep mitis, strep mutants,
strep intermediates,

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
are directly related

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.760 align:middle line:84%
to a propensity
for cardiac issues.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So now that you've had a
tour of the DNA laboratory,

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and you see how incredibly
specific and scientific every

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:84%
teeny, little step is, and you
can see how exact our science

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:21.870 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know enough
to tell the doctors.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks, again, Dr. Blanche,
for allowing us to be the first

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.909 align:middle line:84%
to go behind the scenes
of DNA Connections.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It's so empowering
to see the technology

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and to give people something
that they can see and work off

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:84%
of that they now
know, hey, maybe

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
this is what's been causing
my health situation.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:34:47.692 --> 00:34:49.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, Dr. Huggins
always used to say,

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:90%
what's more important?

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.040 align:middle line:84%
The life of the tooth, or
the life of the patient?

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:84%
All over the world, they're
looking at root canals.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at the toxins
produced by root canals,

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking at the
relationship between root

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:90%
canals and disease.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So what does the ADA have
to say about the safety of root

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:90%
canals?

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>> They think they're just fine.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I had to take a courage pill to
come on board to do this show

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and to allow all of you to
come into the laboratory

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and actually see
what it is we do.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I guess I finally
matured, and I've

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.000 align:middle line:84%
reached the point in my
life where my life is not

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
as important as
everybody else's life,

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's a point of
maturity for people.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:90%
I reached that point.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.410 align:middle line:84%
My life is not as important
as everybody else's life,

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.360 align:middle line:90%
and people have to know.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So my goal is to teach as many
dentists and as many laypeople

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.122 align:middle line:84%
as I can about the
truth about dentistry.

00:35:49.122 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That was beautifully said.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for sharing
all of your information

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the
documentary, "The Root Cause".

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an excellent,
excellent film.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.710 align:middle line:84%
The only part of that
film that I didn't like

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.010 align:middle line:90%
was that they didn't include me.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I was just a little too
busy at the time when they--

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's take a
look at the trailer.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.327 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.327 --> 00:36:15.790 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:10%
>> There's no branch of medicine
that exists where a dead organ

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:24.300 align:middle line:10%
is left in except in dentistry
where a root canal is left in.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:10%
If you think that
you can get away

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.860 align:middle line:10%
with an infected,
toxic tooth and not

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.690 align:middle line:10%
have a systemic consequence, I
think you're deluding yourself.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>> The vast majority of chronic
degenerative diseases begin

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:10%
with problems in the mouth.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Unfortunately, the dental
schools look at the mouth

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.120 align:middle line:10%
as being a mannequin and
that you can do any type

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:10%
of procedure without any direct
impact on the rest of the body,

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.110 align:middle line:10%
but this is the farthest
thing from the truth.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Of the people that come to
see them with chronic illness,

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:10%
the question is, how many
of them have a dental cause

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:10%
of their illness?

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.670 align:middle line:10%
I would say almost all of them.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:03.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Currently, we have roughly
25 million new root canal

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.840 align:middle line:10%
procedures being done a
year in the United States.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:10%
One of the greatest public
health interventions

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:10%
we could possibly do is to
make the root canal procedure

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.890 align:middle line:10%
something of the
past, because it

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:19.330 align:middle line:10%
does nothing positive for the
general health of the body

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.130 align:middle line:10%
at all.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:29.220 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to say one more
thing about that film though.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:35.600 align:middle line:10%
Do you notice that he didn't
get sick right away after having

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:10%
the root canal done.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:10%
He had the root canal done after
the fight with the young man,

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.570 align:middle line:10%
and he was a young man.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until years later
he started getting symptoms,

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.370 align:middle line:90%
and that's exactly what happens.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.530 align:middle line:84%
People don't walk out
of a dental office

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and drop dead because they
just had a root canal.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:10%
It takes years for the bacteria
to build up, for the toxins

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:10%
to build up to the point where
they begin to get symptoms,

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.600 align:middle line:10%
and that's what makes
it so difficult,

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:10%
to make that connection
between the root

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:10%
canals and your illness.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And everybody's
different too.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> And everybody is different.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.952 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thanks
again, Dr. Blanche.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> In this episode, we've
learned all about the truly

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:16.040 align:middle line:84%
hazardous consequences
of root canals.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.010 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
explore two more very

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:84%
common dental practices,
cavitations and implants.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.100 align:middle line:10%
