00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:10%
I was actually really wanting
to become a heart surgeon,

And it just so happens,
the way the universe works,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:10%
I was at a dinner one night.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
And there was a guy there
talking about natural medicine.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, leading up
to me going into or applying

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to medical school, of
course I'd been studying

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.225 align:middle line:84%
the allopathic methods,
anatomy, physiology,

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, natural
medicine didn't even exist.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:90%
It was just allopathic medicine.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And this guy starts talking
about natural cures for cancer

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and natural cures for disease.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking to myself,
what is this guy talking about?

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.563 align:middle line:90%
He's just a quack.

00:01:32.563 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he starts saying
that he's putting together

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:90%
a research team.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And he starts asking
me questions like,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
"Well, have you looked
into the background

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:90%
of pharmaceutical drugs?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Have you determined
and gone to the library

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
or done any research
to see if they actually

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:90%
do any good in the body?"

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And he starts asking
me these questions.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So of course, my
mind is curious.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no, not really.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So after that dinner, I actually
went and started studying

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:90%
and realized--

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:84%
kind of had a transformation
or one of those aha moments,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
when it was just
like, oh my gosh.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I started looking at
pharmaceutical medications

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and seeing that this doesn't
do any good for the body.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.977 align:middle line:84%
This is just treating
the symptoms of disease.

00:02:15.977 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to him,
and I said, "Teach me

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:90%
everything you know."

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, he
was putting together

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
a team which, in his
definition, was to find

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:90%
the root cause of disease.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But really, he was
focusing on cancer as well.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to work with and
evaluate the different methods

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
that were currently available--
and this was in the mid-'90s--

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that doctors were using to
treat cancer successfully using

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:90%
natural methods.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And that was right during the
time when MD Anderson and some

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
of the cancer centers
were putting together

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that complementary
alternative medicine program.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
At that time, there
was no internet.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't
research you could do.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
There was only one
meeting, and it was kind

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:90%
of underground at the time.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you kind of had
to know the right people

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
or know where to go to
find out information,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
which was the Cancer Control
Society in California.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we started gathering
as much data as we possibly

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.300 align:middle line:84%
could and started
down that road of,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
let's see if we can determine
the root cause of disease

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and met with the
doctors down in Mexico

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:84%
at the Cancer Control
Society Convention

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and started learning
as much as we could,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
evaluating what protocols
these doctors were using,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
evaluating what they have
found was the root cause,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
evaluating what kind
of treatment programs

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:90%
they were using.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:90%
And one thing led to another.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we ended up on at least
a one-year, very intense journey

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:90%
into the root cause of disease.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And still today,
you know, there's

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
so much information out
there that we continue

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:84%
to find beneficial when it comes
to treating the body, mind,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and soul.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, this holistic
approach is definitely

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:90%
where we are at today.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, Ed, this
is an amazing thing for me

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:90%
to be speaking with you.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I have only ever had natural
health care in my own life.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I've never gone to the
doctor and had an antibiotic

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
to heal some ailment
that I was experiencing.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I completely
understand where

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
you're coming from with this
idea of getting to the root

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:90%
cause.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But I would love for you to say
a little bit more about that.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
This message of yours
has been decades old now.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
You're in this idea that
we need to get to the cause

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and not treat the symptom
and not load the body up

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of
pharmaceuticals in order

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.788 align:middle line:90%
to have some healing happen.

00:04:42.788 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So can you just say
a little bit more

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
about what this idea
of the root cause

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
is for our viewers
that might not

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
be as acclimated to this idea
as you and I are in this moment?

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yes, absolutely.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
we wanted to do

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:84%
was to look at why
people were sick.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And talking to
doctors, we evaluated

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
what they were finding
on blood work, what

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:84%
they were finding
by just talking

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:90%
to the individual patient.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you can just
get so much information just

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:90%
by speaking to the individual.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
But what we found was
all disease or the root

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
cause of all disease was
a combination of toxins.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
We looked at-- we broke
it down into categories.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:84%
We found that there's a certain
level of toxins in the air

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
that we breathe, because we're
taking thousands of breaths--

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
30,000 breaths--
every single day.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Most people live
in an environment

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
where they're breathing
toxic indoor air.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
They're breathing
toxic outdoor air.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And air can contain many, many
different forms of toxins.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:84%
What we were looking
at was, how are people

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
being exposed to any type
of disease-causing agent?

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:90%
So we looked at the air first.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
most people that

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
had any type of
disease or condition

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
were exposed to some form
of chemicals in the air.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Then we looked at the food
that they were eating.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So we broke it down into
two categories, basically--

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
the internal environment
and the external environment

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:90%
that people were exposed to.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Air would be external,
food would be internal.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we looked at the
genetically modified foods,

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:84%
the processed foods,
the microwaved foods,

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
all of the
preservatives in foods.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And we found that most of
the foods were contaminated.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Then we looked at water,
which is the number one

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:90%
substance that we have.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all living
things are composed

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
of at least 80% water,
including the earth and plants

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So water was a big
component that we looked at.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And we found that the toxins
in the water supplies,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's fluoride,
bromine, chlorine,

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
prescription drug residue,
endocrine-disrupting chemicals,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of these things,
heavy metals in the water

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:84%
supply, the fracking, which
was even creating natural gases

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:90%
in the water supply--

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.210 align:middle line:84%
so these were contributing
to the toxic load in people.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we looked at
the emotional toxic load

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
as well, because that was a
very important aspect of it,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.310 align:middle line:84%
as far as if someone's
in a state of stress

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
or if someone's in a state
of anger or fear or jealousy

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
or resentment, those
contributed to the toxic load.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the harmful
organisms was the other thing

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that we looked at which
contributed and was associated

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:84%
with not only cancer, but
with every single disease

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:90%
we looked at.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And call it parasites or call it
harmful organisms, any organism

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that lives off of a
host mechanism that

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:90%
does the host mechanism bad.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And we identified and looked at
Royal Raymond Rife's research.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at multiple
areas of research,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
including talking to the
physicians that were treating

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these individuals.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And they always
found high levels

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
of fungus, mold,
bacteria, viruses, worms,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
all of these
different components.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So then we said,
well, let's add up,

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, the amount of
chemicals or toxins somebody

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:84%
might be taking in
through the air every day.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's add up, let's say,
250,000 through the air,

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
250,000 through the food,
250,000 through the water,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:84%
2,050 from the
harmful organisms,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
which these organisms
secrete isopropyl alcohol,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
formaldehyde, phenol,
formalin, which

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
continually create an acid
environment inside the body.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And then let's look at
the emotional toxicity

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and how many toxins
that that may cause.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
Another category we
looked at was trauma.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
Like if someone had
been in an accident,

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have
an electric blockage.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
all of it came back

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to looking at how this affects
the cell on a cellular level,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:84%
because all we are is
100 trillion cells.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And each cell breathes
like we breathe, goes

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to the bathroom, respirates,
and everything else.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So what we found was
the accumulation of all

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
of these chemicals
and all these toxins,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
if you really break it
down, was an interference

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:84%
of this cellular
energetic pathway.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And it stopped the cells
from communicating.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, looking
at Masaru Emoto's work,

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
when you have the
structured form of water,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and then you have, let's
say, a lot of these chemicals

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and toxins that are
getting inside the cell

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:84%
or they're getting in the
extracellular fluid, which

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
is basically water, it's
causing a miscommunication

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
or an interference between
the energetic communication

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
between the cells
and the antenna

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
on the cells, which Bruce
Lipton's research really

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
came into play with
the cell membrane

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:84%
being the brain of the cell
and genes being controlled

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
by our outside
environment and not

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
necessarily the way
medical practitioners

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
or medical science says that
the genes control the organism.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So our next stage
was, well, if someone

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
is taking in all
of these chemicals

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and toxins on a
regular basis, don't we

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:84%
normally have the means to
get rid of all these things?

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we said, OK, well, let's
look at the elimination routes

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:90%
that the body has.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at the four--
five-- elimination routes,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Men have four, and
women have five.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:90%
You have respiration.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to respirate
the chemicals and toxins out.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
sweat the toxins out.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
urinate the toxins out.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
defecate the toxins out.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And women have their
menstrual cycles.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So we knew that there was
an accumulation of all

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:84%
these things that was
basically suppressing

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:84%
cellular communication and
also suppressing the body's

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
own self-healing mechanism,
'cause we also knew

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:90%
that the body is the strongest.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
The body has the ability to
heal any disease by itself.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just being suppressed
by all these things.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So when we looked at
the elimination routes,

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and we said, OK, let's
look at respiration--

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
so if the body's taking in,
let's say, a million chemicals

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and toxins on a daily
basis, how many of those

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
are actually being
respirated out?

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the majority of the
people that we studied

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:84%
that had any type of disease
weren't doing regular exercise

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
or weren't doing aerobic
exercise, where they were

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:90%
increasing their respiration.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Also, sweating--
those individuals

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:90%
weren't sweating enough as well.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So we found that probably 50%
of those two elimination routes

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
were blocked in people with
any type of negative health

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:90%
condition.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Then we looked at urination.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And we found that those
individuals drank very, very

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
little water,
which we know today

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that probably 95% of the
population on the planet

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
is massively dehydrated,
because nobody

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:90%
likes to drink water anymore.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So that elimination
route was blocked.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Then we looked at the
defecation elimination route.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
most people were

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle line:84%
having one bowel movement a day
or one bowel movement a week,

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:84%
one bowel movement
every third day.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So we found that that
elimination route was blocked.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So everything was leading up
to this root cause of disease

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:84%
at that point in time,
saying, oh, well,

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:84%
if all these toxins are
coming in, and none of them

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:84%
are able to get out of the body
because all the elimination

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
routes are blocked, where
are they going to go?

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And that would initiate looking
at all the different types

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:90%
of diseases.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's say heart disease.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the toxins
and chemicals

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
are going to be deposited
in the heart tissue.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Arthritis is going to be
deposited in the joints.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes are going
to be deposited

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
in the islet of
Langerhans cells.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is they
coat the cell membranes.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these toxins coat the
cell membranes, and the cells

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:90%
lose their communication.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:84%
The gates and channels
malfunction in the cells.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And so the cells aren't take
in all the necessary things

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that they might need to
take in to produce insulin.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we realize that, number
one, all of these chemicals

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:90%
and toxins that are coming in.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we realized all of
the elimination routes

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:84%
were blocked or
partially blocked.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we said,
well, let's look

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
at how all these
chemicals and toxins are

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:90%
getting into the body.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:90%
So we looked at breathing.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And we found that probably
only about 5% of the toxins

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
came in through
breathing, because you

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.498 align:middle line:84%
have mucous membranes
that catch a lot of them.

00:13:35.498 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they drain
down into your stomach,

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and then you're able to
eliminate them properly.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:90%
So then we looked at the mouth.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we found that
probably about 95%

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
of the chemicals and toxins
that are entering your body

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:84%
are going to enter through
the digestive tract.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what led
us to the next phase of,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
well, if the majority of
these chemicals and toxins

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:84%
are coming in through the gut,
let's start looking at the gut

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the effects of
how this is contributing

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
to the root cause of disease
and how these chemicals

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and toxins are
acting or not acting

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:90%
or how they're damaging the gut.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we knew that they had
to be damaging the gut, because

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to start
creating all the diseases,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.772 align:middle line:84%
they had to leak through the
gut to get into the bloodstream.

00:14:25.772 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a mouthful.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So you speak about
this external series

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.930 align:middle line:84%
of toxins that are mutating
or clouding, covering,

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
cloaking our ability to get the
receptivity from the cell wall,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.948 align:middle line:84%
as Bruce Lipton's research is
sharing with us in epigenetics,

00:14:48.948 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that would then
translate information

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
into the inner realm of the cell
and tell the cell what to do.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And you also speak
about Emoto's work,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
where we're obviously observing
a transition between even

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:84%
thoughts that can change the
shape of the water, the impact

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:90%
of our own physiology.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So between this internal and
external environmental crisis

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that could be happening
based upon our victimization

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
in the world, the
external context

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
being too strong for
us, overwhelming for us,

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
our own inability to process
our emotional states,

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
et cetera creating a shift in
our internal environment, which

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:90%
do you feel is more important?

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Is it the outer world
is stronger than us?

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we're highly
adaptive creatures, you know?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.082 align:middle line:84%
We're able to
respond to the world.

00:15:38.082 --> 00:15:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it is the outer world
that is bigger than us, that

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
is taking us out of the game?

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Or is it our internal
workings that you

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:90%
feel are a primary cause here?

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Where is the
underlying, root cause

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of our inability to keep
functioning the way we're

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:90%
built to be functioning?

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: I think
it's a combination.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But everybody's
different as well.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the environment
in which you live.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
external environment

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
with the electromagnetic
radiation that we're bombarded

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:84%
with every single day And
Masaru Emoto, before he died,

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
he said that one of the
most damaging things

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.527 align:middle line:84%
that he ever saw that would
not translate back to a crystal

00:16:17.527 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:84%
when he put the water
in front of a TV

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
set when he did his research
was electromagnetic frequencies,

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:84%
harmful electromagnetic
frequencies.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, again,
since we're mostly water,

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I think water has a lot
to do with the toxicity

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:84%
level and the electromagnetics
and our ability

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:90%
to communicate and detoxify.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Because like I
said, ultimately, it

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:84%
goes down to the energetics and
the electromagnetic frequencies

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:90%
of the cell.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think with all the
negativity-- and interesting

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
you asked that, because we
had a case where we were

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:90%
kind of challenged on that.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, we originally came out
with our root cause of disease

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:90%
theory about 21 years ago.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And when Lance Armstrong
ended up getting cancer,

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
we had a lot of people
come back to us and say,

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
"Your theory is wrong, because
Lance Armstrong is healthy.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.470 align:middle line:90%
He's not sick.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And how could he be this
athlete and eat healthy?

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
you're saying is wrong."

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:90%
He's got testicular cancer now.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.254 align:middle line:84%
And that was before we
really made-- that was

00:17:18.254 --> 00:17:19.572 align:middle line:90%
when Louise Hay was coming out.

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was when
Bernie Siegel was

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
doing his work with the
mind and the thoughts

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.315 align:middle line:90%
and how powerful that is.

00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask me
how powerful that is,

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more
powerful than anything.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I don't
think people know

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:90%
how to activate it as much yet.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think meditation
is incredible,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and I thought understanding
the energetics of the body

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:90%
is where we're heading.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But people are taking
those baby steps,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's a little bit
easier for them now, too.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
But I also think in
order to activate that,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:84%
that you can really
speed the process up

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
by detoxifying and changing
your environment internally

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and externally as
well as detoxifying.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think that when
we had that backlash,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.465 align:middle line:84%
we looked for somebody that
was doing everything wrong,

00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:84%
because we were
saying, you know,

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:90%
this is why you have disease.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And we found a guy that was
eating donuts all day long,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:84%
had a sedentary lifestyle,
hadn't exercised,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
was drinking a fifth of
alcohol every single day,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
the worst possible patient
you could have imagined.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:84%
He was on multiple
prescription medications,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:90%
didn't drink any water.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this guy had a
clean bill of health.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So we were kind
of thinking, maybe

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:90%
we're wrong with this theory.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And we went and we analyzed
him for, like, a month.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.098 align:middle line:90%
We went into his house.

00:18:44.098 --> 00:18:46.307 align:middle line:84%
He was smoking, like, four
packs of cigarettes a day.

00:18:46.307 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The walls were
yellow in his house.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It was just, I mean, it
was a disease-ridden area.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things--
the only conclusion

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that we could come
to after about

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
a month of looking at this
guy was how happy he was.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.010 align:middle line:90%
This guy was a jolly old guy.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:90%
He was super happy with himself.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:90%
He had no stress.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:84%
He was laughing all day
long, because the only thing

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
he would watch on
TV on his couch

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:90%
was stuff that made him laugh.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, he would watch "America's
Funniest Home Videos."

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
He would watch comedians
or all these comedy shows.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And we looked and we
analyzed everything.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
we knew that we

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
were missing a big component
of this whole healing process.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we added that
in as a major root cause.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Probably one of the heaviest
root causes to disease

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:84%
is emotional stress related,
because stress can almost

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:84%
override electrically
everything that you're

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:90%
trying to do good in the body.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So that has to be a major
component with counseling,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and you have to detoxify
your emotions as well.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So from that point
on, we started

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
teaching people and even through
the detoxification process,

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
which we learned detoxifying
and healing the gut first,

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
detoxifying and
healing the liver next.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Those are very important stages
that you would go through.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Detoxifying the harmful
organisms next, which we know

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
has a major role to play in
emotional disorders, as well

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
as all this depression,
anxiety, and all these things

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that kids are
dealing with today,

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
as well as chemicals and heavy
metals going up into the brain.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And same thing-- it's a
misfiring of information.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
There's too many chemicals and
toxins up in the brain area.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And after we clean the harmful
organisms out of the body,

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
then the last stage is the
chemicals and heavy metals.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But during that period
of time, people also

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
need to understand
how to keep themself

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:90%
in a parasympathetic state.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I feel that the
majority of people

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
these days live in a sympathetic
state, a fight or flight state.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And talking about
digestion, if you're

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:84%
eating while watching
TV, if you're

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:84%
eating while reading
some negative news,

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating while
listening to music,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.378 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating at your desk
in front of your computer,

00:21:09.378 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
most likely, you're going to
be in a sympathetic state.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's a huge scenario
that we found with people

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:90%
with gut issues.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Because as all these
chemicals and toxins

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:84%
start coming into the
gut, and those individuals

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
are in a sympathetic state,
the digestive process

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:90%
completely comes to a halt.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what we noticed was
people that were eating meal

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:84%
after meal after
meal, these meals

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
would stay undigested
in their systems

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:90%
for 72 hours, 100 hours.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And the proteins were
turning putrefactive.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The carbohydrates
were fermenting.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:90%
The fats were turning rancid.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And that ended up being
a whole new chemical

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:84%
slew that was brewing
inside the intestinal tract.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you're
saying that there

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:84%
are a few roots to the cause,
but that the root cause is

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
ultimately the power of
the mind and the power

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to resolve our own emotional
state so that our system can

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
move out of fight or flight and
into a parasympathetic dominant

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
so that it can be digesting
and filtering and cleansing

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:90%
and healing, et cetera.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we're smart
to eliminate the toxins

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:90%
from our environment.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:90%
But we could go and do that.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And if we're doing it out of
anger or frustration or fear,

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
we're actually not going to
create the healing environment

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:84%
within that we're attempting to
do if we're trying to eliminate

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:84%
all these external things
from a state of anything

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.977 align:middle line:84%
other than joy or harmony
or peace or laughter,

00:22:35.977 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:90%
as you were sharing.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.662 align:middle line:90%
Is this the key?

00:22:37.662 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: I think
a big part of this

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
is another thing
that we learned,

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
was people need to understand
why they're sick to begin with.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:84%
When we had our clinic,
and people would come in,

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and they had already been seen
by 10, 15 different doctors

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.917 align:middle line:90%
for 10 or 15 years.

00:22:53.917 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And they would come sit
down and say, "Well,

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
what are you going to do for
me that nobody else did?"

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we would just sit
there and say, "Well,

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
can you tell me why
you have cancer?

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start off
by you explaining to me

why you have cancer or
why you have heart disease

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.980 align:middle line:90%
or why you have diabetes."

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.063 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fantastic question.

00:23:10.063 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And they
would say, "Well, I

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
don't know why I have cancer
or diabetes or heart disease."

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And we would say,
"Well, don't you

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
think that you need to
understand why you have

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:84%
the disease in order to
understand and fully accept

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:90%
how to get rid of the disease?"

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: You know, if I'm
going to rewire my house,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to study electricity.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just going to go, you
know, stick a bunch of wires

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.517 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:23:33.517 --> 00:23:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And then the
next thing-- and then,

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, this light
would come on inside.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:84%
It was like, no one's ever
explain that to me before.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And you know, part of
the healing process

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.490 align:middle line:84%
starts in the first
couple hours when

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:84%
you're with a patient, because
then we would say after that,

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:84%
"Well, let me ask
you another question.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:90%
What makes you happy?

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.795 align:middle line:90%
What do you do for fun?"

00:23:54.795 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And they would all just
sit there, and most of them

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:90%
would start crying.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And they would just
say, "I don't know.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
makes me happy.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.027 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I do for fun."

00:24:06.027 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They've lost touch.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.985 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: When's the last
time you've had fun,

00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:84%
or when's the last
time you were happy?

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, health
equals self-confidence,

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.370 align:middle line:90%
which equals success.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
When's the last time you
looked yourself in the mirror

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:90%
and said, "I feel so good today.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take on the world.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I am super happy"?

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:90%
We would ask them that.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, "Probably
when I was, like, 14, 15."

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And here they are,
like, 45 years old.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Decades.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.458 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And they're
decades later,

00:24:31.458 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
unhappy with themself.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.470 align:middle line:90%
They haven't loved themself.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And so then we would
say, "I tell you

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to do that
none of the other doctors

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:90%
have done for you.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, a doctor should
be a teacher first, not

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:90%
a prescriber.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
My job is to teach you
how to heal yourself.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:84%
My job is to teach you how
to reactivate your body's

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.090 align:middle line:90%
self-healing mechanism.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So first off,
we're going to talk

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle line:84%
about why you have the
disease that you have today."

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we start
going into the toxins and all

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
the other stuff and start
explaining to them about

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and start talking to them
about their emotions and all

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:90%
that stuff as well.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And then what we would do, like
the old-school doctors would

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
do years ago, is they would
actually go to their house.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many
things we've discovered

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:90%
by going to patients' homes.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.572 align:middle line:84%
They will tell you that
they're eating healthy.

00:25:22.572 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:84%
They will tell you that they
don't have any chemicals

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.830 align:middle line:90%
and toxins in their home.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:84%
They will tell you that their
bedroom is a nice sanctuary

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.960 align:middle line:90%
that they can sleep in.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.893 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Blinders.

00:25:30.893 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And we
would go in there,

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.643 align:middle line:84%
and we would look up and see
that their air conditioning

00:25:34.643 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:90%
vents were black, full of mold.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
We would go into their kitchen
and just completely see

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:84%
all these chemical
cleaning products.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, their water
would be contaminated.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:90%
We would test their water.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
All their cookware
would be toxic.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.637 align:middle line:84%
And their bedroom would
be-- one of the first things

00:25:50.637 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that we would do when we would
go into someone's house is work

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:84%
on their bedroom and get them
to be able to sleep eight

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.880 align:middle line:84%
hours a night at least
in a very dark room,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:84%
in a very healing
oasis in their room.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
They would have memory
foam mattresses.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.702 align:middle line:84%
They would have
pillows that weighed,

00:26:07.702 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:84%
like, 15 pounds,
full of dust mites.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And their air quality would
be horrible in their room.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.580 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to put
air purification

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:90%
systems in their ceiling.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I'm feeling
worse already.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So I mean, you
know-- but they would go

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.790 align:middle line:90%
through that process with us.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And as they would
understand, we would explain.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And it would literally
transform their life,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.480 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what it was about,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:84%
them understanding the reason
why they're in the situation

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that they're in and then
helping them transition

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.540 align:middle line:90%
to a more healthy lifestyle.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, never just, you
know, doing everything at once,

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.590 align:middle line:84%
We would always
explain, like, picture

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.148 align:middle line:84%
a long staircase of health
going all the way up to the sky.

00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you have to
live by the-- you know,

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.138 align:middle line:84%
if you can live by the 80-20
rule, you're doing great.

00:26:53.138 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
most people in society

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:84%
live by the 10-90
rule right now.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They do 90% of stuff
wrong and 10% right.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So even if you can get over
that hump a little bit,

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:84%
you're still doing
really, really good.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.877 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: But we would say
it's baby steps, you know?

00:27:06.877 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:84%
If you get a water
purification system,

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.267 align:middle line:84%
you just climbed 500 steps
up the stairs to hell.

00:27:12.267 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: One step at a time.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And as long as you're
doing one step at a time--

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:84%
next time you go
to the store, buy

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Himalayan crystal salt instead
of the regular toxic salt.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, next time you're going
to go buy food for your family,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:90%
go get organic food.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And you know, then you
took another 500 steps up.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have lists
of all of the things

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that we identified, from
personal care products to air

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.980 align:middle line:90%
fresheners to sunscreens to--

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically
everything that someone

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
would do from the
time that they wake up

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:84%
all the way until the
time that they go to bed.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.478 align:middle line:84%
And we would even go
to their office as well

00:27:46.478 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and go check out the
things in their office

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.813 align:middle line:84%
and see what they're
exposed to, if they

00:27:50.813 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:84%
are exposed to
different chemicals

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.040 align:middle line:90%
in the workplace, et cetera.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But by cleaning all
that up and then

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
working with them
over a period of time

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and then detoxifying
them correctly,

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that's how we would
get such good results

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:90%
and positive results.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So are you
educating other doctors

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:90%
in this same arena?

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has been a
project of my life as well.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just really
curious how you

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
are seeing this unfold in the
traditional medical practices,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.457 align:middle line:84%
Patients are on medications
because they've been going

00:28:26.457 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:90%
to the traditional doctor.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.430 align:middle line:84%
They're doing what they're
doing with what they've

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.570 align:middle line:84%
been trained to
do, what they think

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to be doing.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And now people are
waking up, and we're

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:84%
having this kind
of a conversation

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.120 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.377 align:middle line:90%
And so people are curious.

00:28:38.377 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, does
that mean I shouldn't

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.230 align:middle line:90%
be doing what I was doing?

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Am I hurting myself?

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Am I helping?

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.990 align:middle line:84%
How do I get two steps ahead
without three steps back?

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:90%
You know, where are we to begin?

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:84%
How do people know
what to do when

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.030 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to navigate their
traditional medical doctors'

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
advice, and now this rising
information about the power's

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.020 align:middle line:84%
in our hands, that our internal
ability to process information

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.210 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do
with our level of health?

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And we've invented ourselves
out of a healthy environment

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.700 align:middle line:84%
with all the electromagnetic
energies that

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:90%
are surrounding us.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So what can you tell us
about where do we start?

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:90%
How do we navigate?

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
How do we get our
feet on the ground?

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yeah.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
First of all, just waking
up and opening your mind

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to think that maybe not
everything that you've

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:90%
been taught is real.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.020 align:middle line:84%
As far as the doctors,
more and more of them

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.240 align:middle line:84%
are opening up and
learning more and more,

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:84%
because they've watched their
parents die in the system.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:84%
They've watched their
grandparents die in the system.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of these newer, younger
doctors that are still

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:84%
coming up in the
system right now,

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
they're still not heavily
talking about this, obviously.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But you have right now
pharmaceutical companies

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:84%
that are buying dietary
supplement companies left

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:90%
and right.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They see that there's
a big organic movement.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:84%
They see that there's a big
health movement out there.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it's still
not based on the root cause.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, even the naturopathic
schools, chiropractic schools,

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that's where I'm trying
to get the information out

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to teach the
individuals that healing

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to be hard, right?

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we don't need 500
supplements in our cabinet.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I used to have 650 supplements
in my cabinet a long time ago.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I was taught-- naturopathic
school, chiropractic school--

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, someone walks in with
a headache or whatever.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Here's the different herbs
that you can put them on.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:84%
You can put them on
white willow bark.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.495 align:middle line:84%
It's still treating the
symptoms, but not the root

00:30:34.495 --> 00:30:34.600 align:middle line:90%
cause.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Exactly.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:84%
It's healthier, but it's
still treating the symptoms.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And it works
to a certain degree.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But I've always been
the kind of person

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
that's looked for simplicity in
how we can reactivate and teach

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
people how to
reactivate their body's

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:84%
own self-healing mechanism
through the things

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and the power that
the body actually

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
has, through water-only fasting
or through detoxification,

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.850 align:middle line:90%
through changing lifestyle.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And because doctors
are now being

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:84%
faced with more and more
questions from patients-- like,

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.260 align:middle line:84%
patients are now going
into doctor's offices

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.547 align:middle line:90%
with bags full of supplements.

00:31:12.547 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, "Doc, can I
take this with the medication?

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Can I take this with the
medication you have me on?

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:10%
Can I take this?"

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.210 align:middle line:10%
And the doctors are being
forced to learn about it.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:10%
So I think that's
also a positive thing.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So I do think we're making
positive change as far

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:84%
as education-wise, because
I think that everything

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:84%
starts with education, like,
the proper type of education.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I think kids should be taught
from an early age about how

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
to listen to their body, how to
pay attention to the symptoms.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.430 align:middle line:84%
See, we're never even taught
that if we have a headache,

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that we're supposed
to be thinking, well,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
was that something that
I might have eaten,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.920 align:middle line:90%
or what did I do wrong?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Did I sleep wrong?

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Or a way of thinking.

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.457 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Or a way of thinking
or anything like that.

00:31:52.457 --> 00:31:54.692 align:middle line:84%
We're taught, if
we have a headache,

00:31:54.692 --> 00:31:56.275 align:middle line:84%
we need to go take
some aspirin, or we

00:31:56.275 --> 00:31:58.880 align:middle line:84%
need to go take something to
take care of the headache.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Fever is a great
example of that.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.910 align:middle line:84%
How much has it been
ingrained into people

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that as soon as your kids or
you start running a fever,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:90%
you need to reduce the fever?

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.152 align:middle line:84%
It's the most
bizarre thing ever.

00:32:11.152 --> 00:32:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: We shut it down.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Like, my kid's
gotten up to 106.7 before.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.230 align:middle line:84%
When we were treating
cancer patients,

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.647 align:middle line:84%
we were using hyperthermia,
where we would heat the cancer

00:32:19.647 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:84%
cells up, and they
would die around 106,

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.190 align:middle line:90%
still being used today.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Normal cells will die
somewhere around 107,

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:90%
something like that degrees.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the natural process,
because bacteria, viruses,

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and organisms will die
from 99 to 105, usually.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So why are we stopping the
normal, natural process

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
of the body to kill
off all the organisms

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.810 align:middle line:90%
and then pop right out of it?

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're suppressing our
own natural, innate healing

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:90%
ability.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: That healing mechanism.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: The healing mechanism.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Can you speak--

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.897 align:middle line:84%
I know you use those words
specifically, the healing

00:32:56.897 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:90%
mechanism within the body.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.898 align:middle line:84%
Now can you just
speak right into that?

00:32:59.898 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I know you're talking
about that right now.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:84%
But just to clarify
for people, you

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:84%
know, what is it that
happens right there?

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.255 align:middle line:84%
The body is trying
to heal itself.

00:33:07.255 --> 00:33:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing things
that are shutting down

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.200 align:middle line:90%
its ability to do so.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.555 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak more about that?

00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Yeah, the
self-healing mechanism

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is the energy that your
body has to heal itself.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you the
best example that I

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:84%
know about that was an example
from a researcher in the 1940s

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and '50s named Arnold Ehret.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And what he determined
through studying

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
in his hygienic--

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and he put people on fasting
and studied digestion

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and studied different types of
diets, fruitarian diets, vegan

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.100 align:middle line:90%
diets, all that stuff.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:84%
His conclusion was that
the biggest reduction

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:84%
of energy that we have
from healing the body

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:90%
is because we eat too much.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And he found that what
we should really be doing

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:90%
is only eating one meal a day.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Now picture this.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.590 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of his philosophy
of how he describes this.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The body only has-- if you
calculate decay counts and all

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.707 align:middle line:84%
that-- the body only
has enough energy--

00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and this is in a
perfect state, right?

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:84%
This is not in a state of
stress, in a state of confusion

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:90%
like most people are in today.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Your body only really
has enough energy

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.880 align:middle line:84%
to break down one
big meal a day.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So if we're eating two or
three or four meals a day,

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:84%
our body doesn't have
the energy reserves

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to be able to break
down those meals,

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.040 align:middle line:84%
because digestion takes the
most amount of our energy

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our digestive
tract is 30 feet long.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.340 align:middle line:84%
If you spread it out, it's
the size of a tennis court.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And it consumes all of our
energy totally from the body.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at the
self-healing mechanism,

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.370 align:middle line:84%
your body is going to have to
generate energy and take energy

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.190 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.577 align:middle line:84%
That's why the body
heals extremely fast

00:34:56.577 --> 00:34:57.410 align:middle line:90%
when you're fasting.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why animals,
when they get hurt

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
or they have a broken
bone, they lay down,

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.030 align:middle line:90%
and they do dry fasting.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat or drink.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And their body heals within,
like, 72 hours, like bones

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and everything like
that completely healed

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.640 align:middle line:90%
so they can get up.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:84%
When you take the energy
away-- and the body

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:84%
goes into autophagy when
you start fasting, too.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And this proves that eating is
one of the biggest detriments

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.230 align:middle line:84%
to us having a healthy,
very strong immune system,

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.100 align:middle line:84%
considering also that
USC came out with a study

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and found that 72 hours
of water-only fasting

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:38.550 align:middle line:84%
produced immune stem cells and
regenerated the immune system.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Now I've been studying
medicine for 25, 30 years.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything that
can produce immune stem cells

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and regenerate the immune
system in 72 hours.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So when we talk about
the self-healing mechanism,

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:56.210 align:middle line:84%
it's allowing enough
energy for your body

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to be able to focus on what
needs to be healed the most

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and do it in a very
rapid way so it can heal

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and move on and repair itself.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And so in this biggest
picture, what would you

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:84%
say is the ultimate
secret to healing?

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: The ultimate
secret to healing

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:84%
would be for you
to keep your body

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and your mind clean
on a regular basis,

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that your
external environment is clean,

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.180 align:middle line:84%
make sure your internal
environment is clean.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:84%
That means cleansing and healing
your bowel on a regular basis.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, that should be done
almost on a weekly basis.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying everybody
needs to be on a raw food diet.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody's diet
needs could be done.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe there's one
perfect diet for everybody

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.270 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I do like the
intermittent fasting,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.730 align:middle line:84%
because it takes
one meal a day out.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Just taking one meal a day
from what you're eating

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.620 align:middle line:90%
will boost your energy stores.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate secret
to health, number one,

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is understanding what
causes poor health.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Number two, what
we've determined

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and what's worked
for the last 25 years

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.945 align:middle line:84%
is cleansing the mind,
body, and soul, keeping

00:37:12.945 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:84%
all of that cleansed
on a regular basis

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:84%
through cleansing
and heal the gut,

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.340 align:middle line:84%
the liver, cleansing the harmful
organisms out of the body,

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.190 align:middle line:84%
cleansing the chemicals and
heavy metals out of the body,

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and doing what you need to
do through deep breathing

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.500 align:middle line:84%
exercises, let's say,
to take yourself out

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.510 align:middle line:84%
of a sympathetic
state, put yourself

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:33.380 align:middle line:84%
in a parasympathetic state,
and tons of meditation.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer
in meditation.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I was challenged
on that years ago,

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.692 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about the
benefits of meditation.

00:37:40.692 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Someone said, "Well, how
much do you meditate?"

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, maybe a couple
minutes here and there."

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So I did a whole year of working
up to 2 and 1/2 hours a day,

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.720 align:middle line:84%
from 4:00 to 6:00 AM for
a whole year straight.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.990 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I went on
a strictly raw food diet.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do an
experiment on myself

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.010 align:middle line:90%
to see how everything went.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
The meditation completely
transformed me.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.620 align:middle line:84%
The raw food diet, I would say
that, from a social standpoint,

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.170 align:middle line:90%
that kind of isolated me.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe in
doing anything 100%

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.950 align:middle line:90%
and giving up everything.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Again, I believe in the 80-20.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:22.682 align:middle line:84%
I believe you have to
give yourself some things.

00:38:22.682 --> 00:38:24.890 align:middle line:84%
The more you restrict yourself
from things sometimes,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.630 align:middle line:90%
the more you want them.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But now I've logged close to
7,000 hours of meditation.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get to
that 10,000 hour mark.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And every day, it's been
a vital part of my life.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that that can
transform people's lives as far

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.920 align:middle line:84%
as the benefits of
meditation with stress relief

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and balancing hormones
and all the other things.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Balancing mind,
body, spirit ultimately

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.610 align:middle line:90%
is the key, right?

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.927 align:middle line:84%
We have to land back
home for ourselves.

00:38:55.927 --> 00:38:58.010 align:middle line:84%
There's so much conflicting
information out there.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:84%
There's so much that
people are hearing

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to know where
to start and where to begin.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that you're leading
us in a direction that

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.400 align:middle line:90%
is helpful--

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.060 align:middle line:84%
not to try to give up
everything all at once, 100%,

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:90%
chuck this and only do this.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Because some people can't
eat raw foods right now

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:14.630 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Other people can't seem to
imagine sitting and meditating

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.870 align:middle line:90%
for two hours at a time.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But to take one step
at a time, to start

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.780 align:middle line:84%
to wean some things away
and be present to themselves

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and know what they
can tolerate, this

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.880 align:middle line:84%
is basically what you're
offering up as guidance.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And I so appreciate
your come from being

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.310 align:middle line:84%
comprehensive in
the way that it is.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.180 align:middle line:84%
This is what the awakening
humanity is certainly

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:90%
ready to hear.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.115 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Well, thank you.

00:39:43.115 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We have someone here
who has worked with Dr. Group

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to take back control
of their own health.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Loretta Lanphier had
stage III cancer.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But by following Dr.
Group's protocol,

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.940 align:middle line:90%
she was able to heal herself.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's meet Loretta.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Loretta.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Are you there?

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear us?

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LORETTA LANPHIER: I can.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:10%
Can you hear me?

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.090 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Sweet.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:02.290 align:middle line:10%
Yes, indeed.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:06.040 align:middle line:10%
So what can you share with
us about your experience

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.660 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Group?

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:11.770 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Well, I went
to Dr. Group back in 2001

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.520 align:middle line:10%
for stage III colon cancer.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.330 align:middle line:10%
I had a diagnosis in
September of 2000.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:23.260 align:middle line:10%
I'd done one month of
chemotherapy, had surgery

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:10%
to get the tumor,
and the chemotherapy

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:10%
was just horrendous.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:33.610 align:middle line:10%
So we decided to find somebody
that could work alternatively,

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.570 align:middle line:10%
a big step out of
the box for us.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.990 align:middle line:10%
But I would have done
anything at that point

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.460 align:middle line:10%
not to have to do chemotherapy.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:44.590 align:middle line:10%
So we looked on the internet,
and Global Healing Center came

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.720 align:middle line:10%
up, and we made an appointment.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.670 align:middle line:10%
And I had done some research.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.550 align:middle line:10%
And with Dr.
Group's appointment,

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:10%
basically, he was just
reiterating everything

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.290 align:middle line:10%
that I had read.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.690 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: So did you
interrupt your chemotherapy

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.170 align:middle line:10%
to go and see Dr. Group?

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.260 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Well, what
happened is they had me

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.310 align:middle line:10%
on a regimen to where I did one
chemotherapy a week for four

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:12.190 align:middle line:10%
weeks, had a week off, and
then I would start again.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.250 align:middle line:10%
They wanted me to do
six rounds of that.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:19.120 align:middle line:10%
I got to the fourth
treatment of the first round

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:10%
and ended up in the hospital
with severe dehydration.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.470 align:middle line:10%
So I felt like the
chemotherapy would

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:31.645 align:middle line:10%
get me far quicker
than the cancer would.

00:41:31.645 --> 00:41:33.520 align:middle line:10%
I mean, according to
them, I was cancer-free.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.420 align:middle line:10%
There was no tumor.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.940 align:middle line:10%
There was no metastasis.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.870 align:middle line:10%
So I didn't feel like
I was going to make it

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.290 align:middle line:10%
by doing chemotherapy.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.630 align:middle line:10%
And so my husband actually
had been looking online.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.420 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know he had been.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:10%
But we decided to just go
and talk and just see what

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.590 align:middle line:10%
there was out there to offer.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:58.540 align:middle line:10%
And Dr. Group was
good-- yeah, I think

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:10%
he talked with us about an
hour and a half that day.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.880 align:middle line:10%
And when we left the office,
we got into the elevator.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.810 align:middle line:10%
And I told my husband,
I said, "I really

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.250 align:middle line:10%
think this is where
I'm supposed to be."

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, he was kind of hesitant,
mainly because people don't

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.400 align:middle line:10%
save up for this kind of thing.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.880 align:middle line:10%
You know, it can be costly,
although Dr. Group's pricing

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:24.370 align:middle line:10%
was very much out of line with
what the others were charging.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.680 align:middle line:10%
They were charging
horrendous amounts.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:10%
So long story short, my parents
said, "Hey, we'll pay for it.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.630 align:middle line:10%
Let's do it."

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.400 align:middle line:10%
And so we started the
first part of February

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.680 align:middle line:10%
with a full
detoxification program.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:10%
We started with liver,
gallbladder, and colon

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.080 align:middle line:10%
cleansing using his
Oxy-Powder product.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.990 align:middle line:10%
And we did harmful
organism cleansing, which

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:51.790 align:middle line:10%
would be parasite cleansing.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:58.420 align:middle line:10%
And the detoxification part of
the program was foundational.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:03.070 align:middle line:10%
And I did that throughout the
whole protocol off and on.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.798 align:middle line:10%
And we did cleansing.

00:43:05.798 --> 00:43:07.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be looking
up and down a little bit,

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:10%
'cause this was 20 years ago.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.530 align:middle line:10%
So I want to make sure
that I get everything.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.600 align:middle line:10%
We did heavy metal
cleansing also.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.150 align:middle line:10%
So his approach was a whole
body approach, a mind, body,

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:18.340 align:middle line:10%
and spirit.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.470 align:middle line:10%
Of course, diet
was foundational.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:24.540 align:middle line:10%
I did vegetable juicing,
pancreatic enzymes,

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.720 align:middle line:10%
and supplements.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.480 align:middle line:10%
I brought a bag of supplements
into my visit with him,

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.840 align:middle line:10%
and I was pretty proud of what I
had been doing in the meantime.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.250 align:middle line:10%
And he took one look at them
and put them down on the floor.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:40.100 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, you
know, aren't those good?

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:10%
But when I got on
the protocol, I

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.550 align:middle line:10%
realized that we were
going to be doing much more

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:48.350 align:middle line:10%
high-tech stuff than what I
could get at the local vitamin

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.150 align:middle line:10%
store.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:55.510 align:middle line:10%
So it was very intense for
me, because I was not used

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:10%
to doing anything like that.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:10%
But at the same
time, I didn't want

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:03.700 align:middle line:10%
to do chemotherapy ever again.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:10%
And I told him that he could
tell me to stand on my head

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.075 align:middle line:10%
three hours a day,
and I'll do it.

00:44:10.075 --> 00:44:15.730 align:middle line:10%
And I was very much--

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.980 align:middle line:10%
it was a 24/7 thing.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:10%
And I did everything
he told me to do.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.230 align:middle line:10%
Part of the detoxification
that we did also,

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:30.310 align:middle line:10%
we did emotional detoxification.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:34.210 align:middle line:10%
The diagnosis just really
hit me on my backside.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:38.920 align:middle line:10%
I was not expecting it,
as most people aren't.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:43.170 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, your mind just
runs with that kind of thing.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:43.970 align:middle line:10%
What if?

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:45.010 align:middle line:10%
You know, what if I do?

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.723 align:middle line:10%
What if I don't?

00:44:46.723 --> 00:44:48.640 align:middle line:10%
You know, people would
talk about, well, we're

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.170 align:middle line:10%
going to do this next summer?

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:53.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'd think, am I going
to be here next summer?

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.710 align:middle line:10%
And very much of a
victim mentality.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:01.770 align:middle line:10%
And he was very good to realize
that I needed that help.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:04.050 align:middle line:10%
And so he would
recommend books for me,

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:09.150 align:middle line:10%
and I would read them and
talk about negativity.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.980 align:middle line:10%
I tend to be that way anyway.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:16.170 align:middle line:10%
And so that was a real big
issue with me, to just,

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:10%
you know, take
control of my mind

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.892 align:middle line:10%
so that my body could heal.

00:45:20.892 --> 00:45:22.350 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Was there
a moment, Loretta,

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.600 align:middle line:10%
that you made a decision?

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Did you feel something
happen inside

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.160 align:middle line:10%
of you that claimed something
in the process of all

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.510 align:middle line:10%
these detoxifications and
changing your supplementation

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:10%
and revamping how
you're thinking

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.990 align:middle line:10%
and your emotional states?

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.880 align:middle line:10%
Was there ever a
collective moment

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.390 align:middle line:10%
where you felt yourself just
come home to yourself, just

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:47.892 align:middle line:10%
come back together in some way
that shifted this path for you?

00:45:47.892 --> 00:45:49.350 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Yeah,
there really was.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.870 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I was very guarded
about that kind of thing

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.440 align:middle line:10%
to begin with.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:58.810 align:middle line:10%
Because even though I was very
much aboard what we were doing

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:10%
and I wanted to do it, there was
still that mind going, what if?

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.530 align:middle line:10%
What if?

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:10%
I remember we had taken
a vacation in July

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.620 align:middle line:10%
and gone to the Grand
Canyon, my husband and I.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.570 align:middle line:10%
We were walking
around, and I happened

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.940 align:middle line:10%
to walk out on one of
those little jutted places

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.760 align:middle line:10%
where you might feel
like you're on the edge.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.460 align:middle line:10%
And there were people out there.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.647 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not a high person,
and so I felt kind of safe

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:24.480 align:middle line:10%
with them out there.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.570 align:middle line:10%
But I was looking around, and
I noticed everybody had left.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:29.570 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at the
vastness of the canyon.

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:30.840 align:middle line:10%
It was in the evening.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:10%
The colors were coming out.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.810 align:middle line:10%
They were vibrant.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.000 align:middle line:10%
And I thought to myself, you
know, God, if you can do this,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.020 align:middle line:10%
you can certainly help
me heal from cancer.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.460 align:middle line:10%
And that was my moment.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.450 align:middle line:10%
I was starting to
allow myself to believe

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.940 align:middle line:10%
that I could get
well, 'cause I wasn't

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.530 align:middle line:10%
really sure that I could.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:50.920 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: So, so beautiful.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.560 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much
for sharing that.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.380 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a very
important thing for people

00:46:55.380 --> 00:47:00.390 align:middle line:10%
to recognize that when we just
accept the possibility that I

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.580 align:middle line:10%
got this, I can do
this, that then things

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:03.600 align:middle line:10%
can begin to change.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.032 align:middle line:10%
And until that happens,
it's a pretty tough thing.

00:47:07.032 --> 00:47:08.990 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much for
sharing with us, Loretta.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:10.170 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: You're welcome.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.128 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Just one moment.

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:15.150 align:middle line:10%
I want to ask Dr. Group, what
was the most important thing

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.970 align:middle line:10%
that you would say
turned on Loretta's

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.400 align:middle line:10%
self-healing mechanism?

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.160 align:middle line:10%
What would you say
happened there?

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.040 align:middle line:10%
>>GROUP: I think the
main thing with anybody

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.490 align:middle line:10%
is the moment that they
have faith and hope.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I always talk about hope
and faith all the time.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so important
to educate and to help them

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.950 align:middle line:84%
along the way to
where they really

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.670 align:middle line:84%
can believe that they have
the power to heal themself.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Because in the standard
medical system,

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.560 align:middle line:90%
they trust their doctor.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.470 align:middle line:84%
All of their hope and all of
their faith is on their doctor.

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not on them.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.400 align:middle line:10%
And so I think that,
over the years,

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.740 align:middle line:10%
the most pivotal point
with every patient

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.960 align:middle line:10%
is the moment where
they actually believe

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.305 align:middle line:10%
they can heal themselves.

00:47:59.305 --> 00:48:01.430 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And this is what
you're describing, Loretta.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:02.388 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Absolutely.

00:48:02.388 --> 00:48:05.560 align:middle line:10%
If he told me that once, he
told me that a million times.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:10%
It was just difficult to--

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.410 align:middle line:10%
it's like you're making a
commitment when you say, OK, I

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:11.580 align:middle line:10%
know I can get well.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.350 align:middle line:10%
I know I'm going to get well.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.510 align:middle line:10%
And I was afraid to
make that commitment,

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.550 align:middle line:10%
because what if it
wasn't right, you know?

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.770 align:middle line:10%
I asked him and my husband
both a million times,

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:21.985 align:middle line:10%
do you think I'm
going to get well?

00:48:21.985 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I got to where
they just rolled their eyes,

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.610 align:middle line:10%
'cause they knew I was coming.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.110 align:middle line:10%
But you know, I needed not
only to believe myself,

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.140 align:middle line:10%
but I needed to know that Dr.
Group thought I could get well.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.290 align:middle line:10%
I needed to know that my husband
thought I could get well.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:37.160 align:middle line:10%
They were kind of holding me
up, if you know what I'm saying.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.290 align:middle line:10%
But then when I took
that step and started

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:43.680 align:middle line:10%
to allow myself to believe
that I could get well--

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.340 align:middle line:10%
and it came slowly.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.270 align:middle line:10%
And when I did get well, I
was well in seven months.

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.990 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: At the end of the day,
it was your own decision.

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:53.590 align:middle line:10%
It was your decision
to get well.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.333 align:middle line:10%
It was your acceptance
of that possibility

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.250 align:middle line:10%
is what you're saying.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:00.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, Loretta, here's the deal.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm a viewer at home.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:02.580 align:middle line:90%
I've got cancer.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
to chemotherapy.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
through that radiation.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:08.670 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to have to
have that experience.

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.620 align:middle line:10%
Please walk us
through exactly what

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.260 align:middle line:10%
you did that allowed
this transformation

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.040 align:middle line:10%
to happen in your life.

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.290 align:middle line:10%
Just start from the beginning.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.290 align:middle line:10%
What did you do?

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: OK.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.220 align:middle line:10%
Like I said before,
we did cleansing,

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:23.610 align:middle line:10%
was the very foundational
part at the beginning--

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.700 align:middle line:10%
liver, gallbladder flushing,
very, very important.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.430 align:middle line:10%
Digestive tract
cleansing, in my case--

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.880 align:middle line:10%
well, in every cancer case--
that's going to be important.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.930 align:middle line:10%
I did that pretty much the
whole time through off and on.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:41.800 align:middle line:10%
Harmful organism cleansing,
parasite cleansing, and also

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.780 align:middle line:10%
that would include
yeast cleansing,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:48.060 align:middle line:10%
which is a real issue right
now in so many health concerns.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.660 align:middle line:10%
Heavy metal cleansing--
if you've got amalgams

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:10%
or if you've been around heavy
metals, that needs to happen.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:00.970 align:middle line:10%
The diet-- I did a lot of
juicing in the beginning.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:05.090 align:middle line:10%
In fact, my mealtime
at dinner was juice.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:08.730 align:middle line:10%
He put together a very
nutrient-dense juice

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.580 align:middle line:10%
that I drank every night.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.370 align:middle line:10%
We used high-tech
supplementation.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:20.020 align:middle line:10%
I used ozonated water
and pancreatic enzymes.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And one more thing.

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:10%
I did a lot of lymphatic
drainage techniques,

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:28.860 align:middle line:10%
such as I went and got a
little round rebounder,

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.140 align:middle line:10%
and I rebounded every day.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:35.160 align:middle line:10%
I started out at 3.5 minutes
in the morning and 3.5 minutes

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:35.993 align:middle line:10%
in the evening.

00:50:35.993 --> 00:50:37.660 align:middle line:10%
That's all I could
handle at that point.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.880 align:middle line:10%
I was just coming
off of surgery.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:10%
And so eventually,
I built that up.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.988 align:middle line:10%
I did it every day,
morning and afternoon.

00:50:44.988 --> 00:50:46.530 align:middle line:10%
And finally, I got
to the point where

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:49.630 align:middle line:10%
I was doing it almost an
hour and a half a day.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:54.060 align:middle line:10%
So also for that
lymphatic drainage,

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:59.740 align:middle line:10%
I did skin brushing and
toxin removal baths also.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.600 align:middle line:10%
But one thing that
I did, too, is

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:07.030 align:middle line:10%
that I went through our home,
and I removed everything

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.710 align:middle line:10%
that I thought was
toxic in our home.

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:17.870 align:middle line:10%
That included laundry--
so dishwasher detergent.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:22.870 align:middle line:10%
We got air filtration in the
rooms that we were in most.

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:30.360 align:middle line:10%
We after the air filtration,
we also put some--

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.476 align:middle line:10%
I don't even know--
some devices in for EMF

00:51:33.476 --> 00:51:38.500 align:middle line:10%
on our phones to make sure that
we weren't dealing with that.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:43.240 align:middle line:10%
I did not put my hands in any
chlorinated water, period.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.230 align:middle line:10%
Our toothpaste, our soaps,
our shampoos, everything

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:49.450 align:middle line:10%
went in the trash.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:53.620 align:middle line:10%
Because I felt like that what
I had been doing in my life

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.770 align:middle line:10%
obviously was not
conducive to health,

00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:58.420 align:middle line:10%
or I wouldn't have
been where I was.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:02.600 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't have been diagnosed
with stage III colon cancer.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.590 align:middle line:10%
So I got interested
in aromatherapy.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:06.800 align:middle line:10%
We did that.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.040 align:middle line:10%
I also, every morning
when I got up,

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.610 align:middle line:10%
there's a program called
the Mozart Effect.

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:13.750 align:middle line:10%
There are CDs.

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:15.970 align:middle line:10%
That is the Mozart's
music who it's

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:17.680 align:middle line:10%
thought to be very healing.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.530 align:middle line:10%
So as I would be getting
dressed, I would put that on.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.150 align:middle line:10%
And I would listen to
that in the mornings

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:24.780 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of times at night.

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Group had a manual that he
gave that was a cancer survival

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:30.010 align:middle line:10%
manual.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And in that manual,
there were scriptures.

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:34.120 align:middle line:10%
There were affirmations.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.220 align:middle line:10%
There was prayers.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:39.380 align:middle line:10%
I did that at least twice a day.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.180 align:middle line:10%
I walked.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.410 align:middle line:10%
I got out in nature.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.590 align:middle line:10%
I got in the sun.

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I destressed as
much as possible.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.630 align:middle line:10%
And one other thing,
too, that was important

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:53.650 align:middle line:10%
was that, unfortunately, I
had to remove some friends,

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.710 align:middle line:10%
because they were very
negative about what I was doing

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.200 align:middle line:10%
and to the point where it
kind of would keep me upset

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.460 align:middle line:10%
sometimes.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.500 align:middle line:10%
So I knew it
wouldn't be forever.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.810 align:middle line:10%
But it was just something
that had to be done.

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.090 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't just go up
to them and say, you know,

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:08.680 align:middle line:10%
"I can't be your
friend anymore."

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.540 align:middle line:10%
I just didn't go
around them as much.

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.350 align:middle line:10%
And so that helped also.

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:19.510 align:middle line:10%
So I knew that if I
was going to do this,

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:23.620 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to give it every
chance I could to work.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
be half-hearted.

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You made a
radical decision.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LANPHIER: I did.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.145 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: You got rid of everything
that wasn't supporting you.

00:53:30.145 --> 00:53:31.437 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: I was very serious.

00:53:31.437 --> 00:53:33.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And you changed
your entire way of living,

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.085 align:middle line:10%
right down to wearing gloves
when you didn't used to

00:53:36.085 --> 00:53:37.570 align:middle line:10%
and getting rid
of your toothpaste

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.660 align:middle line:10%
to just shucking everything
that didn't support you.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.790 align:middle line:10%
And you made a
decision for yourself

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:46.270 align:middle line:10%
and began to be proactive in
creating the environment that

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:48.130 align:middle line:10%
was going to help you heal.

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.605 align:middle line:10%
Is that what I'm getting?

00:53:49.605 --> 00:53:50.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: That's
exactly right.

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.060 align:middle line:10%
I was very serious about it.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:58.210 align:middle line:10%
And I know to a lot of people
I sounded very militant.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:00.250 align:middle line:10%
I got that, you know?

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:04.420 align:middle line:10%
But I didn't care,
because it was my life.

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.195 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Am I getting that
it was in the line of you

00:54:07.195 --> 00:54:10.070 align:middle line:10%
or in the light of you just
making a choice for yourself?

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:12.970 align:middle line:10%
And so while it looked
militant from the outside,

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:15.457 align:middle line:10%
it felt like a big
yes on the inside?

00:54:15.457 --> 00:54:16.540 align:middle line:10%
Is that what we're saying?

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:16.870 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Absolutely.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:18.550 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Because faith is amazing.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:22.032 align:middle line:10%
And you got into action
in relation to that.

00:54:22.032 --> 00:54:23.240 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.970 align:middle line:10%
I had done some reading
before we went to Dr. Group.

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:30.100 align:middle line:10%
And as I was reading
about what people

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.850 align:middle line:10%
had done who had healed from
cancer using natural medicine,

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.920 align:middle line:10%
I would think, I can do that.

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.950 align:middle line:10%
I can do that.

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:38.290 align:middle line:10%
You know, I can do that.

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:40.900 align:middle line:10%
And really, it does
sound militant.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.110 align:middle line:10%
But I want to tell you, when
you're fighting for your life,

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:46.360 align:middle line:10%
and you're wanting to
do it without toxins,

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.210 align:middle line:10%
and you're wanting to do
it to where you don't have

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:52.420 align:middle line:10%
to worry about the future,
having heart disease

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:56.170 align:middle line:10%
or anything like that, because
you did chemotherapy, it

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:57.610 align:middle line:10%
was worth it to me.

00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:00.790 align:middle line:10%
I had to take a
couple of steps back.

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:06.880 align:middle line:10%
And as a mom, you learn to think
of everybody else but yourself.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:11.110 align:middle line:10%
And I had to take some steps
back and say, this time

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:15.290 align:middle line:10%
in my life, this short period
of time, I have to focus on me.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:21.580 align:middle line:10%
I have to be militant enough
to get well and to do it 24/7

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:24.820 align:middle line:10%
until I am well, until
I hear those words.

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:25.930 align:middle line:10%
And I prayed every night.

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:10%
God, I just want
to hear your will.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.160 align:middle line:10%
And eventually--

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:30.960 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.850 align:middle line:10%
And what was your prognosis?

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:36.685 align:middle line:10%
What was your prognosis
with stage III cancer?

00:55:36.685 --> 00:55:40.120 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Well, they didn't
pronounce a prognosis over me

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:45.430 align:middle line:10%
other than I asked my
oncologist point blank one day.

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:50.250 align:middle line:10%
I said, "So what
are my chances?"

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I
was ready to hear

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.610 align:middle line:90%
a percentage, is what it was.

00:55:54.610 --> 00:56:01.200 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "Well, you have
a 30% chance of it not coming

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.850 align:middle line:10%
back," which in my mind meant
I had a 70% chance of it coming

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:09.780 align:middle line:10%
back, even doing this
horrendous chemotherapy.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.370 align:middle line:10%
That didn't make sense to me.

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:13.620 align:middle line:10%
To me, it was not
common sense to continue

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.400 align:middle line:10%
doing something that
was most likely not only

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.250 align:middle line:10%
had the ability to take my
life but my immune system

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:23.700 align:middle line:10%
and anything that
could help me get well,

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.910 align:middle line:10%
that was the healing
mechanisms in my body.

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:31.330 align:middle line:10%
And I've seen this over
and over with people.

00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.280 align:middle line:10%
They don't think
there's anything else

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.290 align:middle line:10%
to do or to help them.

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:39.040 align:middle line:10%
So they're willing to take
that huge percentage chance.

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.880 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't willing to,
because I had no life.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.450 align:middle line:10%
Why live your life in
a recliner, you know?

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:49.780 align:middle line:10%
Because if you move,
you're so nauseous,

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.610 align:middle line:10%
you just cannot
do anything else.

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And I know it was a--
don't get me wrong.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.500 align:middle line:10%
It was a huge step
out of the box for me.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.990 align:middle line:10%
I was ready to do it.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:02.710 align:middle line:10%
But at the same time, it was not
something that I was used to.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:05.080 align:middle line:10%
And when we finally
did it, and I finally

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.360 align:middle line:10%
got into the protocol,
and I finally

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:13.480 align:middle line:10%
started feeling better, looking
better, having energy and even

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.250 align:middle line:10%
self-confidence, who
doesn't want that?

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:18.370 align:middle line:10%
You know, who doesn't want that?

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:21.610 align:middle line:10%
And it was just something
else to underline

00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:23.830 align:middle line:10%
to me that what I
was doing was what

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:26.090 align:middle line:10%
I was supposed to be doing.

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:27.430 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And here you are.

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:28.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: And here I am--

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:28.430 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Cancer-free?

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:29.638 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: --20 years later.

00:57:29.638 --> 00:57:32.970 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: 20 years later,
cancer-free, healthy.

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: No recurrences.

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Strong?

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.240 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Strong.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.280 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Loving your life?

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Love what I do.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.220 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely love it.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:46.480 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Group saw that I had
developed such an interest

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.880 align:middle line:10%
for natural and
alternative medicine.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.270 align:middle line:10%
I mean, when I was
working with him,

00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:57.430 align:middle line:10%
I saw people walk in our office
downhearted with whatever

00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:01.420 align:middle line:10%
diagnosis they had at the
time, just not feeling good.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.458 align:middle line:10%
And just with a session with
him, they would walk out.

00:58:04.458 --> 00:58:06.250 align:middle line:10%
They had a little bit
of pep in their step,

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:07.350 align:middle line:10%
if you know what I'm saying.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.150 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:09.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Because
he was giving

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:14.510 align:middle line:10%
them hope that, yes,
you can get well.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Loretta, from the time
you started with Dr. Group

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:22.020 align:middle line:84%
until the time that you were
cancer-free, what kind of frame

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:22.820 align:middle line:90%
lapsed there?

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.250 align:middle line:84%
How much time was
that in your life?

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:30.060 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: So I was diagnosed
in September of 2000.

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.140 align:middle line:10%
And I had surgery.

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.260 align:middle line:10%
I did my four chemo treatments.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:39.070 align:middle line:10%
I saw a Dr. Group the first
week in February of 2001.

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:43.050 align:middle line:10%
By the middle of August,
I was cancer free.

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:45.780 align:middle line:10%
Now I would-- just let me say
this, because a lot of people

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.490 align:middle line:10%
will say, "Well, you
did chemotherapy.

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:48.290 align:middle line:10%
You had surgery.

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:50.310 align:middle line:10%
That's why you're cancer-free."

00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:52.350 align:middle line:10%
After three months of
doing his protocol,

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:58.420 align:middle line:10%
we did a test, a test for cancer
cells it measures in the blood.

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:04.020 align:middle line:10%
Mine came back on
the low side of high.

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was really disappointed,
because I thought, man, I'm

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:07.990 align:middle line:90%
doing so much.

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.790 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:10.630 align:middle line:10%
I was discouraged.

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:13.610 align:middle line:10%
And so he got on the phone
with me, and I said, "Well,

00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:14.610 align:middle line:10%
what are we going to do?

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:15.420 align:middle line:10%
What do we do now?"

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.140 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I was
panicked, you know?

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:19.260 align:middle line:10%
And I expected him to
say the same thing.

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:20.650 align:middle line:10%
"Well, let me think about it."

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.140 align:middle line:10%
You know what he said?

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.030 align:middle line:10%
"We're going to keep
doing what we're doing."

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:27.770 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, what?

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:29.070 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "You know what?

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.110 align:middle line:10%
I think your numbers
are going down."

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:35.290 align:middle line:10%
Well, with my
negativity, you know,

00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:36.760 align:middle line:10%
I didn't even think about that.

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.110 align:middle line:10%
I didn't think that
was a possibility.

00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:40.170 align:middle line:10%
And you know what?

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:42.603 align:middle line:10%
He was right.

00:59:42.603 --> 00:59:44.020 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Thank you
so much, Loretta,

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:48.700 align:middle line:10%
for sharing this amazing
insight into taking things

00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:51.100 align:middle line:10%
into your own hands
with the guidance

00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:54.430 align:middle line:10%
of some secure information
that is allowing

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:58.940 align:middle line:10%
you to make smart choices to
claim healing in your own life.

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.020 align:middle line:10%
I think that this will be a
wonderful help to lots and lots

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.157 align:middle line:10%
of people.

01:00:03.157 --> 01:00:05.240 align:middle line:10%
>>LANPHIER: Thank you so
much for the opportunity.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.560 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Thank you for
your time, my dear.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.000 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.350 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what is the
most common mistake

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:16.720 align:middle line:84%
that people make when they're
trying to begin to detox?

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.670 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
gets in people's way

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:21.520 align:middle line:84%
from being successful
in this process?

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Just actually
their environment.

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
If they don't have
supportive friends,

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
if they don't have
supportive family members,

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:32.560 align:middle line:84%
if they're not
educated enough as

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to the process of the
detoxification program

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that they're going through,
that can get in their way.

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Work could get in their way.

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for somebody to, first
of all, make that decision.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again,
why it's so important

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to give those individuals
the hope and the faith

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and the education as to what
to expect when they start

01:00:55.450 --> 01:00:58.150 align:middle line:90%
their detoxification program.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
That's also why you start them
off slowly and methodically

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.650 align:middle line:90%
when you're detoxifying them.

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:05.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're going to
start them always with--

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:07.180 align:middle line:90%
all disease starts in the gut.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.400 align:middle line:84%
All health begins in
the gut, you know?

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you really
explain that to them.

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:16.095 align:middle line:84%
You start them off in
that cleansing process.

01:01:16.095 --> 01:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, you're also

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
educating them
about how to change

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
their external
environment as well.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You know, I think this
is an important topic, this gut

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
health thing, 'cause there's
a lot of conversation

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
about leaky gut and
gut health, et cetera.

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Can you just recap
that for us and just

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
drop it down for
people to really

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
be clear on, what
does gut health mean,

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.203 align:middle line:84%
and how do I know
if I have it or not?

01:01:38.203 --> 01:01:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So
interesting questions.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So we did a lot of
research on that

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and found that there's got to
be something in the gut that's

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.160 align:middle line:84%
controlling all of the
things and all of the systems

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
pathways in the body.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we started looking at
the different areas of the gut.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we stumbled
upon the appendix.

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:57.728 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we went to look at
the research on the appendix,

01:01:57.728 --> 01:02:00.195 align:middle line:84%
medical science still
says they don't even

01:02:00.195 --> 01:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
know what the appendix is,
and they just rip it out

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.360 align:middle line:90%
whenever it's inflamed.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We actually found research
from Germany and in Russia

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
that we had to have translated
that the appendix is actually

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:12.760 align:middle line:90%
the brain in the body.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The appendix is about
the size of your pinky.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And we know now that the
appendix controls pH.

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a relay station.

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:21.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the analysis.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the microchip.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And why wouldn't the
microchip be located

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.920 align:middle line:90%
in the intestinal tract, right?

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.100 align:middle line:84%
That's where all your
water's coming in.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.020 align:middle line:84%
That's where all your minerals,
your vitamins, your nutrients,

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.570 align:middle line:90%
your proteins, your fats.

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:35.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that tells--

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.650 align:middle line:84%
the appendix actually
gives and sends signals

01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
to the lymphatic system, to
the cardiovascular system,

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:44.540 align:middle line:84%
what nutrients are going to
be available to the brain.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So the appendix is a vital
part of how the intestines work

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and how gut health is so
important, is that it really

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
is the starting point for how
everything else in the body

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.140 align:middle line:90%
functions and operates.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So I study bioenergetics.

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the knowings is that
billions of bits of information

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
are bombarding our energy
field every millisecond,

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and they don't report to the
brain, they report to the gut,

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and that this information
is then translated up

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
through our filtering system
so that we become conscious

01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:19.600 align:middle line:90%
of this universal intelligence.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying
on the physical level

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the
same thing, that we

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
are transmitting and translating
information constantly.

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And so now what do we
say to somebody who's

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.690 align:middle line:90%
had their appendix removed?

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
What do we say to
this individual?

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:36.538 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, there's what
we call phantom appendix.

01:03:36.538 --> 01:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
You know phantom limbs, where
you get your leg cut off,

01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and they can still feel
their feet, because it's

01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:41.720 align:middle line:90%
the energy signature?

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy field
that's still there.

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So in cases where people have
their gallbladder removed,

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.610 align:middle line:84%
for example, or their
appendix removed,

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
we feel that you just need to
take more care of your gut.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.860 align:middle line:90%
You need to be aware of that.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.980 align:middle line:84%
The way the body
reads energy, you'll

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:03.040 align:middle line:84%
still have that
there, as well as

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.750 align:middle line:84%
if you have your
gallbladder taken out,

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
which I consider it part
of the digestive system,

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.280 align:middle line:84%
then the liver will have
to take on excess work.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's more
important to just make

01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:19.070 align:middle line:84%
sure that you cleanse your liver
on a regular basis as well.

01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We found, actually-- we've done
hundreds of thousands of liver

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
cleanses over the
last 20 years--

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
that the majority of the
population right now,

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
their livers are only
functioning at about 15%.

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
This is how congested and
clogged people's livers

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
are with stones, with
flukes, with just congestion,

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.740 align:middle line:90%
fatty tissue.

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease in kids

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.590 align:middle line:90%
that are eating fatty diets.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, the liver is just--

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
it's such a vital
organ that needs to be

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.610 align:middle line:90%
cleansed on a regular basis.

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
We've had testimonials of
individuals that have just

01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:59.720 align:middle line:84%
done nothing but liver cleanses
back to back-- done 15,

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
20 liver cleanses-- that their
conditions have completely

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.310 align:middle line:90%
gone away.

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And for that matter,
with all cleansing,

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
again, it's just getting the
body's self-healing mechanism

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to operate again and removing
the amount of chemicals

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and toxins that are
suppressing the body's

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:18.200 align:middle line:90%
self-healing mechanism.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Exactly.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Boy, time goes so fast.

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.107 align:middle line:90%
This is an amazing conversation.

01:05:22.107 --> 01:05:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled to be
having it with you.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Just one more thing.

01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:27.740 align:middle line:84%
What is the most exciting
thing that you're

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.200 align:middle line:90%
working with right now?

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Or what are you looking
forward to delving into more?

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Energetics.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I've been really involved in
the quantum energetic field

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:40.910 align:middle line:90%
and studying Paracelsus' work.

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I've been working on a project
for 10 years where we can

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
capture the energetics of
the herbs-- in other words,

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
do a raw herbal
extraction process--

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and have, working
with Dr. Glen Rein,

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
who's now able to measure
quantum energy fields

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and conductivity to a higher
level than Kirlian photography

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:01.010 align:middle line:90%
would be.

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
But bringing a high
energetic compound

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
using combinations of
herbs or single herbs,

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:12.320 align:middle line:84%
but doing it in a way
where you're taking

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.380 align:middle line:90%
the plant as if Paracelsus did.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.410 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, people knew
about this kind of thing

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:20.210 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been
lost or suppressed.

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Tesla knew a lot
about energetics.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel we're going into
a whole quantum energy

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
shift in consciousness and to
be able to infuse quantum energy

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.860 align:middle line:90%
patterns as well in water.

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:37.580 align:middle line:10%
We've been working on a
hydrofusion water system, where

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.250 align:middle line:10%
we take a
triple-distilled water,

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:42.470 align:middle line:10%
and we're able to infuse
it with light frequencies,

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:46.670 align:middle line:10%
sound frequencies, as well as
any other type of frequencies

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.320 align:middle line:10%
that someone might need.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Magnetics, working
with paramagnetics,

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
using paramagnetic
frequencies-- basically,

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.780 align:middle line:84%
taking different
types of energy fields

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.580 align:middle line:84%
or balancing out different type
of energy fields in the body,

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.800 align:middle line:90%
however you want to do that.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's kind of the next
phase that we're looking into.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.850 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it with herbs.

01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Do I think it needs
to be done with herbs?

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I think there's going to be
a point that we'll reach,

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
which is a lot of the basis
of what you've been doing

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.190 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, where all
the successes that you've

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
had as well, where
we're teaching people

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:20.150 align:middle line:90%
how to become aware.

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
We're teaching the
awareness, the consciousness,

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
how to become aware and
utilize the energies that they

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
currently have
within their systems.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.008 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Different use of the
mind, as you were saying,

01:07:31.008 --> 01:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
the mind as our
most powerful tool.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much for your
brilliance and your expertise

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:36.890 align:middle line:90%
today.

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It's been an amazing
conversation.

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.910 align:middle line:10%
And we are blessed to
be awakened in every way

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:42.710 align:middle line:10%
that we can.

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:45.835 align:middle line:84%
And you're certainly serving
humanity in an amazing way.

>>GROUP: Well, thanks
for having me on.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure,
and it's an honor.

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank you so much.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.580 align:middle line:84%
We all have the
ability to trigger

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.930 align:middle line:90%
our own self-healing mechanism.

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:57.680 align:middle line:10%
If we do at least one
thing to detox our lives,

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.520 align:middle line:10%
we make a step forward in taking
back control of our health.
