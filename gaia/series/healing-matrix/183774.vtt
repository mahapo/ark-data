00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us,
in your own words,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
what happened in Hemberg,
Switzerland with this tower?

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:10%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Well, this was
the first public, large project

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:10%
that I did.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:10%
I was very reluctant to do
it because, for many years,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:10%
I've been doing sort of projects
with different governments that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:10%
were always high
security projects.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So I just had to
face my own results,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't have
to face the public.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:10%
And then, in Switzerland,
they had this huge problem

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:10%
where the residents
of Hemberg wanted

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:10%
to dynamite the mobile towers.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So the government asked
me to go and help.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
Now, their idea was
you should change

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
the effect without touching
the cause, you see?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, logic says that if
something is harming you,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:90%
you take away the cause.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And I told them,
this is the logic.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And they said, why do
you think we bring you.

asked me, how will you do it?

I said, don't ask me
because it's not logical.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:90%
So let me do it.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I went there.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Hemberg, I was
really touched by the people

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:84%
There was a lady who
was shouting and crying

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
because she had three
children, 8, 10, and 12.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And each one of the children
had five epileptic fits a day.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:90%
So she had to deal with 15 fits.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So she was shouting
at the government,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
take off those towers or I'll
go myself and dynamite them

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:90%
The cows were not fertile.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And so many symptoms
there were happening.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I told them, we
will find a solution here.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
What made me get
closer to those people

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:84%
is that I showed
them in their barns

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
where they had
their animals, they

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:84%
knew I could identify
Earth's radiation.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Because all the farmers
and all those people

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:84%
understand energy through
Earth's radiation.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So when I showed
them I could do it,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:90%
now, we were on speaking terms.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:90%

problems are, then

00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:90%
you have your own solution.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:84%
They said, no, we
know how to find them.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:90%
But we can't solve the problem.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, I'll
solve it for you.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I started putting shapes
together and all that.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the whole community

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
was there, fascinated
with my work, helping me.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was taking
me into his home,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
showing me every
problem in his home.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And we corrected them.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.450 align:middle line:90%
And a sort of euphoria happened.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Everybody-- everything
changed there.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:90%
So we installed our shapes.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Within a day or two, they came
back very happy in the morning,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%

00:09:06.582 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: But
when they went out,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
it's again-- because
there was a town nearby

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that had electronic games
and things like that.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So when those
children went there,

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:90%
they got their fits there.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was I gave
them things to wear.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Like a ring, or a medallion,
or a bracelet, or something

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:90%
to wear.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were happy
to wear those things.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And when they went
there, then they were OK.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little episode
of this eight-year-old child

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:90%
who had five fits a day.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I went to his house
with his mother.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was wearing a ring, a
BioGeometry designed ring.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at my
hand and said, I--

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:90%
I am OK.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:90%
My head is free now.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And I want this.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to take my ring.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And she told him,
it's our guest.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Please--

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Don't take his jewelry.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: No, no.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Is your head OK?

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:90%
So I covered this.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK?

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:90%
No, now my head--

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.440 align:middle line:90%
I have this tension again.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK?

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes, is-- again.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:90%
So I told him, OK.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
The next day, I brought
a small bracelet for him.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.702 align:middle line:84%
And he wore it and
his head was cleared.

00:10:23.702 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
That's how we made bracelets
for all the epileptic children

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:84%
there so that they
can go out and they

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have a problem.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But Hemberg changed the
whole outlook of everybody

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:90%
in Switzerland.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So the director of Swisscom,
they asked him on TV,

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
do you now acknowledge that
there is something called

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:90%
electro hypersensibility?

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:10%
That was years before
the WTO acknowledged it.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes, we
now acknowledge it.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, so
you know it exists?

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.953 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes, we know it exists.

00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
brought you the solution.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Once they had the solution,
then they acknowledged.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think Hemberg was like the
first project done in public.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It was all over the media
everywhere in Switzerland.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And some people, for example,
a very prominent psychologist

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:84%
in a conference came
out and said, oh, you

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't believe
this Egyptian that he

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:90%
has a new science or something.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Because there exists
in history people who

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:90%
have tremendous power.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:90%
So he's Egyptian.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:84%
He might have some temporal
sciences or have some things.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And he can go into a region
and then everybody is healed.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But this is a collective
placebo effect.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.952 align:middle line:90%
So it's not science.

00:11:46.952 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:90%
The science is only covering.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:90%
You know, he was trying to be--

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he didn't like
what was happening.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So one lady stood
up from Hemberg.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And she said, sir, our
cows don't speak Arabic.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.791 align:middle line:90%
That answers that.

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:06.583 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That's all I
have to say about that.

00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yeah,
cows don't speak Arabic.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: We actually
did, like, a TEDx talk in Egypt

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.205 align:middle line:90%
called "Why is The Cow Smiling."

00:12:12.205 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And he went back
explaining how if it

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:84%
wasn't for the cows, and
the animals, that all of it

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.623 align:middle line:84%
would have just been put
aside as some kind of--

00:12:22.623 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Psychosomatic--

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Yeah.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Psychosomatic issue.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.345 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Yeah.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So I
told them in my speech,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
instead of me speaking,
the cow in Switzerland

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
asked me to speak on her
behalf because she feels,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't for her, all my
science it would be placebo.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, I speak on
her behalf, you know.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at what some
of the other people of Hemberg

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:90%
have been saying as well.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.905 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yes.

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank you.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSEMARIE KELLER:
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The Hemberg
project was so successful

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that the Swiss
government and Swisscom

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
offered another
commission to Dr. Karim.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
the town of Hirschberg.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Hirschberg, Switzerland
offered you a whole country

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:90%
solution.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.800 align:middle line:84%
You offered them a solution
to a country-wide issue.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that experience.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.445 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
Well, Hirschberg

00:16:58.445 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
was actually a pilot project
for a total country solution

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
because in Hemberg
we installed those

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:90%
shapes in the mobile towers.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, they were not happy to
go with a complete country

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:84%
solution with the shapes
pointing at the mobile towers

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
it might be understood

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:84%
as correcting the harm
done by the mobile towers.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So they told me, let's
take a second place

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
to make a pilot project where
you give a solution where you

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.850 align:middle line:90%
don't use the mobile towers.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So I got the geometric shapes,
like these, a bit bigger,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:90%
double in size.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I put them in plastic
tubes filled with water,

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
closed them, and came
at the central spot.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a valley that has
about 10 kilometers radius.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's a 20 kilometer
valley like that

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:90%
with mountains at the end.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's a small
hill in the middle.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
central place and got

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
12 of those different
shapes, each one targeting

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:90%
a different thing.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:84%
One electro-smog, one
underground water,

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:90%
one Earth's radiation.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So each one dealt
with one thing.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I buried the 12 tubes in
the central area in Hirschberg.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
The project was so successful,
even better than the first one.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
the pilot project.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So I was offered a complete--
a whole country contract

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%
to do all of Switzerland.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
At that time, by the time I
was offered that contract,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.172 align:middle line:90%
I had immigrated--

00:18:44.172 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I was living in
Switzerland, first.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I immigrated to Canada,
where the Doreya

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.540 align:middle line:90%
went to study at university.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to go
into a German university.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
She told me that language
too difficult for me.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Take me somewhere
because she was

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:90%
in an American school in Egypt.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So we all went, the whole
family immigrated to Canada.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And there were some political
problems and things like that

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, taxes and things
that related to the contract

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:90%
before I even signed it.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't want headaches
and things like that.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
When I found things coming
to a clash with authorities

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
about taxes, money, tax
evasion, things like that.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.270 align:middle line:90%
So I said no, better just--

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.145 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: No, thank you.

00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: No, thank you.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.030 align:middle line:90%
And I refused it.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And it came out in
the official document

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that came out that I had to
refuse the contract because

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
of personal reasons
because I immigrated.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't do it then, yeah.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It is still pending, but yeah.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So with all of this
and the obvious relationship

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:84%
between the telecommunications
antennas, the issues,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:84%
the towers, and the
effect on this community,

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
what does this say
about our future

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
with the increased
telecommunication antenna

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
need and the electric power
and our advancements of driving

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
electric cars and these
attempts that we're

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
making in one
direction, what does

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.867 align:middle line:90%
it say in the whole picture?

00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: You see--

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: I think--

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: OK.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:90%
You go ahead.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: No, like,
I'm sorry to cut you off.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to add
that part of BioGeometry

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
is when we look at how
technology comes about,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:84%
so let's say we look
at a car, right.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
If the car had been studied
against human health,

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:90%
we would have--

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.690 align:middle line:84%
would we have a car that is
polluting the environment as

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
much as it's polluting today?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Would you have like how you
have the air pollution in China

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:90%
because of all of the traffic?

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:84%
We have the same
problem in Egypt.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:84%
If they had studied it and
taken into account human health,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:90%
we're going to--

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.088 align:middle line:84%
from a BioGeometry perspective,
we would say not just human

00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:56.642 align:middle line:84%
health, but human health in a
multi-dimensional human subtle

00:20:56.642 --> 00:20:57.475 align:middle line:90%
energy perspective--

00:20:57.475 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Would you
still have cars today?

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Would you have cars
today that are affecting

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
the environment and
our lungs the way

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:90%
that they're affecting us today?

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: No.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: So it actually,
from a BioGeometry perspective,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
we look at the same thing
with electromagnetic radiation

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:90%
and cell phone technology.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.177 align:middle line:10%
Do you need to completely
stop electromagnetic radiation

00:21:21.177 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:10%
and cell phone technology?

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:10%
He already touched upon the
fact that it's impossible.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Reduction
isn't a solution.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But can you take the
human being into account?

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is you
have to because you--

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and, also, you brought
up electric cars.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And he always talks
about electric cars.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So we've moved
away from pollution

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to a car that, OK, is
better for the environment,

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.720 align:middle line:84%
but, because of
the electro-smog,

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
needs a solution in
order for it to not

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
be harmful to your health
and your energy system.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Your vital force.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: I know you
have so much to add here.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: No,
I mean, and imagine

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:90%
sitting in electric cars.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I've measured cars
while charging,

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
while recharging them,
and the disturbing field

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:84%
went about four meters
away from the car,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.580 align:middle line:84%
the human body
detects it already

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:90%
before coming into the cars.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you come near the
car, it starts getting worse.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Inside the car, every organ
of your body starts to have--

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:90%
to be under stress.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: And
so you are putting

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:84%
a person inside a highly
charged electromagnetic cocoon

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And what will happen
is it, with time,

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
it will affect not
only health, it

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
will affect concentration
of the drivers.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Accidents will increase or
fatigue and things like this.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So we have started developing
BioGeometry solutions

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.935 align:middle line:84%
to transform it so that the
electric car becomes actually

00:23:01.935 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
a harmonizing element, a healing
aspect in the electric car.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So when you sit in
the electric car,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:84%
you are actually getting
a healing session.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So you stay alert while
driving, but at the same time,

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:90%
very relaxed.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And you drive with no
fatigue and things like that.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So it is very, very
dangerous to go

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.300 align:middle line:84%
with the roadway of
electricity and electric cars,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:84%
or in smart cities
where electricity

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:84%
or electromagnetic
radiation is everywhere.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go into this form
of pollution without having

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:90%
a solution for it.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
it took us, now,

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
100 years until we
start discovering

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
that fossil fuels and oil
and gases are harmful to us.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't have another 100 years
with electromagnetic radiation.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.262 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:24:01.262 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: We will end
civilization much before that.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: And just to--

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So let's wake
up now and find the solution.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.353 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Just to add
as well, because we do focus

00:24:09.353 --> 00:24:11.722 align:middle line:84%
on modern technology,
but going back again,

00:24:11.722 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand BioGeometry
is a design language.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And I doubt we have
time to get into this.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But also, for example, it's
not just modern technology.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Modern technology
we need to address.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you even look
at something as simple

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
as a classroom shape.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that we
found in Bio Geometry

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
is we looked at is a rectangle
or a square classroom

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:84%
shape beneficial or
not to a student?

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
found that it is not

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.020 align:middle line:84%
beneficial from a subtle energy
perspective to a child who's

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:90%
trying to learn.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
we actually

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
found that by
changing that shape

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
from a square or a rectangle
to more of an octagonal shape,

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:84%
you're actually helping relieve
stress off of the student.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And we found that this--
we worked with the Autistic

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Society in Cairo to
help with children

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
with some of these
symptoms of autism

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
just by changing
the classroom shape.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's just another example
of even modern technology,

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:90%
such as--

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
we talk about electromagnetic
radiation, but even

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:90%
your built structures.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has
a shape to it, you

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.760 align:middle line:84%
have to study the effect
on the subtle energy system

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and everything
has a shape to it.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And everything
has a shape.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Yeah.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you know, what I
know everyone wants to see

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:84%
is we have some tools
here, we have some things.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
We want to see
what's going on here.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with us how
you implement BioGeometry

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.060 align:middle line:84%
in this world,
making it tangible,

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:84%
measurable with cause and effect
and ability to have an effect,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:90%
creative force in action.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
Well, first, you

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
should know that subtle
energy is energy that moves.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:84%
When you move something,
it's like ripples.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, ripples are kind of
compression waves like that,

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.880 align:middle line:90%
very similar to sound waves.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But there are so
many other levels.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So we can call super sound
type, whatever, inaudible sound.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's this type of energy.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, I ask myself,
how do I interact

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:90%
with this subtle energy?

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I have something in my
architecture practice

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
in which I interact with
it, not with subtle energy

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:84%
on those high levels, but
to subtle energy on lower

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:84%
levels that is at resonance
with those levels.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's, for example,
in acoustics and sound.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I design theaters,
so I use shape

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to somehow work
with subtle energy.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So I can change the quality
of sound using shape.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Sure.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
In aerodynamics, I

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
shape my cars and all that to
interact with the subtle energy

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.440 align:middle line:90%
movement of the air.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So shapes
are the tools of interacting

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:90%
with subtle energy.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Antennas and wavelengths
are the tools

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
electromagnetic energy.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:90%
But this energy, use shapes.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if we want to
program that background

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:18.780 align:middle line:84%
energy because subtle energy
is 99% of the background energy

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like a carpet weave
in the background that

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.140 align:middle line:84%
has all the levels,
from vitality, emotion,

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and mental, all of
those, are out there.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.702 align:middle line:84%
This is the carpet
weave in the background.

00:27:30.702 --> 00:27:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's just there.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:90%
You don't notice it.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: It's there.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.328 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's just
holding the space.

00:27:34.328 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So you
have to have shapes.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And a design language
means you have

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:84%
to have shapes that
you can program

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to have this effect on the
emotional level, that effect

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:84%
on the mental
level, that effect--

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
so it's a language
of programming shapes

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what shapes
affect what level.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:10%
So once you know what
shapes affect that level,

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:10%
you have the tools in your
hands of creating shapes

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:07.410 align:middle line:10%
where you can balance
the emotional level

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.210 align:middle line:10%
in the environment.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are an
open energy system,

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
so me and the
environment are one.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:19.630 align:middle line:84%
If air is polluted, I breathe
it, I'm sick, or vise versa.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So now, in the environment,
I have this interaction.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
With any level in
the environment,

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.493 align:middle line:84%
if I can balance the
emotion level automatically

00:28:33.493 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
balance at the emotional
level of all living systems

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:90%
living in it.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we are part
of that environment.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So we take our shapes,
we program the shapes.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
example of shapes,

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:84%
how we can program some
shapes like that, in order

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:90%
to make them emit energy.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, what kind of
energy is emitted?

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
These interact with the
subtle energy out there.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, take it and it
introduces balance and harmony

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.060 align:middle line:90%
into them.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
That means it's introducing the
qualities of sacred power spots

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and radiates it back
into the environment.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So BioGeometry is recreating
the energy quality

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
of a sacred power spot
in the subtle energy

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.630 align:middle line:84%
of the environment
on all levels.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.303 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you're emitting
this standing wave.

00:29:33.303 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yeah.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.185 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're emitting
this harmonic presence--

00:29:37.185 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yes.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.925 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --into a
disharmony of some sort.

00:29:40.925 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yes.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And
rearranging it because

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:90%
of what you're projecting.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.907 align:middle line:10%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: You should look
at the energy of a sacred power

00:29:46.907 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:10%
spot, not as a
quality in itself,

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:10%
but as the centering quality
that takes all of the qualities

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:10%
and balances them.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you call
the centering quality.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what types
of environmental issues

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:90%
are impacted by the use here?

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.747 align:middle line:90%
You know, if you're--

00:30:07.747 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Everything can.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So give us a few.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.850 align:middle line:90%
List them off.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Well, like we
talked about, geopathic stress.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:10%
>>DOREYA KARIM: You know,
we talked a little bit

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.480 align:middle line:10%
about electromagnetic
radiation, modern technology.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:17.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:10%
>>DOREYA KARIM: One thing we
didn't mention is that maybe--

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.930 align:middle line:10%
or maybe we did.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But that all of these
things are actually

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.238 align:middle line:90%
in a type of resonance.

00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:24.320 align:middle line:90%
They amplify each other.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look at the
environment as a whole.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.758 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: But
I also think that one

00:30:28.758 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful
things about BioGeometry

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:37.010 align:middle line:84%
is there is a difference between
having a space where you've

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:84%
remediated certain problems
versus having a centered space.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So the wonderful thing
about BioGeometry

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:84%
is we actually go in
with a positive approach

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:51.440 align:middle line:84%
where if you can recreate the
energy of a sacred power spot,

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:84%
then you will have
a centered space.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:84%
You can have a space
where, like we said,

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.420 align:middle line:84%
you can move your bed
off geopathic stress.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you
have a centered space.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: So we
focus on getting that space

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.240 align:middle line:84%
to actually balance
your body, to get

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.812 align:middle line:84%
that space to work not
only, like we said,

00:31:12.812 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:84%
with that centering
system and work

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:18.260 align:middle line:84%
on that multidimensional
emotional mental level,

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:84%
but you will have a space
that will evolve with you

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.080 align:middle line:90%
as the environment evolves.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.030 align:middle line:84%
In the sense of let's
say I moved your bed off

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.010 align:middle line:90%
of a geopathic stress line.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, somebody actually
came and put like a router right

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:90%
on that line.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.470 align:middle line:84%
That router could actually
amplify the stress

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:90%
from that line.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, the bed, even
though we moved it off,

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.300 align:middle line:90%
it still could be affected.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.442 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: But if
you have a centered space,

00:31:45.442 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:84%
if you can manage to recreate
the energy of the sacred power

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.080 align:middle line:84%
spot in your home, then
it will move with you.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It will work on that
environmental exchange level.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.915 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then, the same
thing with the body, as well.

00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yes.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you were
demonstrating some things

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.382 align:middle line:84%
with the mannequin that I would
love for our viewers to see.

00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:06.465 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: OK, but--

00:32:06.465 --> 00:32:07.265 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Before I do that, I just
want to explain one thing.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Geometrical shapes that effect
subtle energy are not new.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:22.310 align:middle line:84%
There are many,
many institutions

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.360 align:middle line:84%
around the world
who practice that.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So OK, what's
so difference with BioGeometry

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:90%
that is--

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.560 align:middle line:84%
it's not the same
as any one of those.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.140 align:middle line:84%
If you emit a certain
quality of energy

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:84%
through geometrical
shapes, you are

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:84%
playing the role of a
healer, emitting a equality.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And unless you managed to
sort of dosage it properly,

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.130 align:middle line:84%
you're creating the
big problems that

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.110 align:middle line:90%
happen with geometrical shapes.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Bio
Geometry, you don't--

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.320 align:middle line:90%
you are not the healer.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.790 align:middle line:90%
You are the doorman, as I said.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You open and let the
balancing quality come out,

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:84%
create the sacred
power spot, connect it

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.590 align:middle line:84%
to higher dimensions,
let the higher

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:90%
dimensions do the healing.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:90%
You are not the healer.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember,
you are the doorman.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This is the only true
healing that is I ever real.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:21.126 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yes.

00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:22.910 align:middle line:90%
This is the only true healing.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, let us-- you spoke
about the human body.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
It's very simple
to understand there

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
is a secret in the
shape of the human body.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.720 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
contain water, you

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.972 align:middle line:84%
would have to make a
sort of a cup shape

00:33:40.972 --> 00:33:41.930 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:84%
If you have a flat shape,
you can't contain water.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So the container has
to be shaped in order

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.360 align:middle line:90%
to house the content.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if the content is
on the subtle energy level,

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:84%
it's not on a
physical level at all.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And we want to make
a container that

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.470 align:middle line:84%
can house vitality,
emotional energy, life

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:84%
forces, mental energy,
spiritual energy.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do I make a physical
container that can actually

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.820 align:middle line:90%
have all those things in it?

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:84%
The only way to house that
is through entering with it

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:90%
into resonance.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.515 align:middle line:90%
Resonance like music a string.

00:34:21.515 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:90%
It builds an echo between them.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.429 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
exchange of information

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that means you contain
it by resonating with it.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do I achieve resonance?

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, music achieves
resonance with the universe.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But I design every aspect,
geometrically, in such a way

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.969 align:middle line:84%
to enter into resonance
with each one of the levels.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So the body can
enter into resonance,

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
which each one of
the emotional levels,

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.840 align:middle line:84%
multiple emotional
levels, it has

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.000 align:middle line:84%
shapes that enter into resonance
with the mental levels.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And we've spent years studying
those shapes of the body.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And out of it, we've come out
with the individual shapes

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:90%
that affect each level.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, that means that the body
is able, through its design,

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.560 align:middle line:90%
to contain everything in there.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, the body is a
manifestation of divinity.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.387 align:middle line:84%
That's where I was going to
go with what you were saying.

00:35:24.387 --> 00:35:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Is it that the body that emits
the energy or is the body

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.590 align:middle line:90%
a byproduct of the energy--

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: It's both.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Because in resonance--

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: --the
information goes both ways.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So is
the body the container

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.070 align:middle line:84%
or is the body
the manifestation?

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And the answer is yes.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.495 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: And
the answer is yes.

00:35:41.495 --> 00:35:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So taking us a
step further, that

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.790 align:middle line:84%
means that all the secrets
of the human body, the energy

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
secrets of the human body must
be found in a statue even.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The shape.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.367 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Because we
speak about the part of shape,

00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:84%
not the part of my
emotions, mental.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:84%
If you look at me, then I
might be accessing it mentally,

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, no, but--

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.126 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's about the
shape of subtle energy,

00:36:08.126 --> 00:36:08.390 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: The shape--

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.970 align:middle line:84%
the relationship
with subtle energy--

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.553 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM:
There's actually a lot

00:36:12.553 --> 00:36:14.660 align:middle line:84%
of practices that deal
with balancing the body

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:90%
through shaping the body.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: If
you think of yoga.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yoga.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.075 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: If
you think of tai chi.

00:36:19.075 --> 00:36:20.640 align:middle line:84%
If you think of even the
mudras, your hand positions.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Positions, shapes.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Shaping
the body to change

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:25.428 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the body.

00:36:25.428 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So as you change the
shape of the container,

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.730 align:middle line:84%
it changes the way that
the container resonates

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:34.778 align:middle line:84%
or communicates with all of
these multidimensional levels

00:36:34.778 --> 00:36:36.070 align:middle line:90%
that we've been speaking about.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:36.755 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The entire cosmos.

00:36:36.755 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Exactly.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yes,
so we have something.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, instead of
looking at the mudras,

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.390 align:middle line:84%
like that, that they
balance body energy,

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:84%
in BioGeometry I can actually
manipulate, get a wooden hand,

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:90%
and give it that shape.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.140 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a right
hand because of the--

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.540 align:middle line:90%
and do this shape.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is emitting the second
possible energy very powerfully

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.570 align:middle line:90%
from the finger.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:05.620 align:middle line:90%
So I can take it and do this.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it's emitting it
inside my body not horizontally.

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:90%
It has to be like that.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to
all the ancient art,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.300 align:middle line:84%
you will find that
they use this.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And we think they are
using it symbolic of God.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:84%
But we have to understand
ancient civilizations' symbol

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.670 align:middle line:90%
and practical science were one.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Same same.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:28.915 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:28.915 --> 00:37:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So
that is one shape.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:90%
So it's the body.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It's again--

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It was referencing
God, but a different kind of--

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: And even if
you bring it and put it--

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --definition of God.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.475 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: --how
he was doing like this,

00:37:36.475 --> 00:37:38.230 align:middle line:84%
there's is also a
lot of practices

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that talk about
bringing the tongue

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:90%
to the roof of the mouth.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So when you actually
do this, and it

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.770 align:middle line:84%
hits the roof of
the mouth, it will

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.450 align:middle line:90%
help bounce the entire body.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So I can get a
wooden hand, shape it that way,

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and use it for healing
or the body now.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: You
can use your hand too.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: You
see, the body here

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:02.890 align:middle line:84%
has through its
configuration, it has centers.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Any geometrical configuration
must have centers.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And by definition, a center
is a vortex, is a wormhole.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So we said, how is my
container connected

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.760 align:middle line:90%
to all the higher levels?

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:84%
It is connected through
many, many levels

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of wormholes that are centers,
resulting from the shape.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.002 align:middle line:84%
If the shape is perfect, it
creates so many wormholes

00:38:33.002 --> 00:38:34.960 align:middle line:84%
that connect to so many
different levels and so

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:90%
many different functions.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
levels that we know

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.490 align:middle line:84%
that wormholes--
for example, chakras

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.970 align:middle line:84%
are such wormholes, acupuncture
points and such, wormholes.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.950 align:middle line:84%
In the joints we
have such wormholes.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's stick the
chakras, for example.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It's then you say,
can the chakras

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.920 align:middle line:84%
have their origin
in just the shape?

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Can they exist in
a wooden statue?

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you take
a wooden statue like that,

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.700 align:middle line:84%
if you put both hands up like
that to get the full shape,

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:84%
you get emission from all
the chakras of the body.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, if I put the hands--

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
now, a simple way
is putting the palms

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.500 align:middle line:90%
on the level of every chakra.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So if I put the arms like
that on the level of the heart

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
chakra here, it's not very
flexible, this friend of mine.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It needs more yoga.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yeah.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.840 align:middle line:90%
It needs more yoga.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.650 align:middle line:84%
If I do that, then the
heart chakra emits.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.423 align:middle line:84%
If I do it a bit higher, like
this, the brow chakra emits.

00:39:41.423 --> 00:39:43.465 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: You can
do this to your own body.

00:39:43.465 --> 00:39:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: And I can
actually bring it down,

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.270 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So by moving actually the
hands of a statue this level,

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.160 align:middle line:84%
the hands on the level of a
chakra will cause it to emit.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But you can do that also
on your physical body.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:05.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'm a
lazy Egyptian person

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't want to
go through meditation,

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
go through things to
activate his chakras.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So all I do is I just I want
to activate my heart chakra

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.150 align:middle line:84%
or after lunch, my
digestive chakra here.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So all I have to do is just
put my palms on the level,

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:22.300 align:middle line:90%
at the same level.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.800 align:middle line:90%
It will activate.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But I don't even do that
because moving my arms

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.280 align:middle line:90%
is too strenuous for me.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I have a much easier thing.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I take a cup, any cup.

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just put it on the chakra,
like that, for a few seconds.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Put them on the chakras because
chakras are energy vortices.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.150 align:middle line:90%
They're like fire.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.600 align:middle line:84%
If you put your pot on fire,
you will shape the fire

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:90%
around the pot.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So I get a very simple
shape of a cup or anything

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and just hold it in my hand
and put it on any chakra.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.525 align:middle line:84%
It'll open it straight
away because the it will

00:40:56.525 --> 00:40:58.900 align:middle line:84%
shape the chakra because it's
speaking language of shape.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it creates
an opening, and--

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: It creates
and then the chakra is active.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --the fire comes around.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.693 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
What happens when you

00:41:03.693 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:90%
activate chakras of a statue?

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Through resonance, it would have
the same effect on the person

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.010 align:middle line:90%
sitting in the room.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can have
healing of a statue.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine the statue
with the proper proportions,

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:28.510 align:middle line:84%
having all the chakras active,
placed on a sacred power spot,

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.080 align:middle line:84%
like they had in Egypt,
all those megalith statues.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.472 align:middle line:84%
You could actually harmonize a
whole community on all levels

00:41:36.472 --> 00:41:37.930 align:middle line:84%
through the presence
of the statue.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:38.050 align:middle line:90%


00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: And the temple
in Luxor is actually designed

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:90%
so if you--

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.350 align:middle line:84%
the book by Schwaller de
Lubicz, he spent years

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:90%
studying the temple at Luxor.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
shows how, he talks

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.180 align:middle line:84%
about the human
archetypal figure,

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:84%
so if we say archetypal like
the blueprint upon which

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:53.950 align:middle line:90%
we're based.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
how as you move--

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the temple design is based on
that same archetypal figure

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that you find in all of the
ancient Egyptian statues.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And as you move through the
temple, as you walk through it,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:12.913 align:middle line:84%
it will activate or balance
different parts of the body.

00:42:12.913 --> 00:42:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, I can feel
it when I walk through.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Yeah.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's shaping the
consciousness as well.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Because each chakra
has a level of consciousness

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:21.730 align:middle line:90%
that goes with it.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:24.850 align:middle line:84%
This awareness is being
shaped and refined.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you're sharing
that this shape,

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.680 align:middle line:84%
that when we focus
upon the shape,

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that everyone that is
focusing upon the shape

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.400 align:middle line:90%
has the same harmonic happen.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:90%
They harmonize.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yes,
resonance happens.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:41.175 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the statues
of ancient Egypt,

00:42:41.175 --> 00:42:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the murtis of ancient India,
the deities that are in these

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:50.080 align:middle line:84%
proportions, even
Michelangelo's "David,"

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that is in particular proportion
that we all look to these

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.800 align:middle line:84%
things or that ancient
civilizations would look

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to the same statue would
harmonize the civilization

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:90%
into the same--

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.927 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
And the placement

00:43:02.927 --> 00:43:04.375 align:middle line:84%
is important on
sacred power spots

00:43:04.375 --> 00:43:05.425 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm-hmm.

00:43:05.425 --> 00:43:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So--

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Magnifying.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yeah.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: I mean, I think
a good thing to just sort of--

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:84%
to kind of bring
it all together,

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.087 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about sacred power

00:43:12.087 --> 00:43:14.350 align:middle line:84%
spots for a second, and
we're talking about the body,

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.150 align:middle line:90%
and we say the word centers.

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So just to clarify,
so in BioGeometry--

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:90%
and I'll show this briefly.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about the sacred
power spot energy or the grid

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.420 align:middle line:84%
lines, and you asked
how do we find it,

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:31.990 align:middle line:84%
so we actually have-- so we
can-- there's different types.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:84%
You can use different
biofeedback devices

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and see the effects on the body.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But very simply, we
actually have these tools

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:45.160 align:middle line:84%
called dials, where
we've correlated angles

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.260 align:middle line:90%
to different color qualities.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And so as you change the
angle, you can go into a space.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you change
the angle, you are

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.220 align:middle line:84%
changing the color that your
body is in resonance with

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.360 align:middle line:90%
and measuring.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
a sacred power spot,

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:84%
there's actually three color
combinations that you find.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:10.010 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the code or the
cornerstone of BioGeometry.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, because of
this effect, we call

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:84%
those-- because of the
effect, where, like we said,

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.980 align:middle line:84%
it's not polarized, it will
harmonize the whole energy

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:18.970 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:21.190 align:middle line:90%
We call it a centering quality.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But as an architect,
as soon as he

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:84%
discovered this in
a location, or not

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:28.330 align:middle line:84%
discovered in a
location, found the code

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:32.860 align:middle line:84%
as to how to detect this
energy quality, of course

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.370 align:middle line:84%
his next question was, well,
where do I find it in shapes?

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a coincidence that
we called it a centering energy

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:39.730 align:middle line:90%
quality.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
at a circle, you

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.570 align:middle line:84%
will actually find that
energy quality always

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.600 align:middle line:84%
exists in the
center of a circle,

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:84%
in the center of energy,
of any shape actually.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So when he was mentioning these
centers of the human body,

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:59.255 align:middle line:84%
it was where we detect that same
energy of a sacred power spot.

00:44:59.255 --> 00:45:00.880 align:middle line:84%
You detect the energy
of a sacred power

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.670 align:middle line:90%
spot in the shape of the body.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And the location of that
in the shape of the body

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.740 align:middle line:84%
happens to correlate with
what we call chakras.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So your chakras are doing
the same thing for you

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:84%
that the sacred power spots
are doing for our environment.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Holographic.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Yeah.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
Now, I'd like to say

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:22.750 align:middle line:90%
one thing about the centers.

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:25.570 align:middle line:84%
After all, we spoke
so much about centers.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:26.530 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Centers do not exist.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.303 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Why
they don't exist?

00:45:30.303 --> 00:45:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take a center,
and you enlarge it a bit,

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.255 align:middle line:90%
it has a center.

00:45:34.255 --> 00:45:35.130 align:middle line:90%
You enlarge it a bit.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.550 align:middle line:90%
It has a center.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.310 align:middle line:90%
So centers cannot exist.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Even the wormhole,
the center of wormhole

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:48.580 align:middle line:84%
is like a small circle
pointing to a center.

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But the center is not in the
manifested wormhole anyhow.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So that we understand,
that centers,

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.390 align:middle line:84%
any centers of any
geometrical shape,

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:06.940 align:middle line:84%
is actually a wormhole, a
vortex that automatically

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:90%
leads to higher dimension.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
deeper into that.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But every shape in
the physical dimension

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:84%
is connected to a pattern on a
higher dimension that actually

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.090 align:middle line:84%
governs the growth of
shapes in our physical world

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:29.300 align:middle line:90%
through those wormholes.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And holographic
representation continuing to

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.580 align:middle line:84%
compress itself here to
the physical dimensions.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:35.455 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yes.

00:46:35.455 --> 00:46:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you use the proper
design of BioGeometry,

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:43.670 align:middle line:84%
like nature, if you can imitate
nature, what you are doing,

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:48.230 align:middle line:84%
you're reconnecting
your physical design

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:51.230 align:middle line:84%
with the higher
dimensions of patterns

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that you call archetypal,
the higher archetype.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.490 align:middle line:90%
You're connecting to them.

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And once you're
connecting to them,

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that means your physical
level is connected

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to a higher spiritual
level, which

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.590 align:middle line:84%
will harmonize it all the time,
which will have harmony there.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And connecting to
this level, that's

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.680 align:middle line:84%
how ancient
civilizations persisted

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.480 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of
years because they

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.610 align:middle line:90%
were living on both levels.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm-hmm.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:18.710 align:middle line:90%
It was a spectrum.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yeah.

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Not two separate worlds.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: But you
have to be actively living

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:22.790 align:middle line:90%
on both levels.

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's why today
I feel very sad when

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I see lots of projects,
for example, where you move

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.330 align:middle line:84%
a temple from one
place to the other,

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:37.880 align:middle line:84%
or you move an obelisk
from one place to the other

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.760 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
you're de-rooting it

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:90%
from its life energy.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a vortex and now
it's out there with nothing

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.150 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And people don't understand when
you do that, you are actually

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.760 align:middle line:84%
disturbing all
other vortices, that

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.390 align:middle line:84%
means all other chakras of
humans, plants, and animals

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:08.240 align:middle line:84%
in the area when you move
a simple obelisk from one

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.218 align:middle line:84%
place to another or some temple
from one place to another.

00:48:11.218 --> 00:48:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The conspirator I would
say, maybe they do understand.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're moving for
power purposes, et cetera.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know is that
we start to tug on the weave,

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and everything gets
compromised because we're not

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.870 align:middle line:84%
allowing that original harmony
to be in its true existence.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is humanity's
challenge, right,

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:33.050 align:middle line:84%
is how do we progress without
becoming so obsessed with power

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:36.290 align:middle line:84%
that we take ourselves out
of the game altogether.

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you're doing
amazing work with this.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to us about
environmental problems

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.740 align:middle line:84%
that you've addressed
specifically with BioGeometry?

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Well, we
have a big problem today.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:55.670 align:middle line:84%
In general, environmental
thinking is very simple.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:57.830 align:middle line:90%
You reduce the pollutants.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.000 align:middle line:90%
So you have a pollutant.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.210 align:middle line:90%
You reduce it.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.002 align:middle line:90%
And the problem is solved.

00:49:02.002 --> 00:49:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: To do the trick.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:02.992 align:middle line:90%


00:49:02.992 --> 00:49:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
Yeah, it's solved.

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if you
have a pollutant

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that you are increasing
100 times daily,

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and you either are not
aware that there's harm.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.180 align:middle line:84%
You do not want to reduce
it, or you are not aware

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.658 align:middle line:90%
that it should be reduced.

00:49:28.658 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go into
conspiracy and say,

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.190 align:middle line:84%
you do not want to
reduce it because

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:34.230 align:middle line:90%
of interests or whatever.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.623 align:middle line:90%
But the fact is--

00:49:35.623 --> 00:49:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Either way
it's ignorance, right?

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.082 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Either
way it's ignorance.

00:49:39.082 --> 00:49:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, this new pollutant,
we are actually

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.420 align:middle line:90%
amplifying it every day.

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So it goes against all the
old way of looking at it.

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:54.120 align:middle line:84%
We cannot deal with our existing
paradigm of reducing pollutants

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:84%
because now we're at the time
of amplifying pollutants,

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.500 align:middle line:90%
of this pollutant.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's
electromagnetic radiation

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.200 align:middle line:84%
because the age of information
is built around it.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a huge problem.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.910 align:middle line:90%
What will happen?

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:14.010 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we
close our eyes when

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:18.030 align:middle line:84%
it comes to global
warming about anything

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:21.840 align:middle line:84%
that moves, any wave that moves,
like electromagnetic radiation

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.090 align:middle line:90%
would cause heat.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So filling the atmosphere
with electromagnetic radiation

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.150 align:middle line:84%
will contribute
to global warming,

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:31.570 align:middle line:90%
whether you like it or not.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But we say fossil
fuels, things like that,

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.240 align:middle line:90%
maybe for political reasons.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And we close our ears when
it comes to global warming

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.070 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic radiation.

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another aspect
of electromagnetic radiation

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.810 align:middle line:90%
that's very, very dangerous.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And I see that when studying
the ancient pyramids.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.610 align:middle line:90%
It gives us a lesson there.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:57.120 align:middle line:84%
There's an energy
quality in the pyramids

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.740 align:middle line:90%
that dehydrates things.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why things
don't rot in there.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's good
for mummification.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the same energy
quality exists

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.280 align:middle line:90%
in electromagnetic radiation.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So I have found that
electromagnetic radiation

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.670 align:middle line:90%
dehydrates life systems.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Dehydrates means what?

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:17.980 align:middle line:90%
It means the life force.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So electromagnetic radiation
is reducing the life force

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:23.160 align:middle line:90%
out of life systems

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, when this is
the case, there'll

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.920 align:middle line:84%
come a day when it will
increase to such a high level

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that all immune
systems will collapse.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So we have a hidden time bomb
in the age of information

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that might end our
civilization because

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.420 align:middle line:90%
of our ignorance or our greed.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is no way of trying
to go against civilization,

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.400 align:middle line:90%
against modern technology.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.400 align:middle line:84%
But what we are
seeing, remember,

00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:00.660 align:middle line:84%
instead of going
against the Earth,

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:05.160 align:middle line:84%
why don't we go with the Earth
and use the beneficent Earth

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.670 align:middle line:84%
energies, like Earth energy
passports and all that?

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we bring the
sacred energy quality

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:15.450 align:middle line:84%
into electromagnetic
radiation so we can produce,

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.930 align:middle line:84%
actually we can make the
whole atmosphere a big healing

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:23.460 align:middle line:84%
cocoon instead of a
big killing cocoon?

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.230 align:middle line:84%
We should be able
to have the wisdom

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:31.830 align:middle line:84%
to do that because
we do not know

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:90%
that we are the environment.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.690 align:middle line:84%
We are not living
in the environment.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:39.360 align:middle line:90%
No, we are the environment.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So by destroying the environment
with all this electricity

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.550 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, we're destroying
ourselves without knowing it.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm.

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:51.060 align:middle line:90%


00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: To tell
you, it's not just--

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.602 align:middle line:84%
I'm not being poetic by
saying you are the environment

00:52:55.602 --> 00:52:56.560 align:middle line:90%
or I'm the environment.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:02.370 align:middle line:84%
When I wake up in the morning,
I cannot open my mouth and feed

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:04.470 align:middle line:90%
off the sun's energy.

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I won't have to go to the
restaurant and have to eat it.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.600 align:middle line:84%
It would be very, very
economic to do that.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But I can't do that because
unfortunately I don't

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:16.020 align:middle line:90%
have an organ that can do that.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.720 align:middle line:84%
If I had an organ that would
capture the sun's energy,

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:23.430 align:middle line:84%
transform it into my living
energy, I could do that.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.980 align:middle line:90%
But I'm missing an organ.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.060 align:middle line:90%
But to be alive.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I have to find my organ.

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.570 align:middle line:90%
My organ is outside my body.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:33.360 align:middle line:90%
It's in the plants.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So the plants takes that energy,
transform to chemical energy,

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:39.160 align:middle line:84%
gives it back to me,
and I can take it.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So the plant is an
external human organ.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's extension, yes.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: It's
an extension to me.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's an
extension of the system.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.105 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: So there is no
way, whether we like it or not,

00:53:48.105 --> 00:53:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to separate myself
from the environment

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.950 align:middle line:84%
because one of my
organs is out there.

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So killing that organ
of yours out there

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.740 align:middle line:84%
is no different from
going and killing one

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.630 align:middle line:90%
of the organs inside your body.

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:02.830 align:middle line:84%
We have to reach
this understanding.

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we are not separate.

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And the environment
is a reflection

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:11.113 align:middle line:84%
of humanity's consciousness,
what we're allowing.

00:54:11.113 --> 00:54:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: And even just
diagnosing the subtle energy

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:17.350 align:middle line:84%
of the body, if you're facing
west, or you're facing east,

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and we look at your
subtle energy system,

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.360 align:middle line:90%
there will be differences.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's because your body's
reacting to the environment.

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:30.050 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Indian,
[INAUDIBLE] architecture

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:34.620 align:middle line:84%
is of this same understanding
and a beautiful demonstration.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: We have
many PhD research theses.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we
saw that we can actually

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:48.400 align:middle line:84%
have BioGeometrical shapes
restore the chemical level

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.200 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So people who have depression,
the serotonin was measured.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:57.120 align:middle line:90%
It goes down very much.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, using BioGeometry,
we raise the serotonin

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.390 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level than the
best drug on the market.

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And things like that--

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.320 align:middle line:90%


00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: That was the--

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yeah,
using geometrical shapes,

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:15.150 align:middle line:84%
we managed to change
the whole awareness.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: That's going
back to where we started.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.793 align:middle line:10%
That's the thesis
I was referring

00:55:18.793 --> 00:55:21.210 align:middle line:10%
to when I said that the medical
department called and said

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.600 align:middle line:10%
stop sending us your students.

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.142 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
Yes, stop sending us

00:55:24.142 --> 00:55:27.460 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to know
that, what's happening.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine seeing a child
with some brain problem going

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:39.090 align:middle line:84%
into a geometrical
shape or a classroom.

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, his
awareness changes and becomes

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.590 align:middle line:84%
like ours, a normal
awareness, at least

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:50.350 align:middle line:84%
for a very short period
during he's in the shape.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:52.300 align:middle line:90%
The mothers were crying.

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:56.070 align:middle line:84%
We were emotionally so
touched, especially when

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:59.460 align:middle line:84%
the child had convulsions
before he came in or hyper,

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.560 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.500 align:middle line:84%
They completely
changed in that shape.

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fascinating.

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:08.610 align:middle line:84%
This has been amazing,
fascinating information.

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:10.590 align:middle line:90%
And please don't stop.

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Please continue your research
and keep bringing us models

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and send us your students, if
the medical profession doesn't

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:18.630 align:middle line:90%
want to hear them.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.672 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: The good
thing about BioGeometry

00:56:20.672 --> 00:56:24.100 align:middle line:84%
is I have my children
working with me.

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So I have my eldest son,
Sayid, you saw working with me.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:34.290 align:middle line:84%
In his work, he is teaching
people all around the world,

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:39.030 align:middle line:84%
certifying them to go and
sort of work on harmonizing

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.470 align:middle line:90%
and protecting homes.

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Then I have my other
daughter, Lila,

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:46.560 align:middle line:84%
who is actually
supervising the design

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.570 align:middle line:90%
fields of all design in Egypt.

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And then Doreya is
actually working with me

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.590 align:middle line:84%
in developing new
research and all that.

00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So I feel I'm
leaving BioGeometry

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.900 align:middle line:90%
into trustworthy hands.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.038 align:middle line:90%
And my wife now manages--

00:57:03.038 --> 00:57:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: It helps.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:04.997 align:middle line:90%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM: Yeah.

00:57:04.997 --> 00:57:07.890 align:middle line:84%
My wife manages the
whole thing with.

00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Them so leaving everything
to your family--

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.670 align:middle line:84%
we have instructors
all around the world.

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:16.783 align:middle line:90%
But the family is the hub.

00:57:16.783 --> 00:57:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: And he's
not leaving anything.

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're not
leaving any time soon.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Yeah, exactly.

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.500 align:middle line:90%
So there's no leaving--

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're coming
back on the show.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: There's
no leaving happening.

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Tell me where can
people find more information

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:28.270 align:middle line:90%
about BioGeometry?

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:29.820 align:middle line:90%
How can they find you?

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.500 align:middle line:10%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Well,
he has two books,

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.170 align:middle line:10%
"Back to a Future For Mankind"
and "BioGeometry Signatures."

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:35.448 align:middle line:90%
They're both on Amazon.

00:57:35.448 --> 00:57:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Those are a wonderful
place to start.

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:38.370 align:middle line:10%
If you're interested
more in what

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:40.510 align:middle line:10%
we talked about, the
subtle energy spots,

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:43.470 align:middle line:10%
how do we find them, the
electromagnetic radiation,

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:45.570 align:middle line:10%
I recommend "Back
to the Future."

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:50.460 align:middle line:10%
And if you're interested more
in actually just going straight

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.070 align:middle line:10%
to shapes that help the body,
I recommend "BioGeometry

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:55.325 align:middle line:10%
Signatures" and just
check out the website,

00:57:55.325 --> 00:57:56.533 align:middle line:10%
biogeometry.com or dot ca.

00:57:56.533 --> 00:57:57.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: biogeomtry.com.

00:57:57.450 --> 00:57:58.490 align:middle line:10%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Yeah.

00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:57:58.890 --> 00:57:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:03.030 align:middle line:84%
You've brought so much
stimulating conversation,

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:07.320 align:middle line:84%
bridging the ancient and the now
and the necessary for healing,

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.782 align:middle line:84%
for wholeness, for health,
vitality, and a sense of self

00:58:10.782 --> 00:58:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and fulfillment in this
life, which is what we're all

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:14.530 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be living.

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And so thank you for the
work you've been doing.

00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREYA KARIM: Thank
you for having us.

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>IBRAHIM KARIM:
Thank you, Dr. Sue,

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.860 align:middle line:84%
because we feel with you we
are in the same boat somehow.

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.952 align:middle line:90%
It's very resonant, yes.

00:58:23.952 --> 00:58:27.270 align:middle line:84%
BioGeometry may become one of
the most important sciences

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.880 align:middle line:84%
for the future of
wellness on this planet.

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karim and
Doreya are pioneers

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.280 align:middle line:84%
in addressing the deep
connection between our bodies

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.342 align:middle line:90%
and the environment.

00:58:36.342 --> 00:58:37.800 align:middle line:84%
