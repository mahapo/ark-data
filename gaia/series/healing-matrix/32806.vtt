>> Regina Meredith:
What would you do

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.871 align:middle line:84%
if there were a technology where
you could climb into a bed,

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.807 align:middle line:84%
be bathed in light, sound
and frequencies drift off

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.176 align:middle line:90%
to sleep and awaken renewed.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.212 align:middle line:84%
The most exciting part of
the times we live in is

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:48.081 align:middle line:84%
that the genius of creation is
offering us options we never

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.118 align:middle line:84%
dream possible just
one or 2 decades ago.

Barry McNew is the
creator of the Life Vessel.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.757 align:middle line:84%
Scientists, doctors and
clients alike are heralding it

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.092 align:middle line:90%
as the real deal.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.795 align:middle line:84%
A device that allows the
bodies own intelligence

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.965 align:middle line:84%
to realign itself to a
healthy pattern physically

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.466 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.035 align:middle line:84%
And first off Barry I want to
thank you so much for being here

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.238 align:middle line:84%
because I know that you've
been hiding from the media

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.141 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time,
you've had many,

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.344 align:middle line:84%
many offers to go mainstream and
otherwise with this technology

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:21.882 align:middle line:84%
but for very good reason you
have kept everything very calm

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:26.619 align:middle line:84%
around this until all the test
could be brought in to bear.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.124 align:middle line:84%
And in favor of your
technology no less.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:34.961 align:middle line:84%
And so, I want to welcome you
back to the world of media.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Barry McNew: Thank
you very much.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.365 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor to be here
with you this afternoon.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:40.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Barry,
first of all I just want

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.202 align:middle line:84%
to say something that
I think most of people

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
that I've interviewed on this
show have this particular genius

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that they have accessed
within themselves

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.044 align:middle line:90%
that not everybody finds.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:55.115 align:middle line:84%
You by the age of 4 had
already found this genius

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.284 align:middle line:84%
in yourself speaking
to you and if you want

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.653 align:middle line:84%
to get just a quick idea of what
happened because I think it kind

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:01.721 align:middle line:90%
of sets up your life really.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Barry McNew: I was
4 years old and living

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:09.763 align:middle line:84%
in Kansas the time on a farm,
was traveling from town back

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:12.999 align:middle line:84%
to the farm with my
father and my sister was 3

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:17.537 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I was brought
in awareness of an accident

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.172 align:middle line:90%
that was about to happen.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.809 align:middle line:84%
It ended up being of us and
I got down on the floorboard

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.213 align:middle line:84%
of the old 49 Chevrolet pickup
trying to push on the right

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.882 align:middle line:84%
to stop with my dad
saying, "What are you doing?

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Get away. Get away."

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.087 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing we hit
and when I awoken I awoke

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to my sister bleeding
to death and my dad

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.128 align:middle line:84%
and the other driver buried
in wheat side by side.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:46.566 align:middle line:84%
I ended up uncovering them
to find death of one of them

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:50.503 align:middle line:84%
and my sister in dire
need of help and left her

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:54.574 align:middle line:84%
to go find help and at 4 years
old you don't really know that's

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.976 align:middle line:90%
what you're suppose to do

00:02:55.976 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and for some reason the gift was
there and was able to do that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.417 align:middle line:84%
and ended up being at the
home of the family of the man

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.819 align:middle line:90%
that was laying down beside.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When you were four years
old wondering down the street

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.491 align:middle line:84%
to find help you stumbled
into the house where the wife

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.827 align:middle line:84%
of the other man who had
died in the accident.

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:14.828 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Well, it was a family.

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:15.562 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The family.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.896 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yes, yes.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:17.697 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Where the other man--
the other man who had died.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:18.999 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Exactly.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.268 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And what's amazing
about this story if you look

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:23.336 align:middle line:84%
at the headlines, that
newspaper clipping.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.373 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is really
quite a major accident.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.141 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah, its true it was.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.844 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Every one should have
died in that including you

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.245 align:middle line:90%
but you were unscathed.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Never had a scratch.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.148 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.418 align:middle line:84%
So, I bring that up
because you were preserved

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.853 align:middle line:90%
for purpose obviously.

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:44.157 align:middle line:84%
In my mind there was a reason
you had to live through that.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:47.027 align:middle line:84%
And in certainly and understand
something about the world

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.795 align:middle line:90%
in yourself in a different way.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:52.165 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Right, and I think
that brought me to a level of,

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:56.469 align:middle line:84%
you know, at four you
try to understand trauma.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.906 align:middle line:84%
And death-- death is
not very easy at four.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:03.243 align:middle line:84%
And back then they had
nothing for anybody.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.413 align:middle line:84%
I can remember crying
in the afternoons

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.882 align:middle line:84%
and my mom saying,
"Go to your room.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:09.649 align:middle line:90%
Take a nap.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:10.884 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel better later."

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:12.118 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's how you
handled your father's death?

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:13.687 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: That's how you
handle it back then.

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So, there's always been in
the back of mind the need

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.492 align:middle line:84%
for something for
humanity to be able

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:24.497 align:middle line:84%
to well themselves whether
it be from emotional trauma,

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.933 align:middle line:84%
physical trauma or
environmental.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:31.671 align:middle line:84%
And as life moved forward the
life also came into creation.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about
that because of course

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.409 align:middle line:84%
that question is usually
number one and it has to be

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.178 align:middle line:84%
because people are
going to want to know

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:39.612 align:middle line:90%
where did this come from.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.781 align:middle line:84%
And like Einstein
and many other people

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.617 align:middle line:84%
who have their genius
working and concert

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.821 align:middle line:84%
with their conscious mind that's
how it worked for you too.

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.189 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: That's exactly.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.523 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: In a very special way
and if you can talk about it.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.059 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: That's exactly how it
came through and, you know,

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.461 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people want
to say, well,

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.729 align:middle line:90%
you're not educated for that.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:56.596 align:middle line:90%
You're not a scientist.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.098 align:middle line:90%
You're not the doctor.

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:01.234 align:middle line:84%
Well, had I been this probably
wouldn't have come to be

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:02.535 align:middle line:90%
because it didn't fit physics,

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.838 align:middle line:84%
it didn't fit medicine
at the time.

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:08.675 align:middle line:84%
And it had to be brought in a
way that openness could come

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.678 align:middle line:84%
with it and then
the teaching of it.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.613 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't always
something that we--

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:17.317 align:middle line:84%
we know that greatness
comes from.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.285 align:middle line:84%
The greatest things out
there came from people

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:22.555 align:middle line:84%
that weren't taught
in the schools.

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:24.991 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, of course, I
read many books on this

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.227 align:middle line:90%
and your talking about genuine--

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:31.231 align:middle line:84%
its generally an intuitive
insight either while someone is

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:34.934 align:middle line:84%
sleeping or just zoning out
riding on a bus somewhere,

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:37.037 align:middle line:84%
sitting out in nature
and boom its there,

00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:38.271 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing is there.

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.206 align:middle line:84%
And that includes the people
who are considered some

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:42.175 align:middle line:84%
of the great geniuses
of science.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.676 align:middle line:84%
It didn't come through
the protocols

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.677 align:middle line:84%
of what they had
already learned.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:47.847 align:middle line:84%
It came through flashes
of intuition.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.084 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: You're exactly right
and that's how this came to me.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:54.687 align:middle line:84%
This was a gift and
I went with it.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:57.791 align:middle line:90%
And today it is what it is.

00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:59.225 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it came
it dream time?

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.693 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Dream time, yeah.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:03.096 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it came over a few
nights in a row in great detail?

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Yeah, it was about 3 or
4 nights have it come through.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.703 align:middle line:84%
The first night was very
frightening to me because a lot

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.872 align:middle line:84%
of things I didn't
even understand

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.174 align:middle line:84%
that were wrapped
around science.

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:15.608 align:middle line:90%
And then it's about OK,

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:17.944 align:middle line:84%
now I have to understand
the human body.

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:21.181 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, even
though growing up on a farm

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.249 align:middle line:90%
and always thinking

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:25.852 align:middle line:84%
about veterinary medicine
my whole young life

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:90%
but never went into that.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.922 align:middle line:90%
I was around it.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:31.057 align:middle line:84%
So, I knew life and death and
I'd seen it at a very young age

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:36.362 align:middle line:84%
and so, you know, it opened
and I guess I was open to it.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:38.932 align:middle line:84%
So, I was able to
move forward with it

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:42.435 align:middle line:84%
and understand what
was being given to me.

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Even though you
didn't fully understand it.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.872 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: You know, I didn't
fully understand it.

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.507 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You couldn't
understand how to create it.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:48.308 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah, exactly right.

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:49.442 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: But you're talking--

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.311 align:middle line:84%
you're working in the
world of quantum physics

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.179 align:middle line:84%
and actually beyond
the quantum even.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.215 align:middle line:84%
You're working in
fields of intelligence.

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:56.583 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:01.754 align:middle line:84%
And the levels of
connection and consciousness.

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, you have to
be connected to your being

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.693 align:middle line:84%
in order understand
the consciousness.

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:07.827 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.597 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: So, this kind of
brought it all together

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:14.434 align:middle line:84%
to where the individual
can do it on himself.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.502 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:16.836 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now, let's talk
about what happened.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.172 align:middle line:84%
I mean you had to get
a tool box obviously,

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:20.406 align:middle line:90%
put it-- [laughs] get your--

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.741 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: I did.

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.243 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Dust your tools off
and start building this thing

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:25.211 align:middle line:84%
which looks like,
well, it just looks

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:90%
like a wooden box basically.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.381 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: It looks like it

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:31.384 align:middle line:84%
but simplicity is not
always what it looks like.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:33.319 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: From the outside it
looks like a wooden box.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.856 align:middle line:84%
But you had to start figuring
out how to engineer this thing

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:39.626 align:middle line:84%
and get light waves
and frequency

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.528 align:middle line:90%
and vibration all into this.

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:44.597 align:middle line:84%
And let me say I did one
session last week in prep

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:48.067 align:middle line:84%
for this 'cause I wanted to know
what we're talking about here.

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.036 align:middle line:90%
And the only way to describe it.

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.704 align:middle line:84%
I mean there-- I had
my own experiences,

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
everyone does inside the vehicle
but it was a slice of heaven.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.048 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing
experience being in there.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.617 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: When I was
creating it and building it

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:08.821 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning it was tedious
and long because it was a lot

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:11.958 align:middle line:84%
of trial and error to repeat
and tear it down and rebuild it.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.594 align:middle line:90%
Times were this isn't for me.

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:18.331 align:middle line:84%
But I kept going and continued
an actually had a working

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.167 align:middle line:84%
prototype before I ever
had the patents done.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.337 align:middle line:84%
So, it was one where I had
a prototype when I went

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.339 align:middle line:90%
to see the patent attorneys.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.875 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have a number
of patents on it now?

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.276 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: I have a number
of patents on it.

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.378 align:middle line:90%
US Patents, now and--

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:35.014 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it's also going to
be license in other countries?

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:35.949 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right, [inaudible].

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You have people
flying in.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.953 align:middle line:90%
I was talking to your cohort

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.387 align:middle line:84%
that runs the center
here near Boulder.

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.725 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: She said there are people
that fly in at all hours coming

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.361 align:middle line:84%
in from China to
have a few sessions.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.331 align:middle line:84%
And even late last night at 1:30
in the morning a doctor came in

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to have a session
and then so establish himself

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.538 align:middle line:84%
for his own facility and we're
looking at a little bit of this.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.173 align:middle line:90%
What's happening on the inside?

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:02.742 align:middle line:84%
When you lie in at the first
thing you notice as you're

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:06.679 align:middle line:84%
in there is this area that's
been cut out that has lights

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.315 align:middle line:90%
of varying different geometry.

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:12.051 align:middle line:84%
Geometrical shapes
but also colors

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:14.887 align:middle line:84%
so maybe just tell
us what's at play?

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, we're looking
at defractured light

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.793 align:middle line:84%
and reflectory [phonetic]
and we're using the lights

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:23.896 align:middle line:84%
of the colors of
the visible light.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:28.301 align:middle line:84%
So, that when we change
the intensity of the light

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.003 align:middle line:90%
and in the defractured use

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:35.842 align:middle line:84%
of the refectories we can
actually bring hues of color

00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:39.112 align:middle line:84%
that the eye really
wouldn't pick up normally.

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:42.915 align:middle line:84%
So, these are that which
are absorbed optically

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:45.318 align:middle line:84%
to the brain as well
to the skin.

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:48.655 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're bringing
that frequency in

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:51.024 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time we're
bringing sound frequency.

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And the key to the whole
process is we're doing

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.396 align:middle line:90%
in a resonant frequency.

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:57.597 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Explain what
that means [inaudible]--

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:02.268 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, resonance is
a-- is a toning over a--

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:06.506 align:middle line:84%
energetic frequency of
something that's known, OK?

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:11.544 align:middle line:84%
And what did with this
unit was able to create

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:16.082 align:middle line:84%
that around the frequency and
was given to me was C flat minor

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:21.287 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't really exists
in our culture of music.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:22.622 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So, classically taught.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.557 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Yeah, but when they
did a lot of the studies on it

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and they did everything about
the wood and the airspace

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.129 align:middle line:84%
and the measurements and what
have you they came to find

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
that by putting all that
together there were three chords

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.437 align:middle line:84%
that ended up being what
would be called C flat minor.

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:38.971 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There's another
rope to this too.

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:39.872 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:41.074 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: King Tut's Tomb.

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.709 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And they claimed
that was the same tunnels

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:44.844 align:middle line:84%
that they were finding
in the tomb of King Tut.

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:47.313 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Isn't that
interesting or coincidental.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.548 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Coincidental maybe.

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:50.483 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about why
that's not coincidental.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.784 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, I don't
think its coincidental

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:54.554 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's
probably the eternal tone maybe

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:59.192 align:middle line:84%
that the body can-- you have to
go there where the body can go

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:01.828 align:middle line:84%
to that relaxed state
and what was unique

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:07.467 align:middle line:84%
in this was what I found was the
place where the body releases,

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:12.004 align:middle line:84%
let go and recess is that
a level below the level

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.272 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness whether it be

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:14.874 align:middle line:84%
at their awake state
or asleep state.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:19.112 align:middle line:84%
It was unique to the doctors to
see that I could take the body

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:21.447 align:middle line:84%
and the brain waves to
a two hertz frequency

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.616 align:middle line:90%
and still be wide awake.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.752 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because not everybody
that goes in this falls asleep.

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:27.453 align:middle line:84%
It's just so beautiful
and relaxing.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:28.588 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:29.856 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You tend-- you
could tend to drift off

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.792 align:middle line:84%
and certainly just be in
dreamy kinds of thoughts.

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:36.329 align:middle line:84%
So, that is not considered
to be possible.

00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:37.663 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:40.833 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: To be in a 2 hertz
range which is low, low delta.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.268 align:middle line:90%
That's deep, deep sleep.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:43.403 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:44.804 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, is it fair
to say that when most

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:47.473 align:middle line:84%
of us are sleeping at night
we're actually never really

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:50.843 align:middle line:84%
going to do that depth
for the most part.

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:54.347 align:middle line:84%
Are we mostly staying up in
the 4 to 6 hertz range or--

00:11:54.347 --> 00:11:56.215 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Yeah, and
not being the doctor

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:59.752 align:middle line:84%
and not understanding
all of their world.

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:02.088 align:middle line:84%
But what I have been
told that's correct.

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:04.357 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, we go in and out.

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:05.458 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:06.793 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: The thing that's
unique about this is

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:09.695 align:middle line:84%
that you may think you're
awake or you may think you went

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:12.532 align:middle line:84%
to sleep but people go
in there and they'll be

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:16.002 align:middle line:84%
for the hour totally asleep we
can hear them snoring whatever

00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:18.204 align:middle line:84%
from the outside and they'll
awake and when you bring them

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:20.373 align:middle line:84%
out they say, "I don't
think I slept at all."

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:22.375 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: [Laughs] Its kind
of like being in hypnosis.

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:25.711 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: So, it's loosing
that consciousness

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:28.881 align:middle line:84%
of what is right now and just
being in the [inaudible].

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Loosing awareness at
the physical world really

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.989 align:middle line:84%
in your physical reality but
because we tend to repair.

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:39.225 align:middle line:84%
I mean we repair at night
when we're sleeping.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:40.359 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: The body repairs.

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:41.627 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's when the
body starts repairing.

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.263 align:middle line:90%
But what I'm hearing in this is

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:48.868 align:middle line:84%
that if you can take the
person's frequencies lower

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:51.471 align:middle line:84%
than they can go in
sleep time your--

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.506 align:middle line:84%
like you're saying your
taking to where ideally.

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:56.309 align:middle line:84%
In an ideal world we
would all be sleeping

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:58.578 align:middle line:90%
and resting at 2 hertz.

00:12:58.578 --> 00:12:59.645 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Correct.

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.147 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And deep, deep
delta but were not

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:02.782 align:middle line:90%
where our bodies are strung out.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.185 align:middle line:84%
The interference from so many
different things is there.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:11.924 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you can get the
cellular aspect of it to be

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:17.997 align:middle line:84%
at that level then internally
the body can reset, OK.

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:21.434 align:middle line:84%
So, I could sit here
and talk with you

00:13:21.434 --> 00:13:24.237 align:middle line:84%
but I could also take
myself to that place

00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:25.938 align:middle line:90%
and still reset little problem.

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:27.273 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And now that's something

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:31.611 align:middle line:84%
that has really only been
demonstrated by monks, Tibetan,

00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:35.047 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan monks that have
been practicing meditation

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.716 align:middle line:90%
for 30 and 40 years.

00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:39.552 align:middle line:84%
I mean there had been a
lot of brain mapping done

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:40.753 align:middle line:90%
on some of these monks.

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:45.858 align:middle line:84%
And even they can't remain
conscious at 2 hertz.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:49.729 align:middle line:84%
And yet your brain has
been mapped and you can be

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:90%
in that low hertz range.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.765 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Wide awake.

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:55.534 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Physically and mentally
and wide awake at 2 hertz.

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:58.204 align:middle line:84%
I mean the test have
done on you.

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:02.909 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, what does that
mean if you can manage to walk

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:05.578 align:middle line:84%
around while conscious
in that state does

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:09.115 align:middle line:84%
that mean your body is in some
kind of coherence all the time.

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:11.684 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: What I call is what I
named it was a synchronistic

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:14.687 align:middle line:84%
serial of coherency to where
I could get all the cells

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:20.226 align:middle line:84%
of the body to be performing
in rhythm and in harmony.

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:24.397 align:middle line:84%
So, I could come into a stress
situation based on stress

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:26.165 align:middle line:90%
to the autonomic nervous system.

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:29.168 align:middle line:84%
I can instantly take
myself to that calming

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:31.203 align:middle line:84%
and distress instantaneously
at the same time.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.872 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You didn't have to
go in the vessel anymore.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.308 align:middle line:84%
You've done it enough that's
it's programmed, didn't you?

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:37.376 align:middle line:84%
OK, you just brought up the
next thing I was going to talk

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:40.012 align:middle line:84%
about the autonomic
nervous system.

00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:43.516 align:middle line:84%
That is really at the source
of almost all chronic disease

00:14:43.516 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:90%
on one level or another.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.787 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be you're either
we're stuck in the honor.

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:48.721 align:middle line:90%
We're stuck in the oven.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.922 align:middle line:90%
And most of us are stuck in the

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:53.492 align:middle line:84%
on position pedal
with a rock on it.

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:55.995 align:middle line:84%
The accelerator with a
rock on it so let's talk

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:58.931 align:middle line:84%
about what this is doing
'cause it directly impacts the

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:00.566 align:middle line:90%
nervous system.

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:03.869 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, I believe we're in
what's called the age of speed.

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:07.139 align:middle line:84%
And we're a 100 mile an
hour all of us at some level

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:08.808 align:middle line:90%
and everything around us.

00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:11.043 align:middle line:84%
Very difficult for
us to stop, shut down

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:14.313 align:middle line:90%
and shut off, reset, rebalance.

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:18.317 align:middle line:84%
And with this, this
allows for that to happen.

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:22.955 align:middle line:84%
The problem we get into and it's
becoming known Medical Journals

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:25.891 align:middle line:84%
are writing about it,
articles everyday.

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:27.293 align:middle line:84%
Stress is probably
going to be a number--

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
one of the number one diseases
and disorders in our country.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.565 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And its certainly
is responsible

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:34.734 align:middle line:84%
for all the rest
of them very much.

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:35.868 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:39.205 align:middle line:84%
So, and we don't look
at it a lot of times as,

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.173 align:middle line:90%
well, I'm stressed out.

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.242 align:middle line:84%
But stress can come
from inflammation.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:46.479 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation I believe is a
start of disease and disorder.

00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:47.513 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:50.049 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And so, if
we can get that out

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:54.286 align:middle line:84%
and we can teach the body to
let out as much as it takes

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:84%
in then we can keep the
body in a harmonistic state.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:02.028 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, when the person is
going in there, this is based

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:04.864 align:middle line:84%
on the premise you have us a
wonderful sign on your wall

00:16:04.864 --> 00:16:06.298 align:middle line:84%
that says something
to the effect

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.768 align:middle line:84%
of the body knows
no disease by name.

00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:10.503 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: A body doesn't
know disease by name.

00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:11.303 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: By name.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.938 align:middle line:90%
Its just frequencies, right?

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:13.506 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It never has.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.574 align:middle line:90%
It never will.

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:19.812 align:middle line:84%
What the body does
understand is an imbalance.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:24.717 align:middle line:84%
So, when you start putting names
and categories and disorders

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and disease now you
put an intent

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.057 align:middle line:84%
and you have to put
a perception.

00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:35.594 align:middle line:84%
And there's been studies saying
that people end up with that,

00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:38.097 align:middle line:84%
that may have-- may or
may not have had it.

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:40.299 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The mind is a very
powerful force of creation.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.233 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Very powerful thing.

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:43.135 align:middle line:84%
That form creates
a lot of things.

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:45.204 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, you're going
on the premise then

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:47.139 align:middle line:84%
that the body already
knows how--

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:49.341 align:middle line:84%
this is a very intelligent
system

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:90%
that knows how to heal itself.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.513 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Exactly, because it works
on the imbalances in the body.

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And people will go in and they
will find old injuries and stuff

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.086 align:middle line:84%
and be painful and suddenly
they clear right on through.

00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:01.554 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, a lot
of people also go in

00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:04.989 align:middle line:84%
and have emotional experiences
before anything else something

00:17:04.989 --> 00:17:07.159 align:middle line:90%
way out of the past pops up.

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:10.296 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, if it's true
then about 85 to 87 percent

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:12.998 align:middle line:84%
of the sickness and
disease today based

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:84%
on what was being wrote
is from emotional trauma.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.306 align:middle line:84%
It's a big priority
in our lives.

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:25.044 align:middle line:84%
And right now the
emotional trauma is creating

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
that which is got
everybody in chaos.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.048 align:middle line:90%
And it is very difficult to come

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.016 align:middle line:84%
out of an emotional
trauma by yourself.

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.118 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:33.586 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: What is very
hard for someone else

00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:90%
to bring you out of a tube.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:40.326 align:middle line:84%
But it's not impossible if
you can do it within yourself.

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:42.394 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Those traumas do tend
to get trapped in there.

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:43.629 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: They do trap.

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, I wanted to
bring up something at this--

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.302 align:middle line:84%
and normally I would
bring that up later on.

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:52.071 align:middle line:84%
But you told me about
this off camera

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.507 align:middle line:84%
which I found very
interesting about the mind

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:55.841 align:middle line:90%
and the belief system.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:58.744 align:middle line:84%
So, basically you don't need
to buy into the technology.

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.279 align:middle line:90%
But you need to just show up.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.181 align:middle line:84%
Just show up and have
a somewhat clear mind

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:05.451 align:middle line:84%
and a genuine interest
in feeling good again

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and having your health
or your vitality back.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.755 align:middle line:84%
That's all you really need
is just a desire, right?

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.224 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: It's a desire
to be responsible

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.392 align:middle line:90%
for your own healthcare.

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and this
is a big deal.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.761 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Get your wellness.

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean we're on our own
where healthcare is concerned.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.832 align:middle line:84%
And we have Obama
care coming up.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.535 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we are going
to be even more on our own.

00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:27.339 align:middle line:84%
So, much as not in place for
us that us and the generations

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:29.475 align:middle line:90%
that are younger and coming up.

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:31.944 align:middle line:84%
We need to find technologies
and means

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.012 align:middle line:90%
of taking care of our self.

00:18:33.012 --> 00:18:33.879 align:middle line:90%
This is critical.

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:34.814 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:36.315 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Nonetheless
there are times

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:39.051 align:middle line:84%
when this may not
work so to speak.

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:40.953 align:middle line:84%
And you told me off
camera about this woman

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.354 align:middle line:90%
who had a brain tumor.

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:46.091 align:middle line:84%
And the strength of identity
with disease, this is a big one

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:47.226 align:middle line:90%
to bring up because I know a lot

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:50.029 align:middle line:84%
of people listening have
either been through this

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:51.397 align:middle line:84%
or know people who
been through it.

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:53.299 align:middle line:84%
Just tell us that little
story if you would please.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.001 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, it is where
that was her identity.

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:57.203 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: She had a brain tumor.

00:18:57.203 --> 00:19:00.372 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Had the brain tumor
and as it would get--

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:02.408 align:middle line:90%
we could see it dissipating.

00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:05.477 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what she
wanted, you know, there was

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.313 align:middle line:84%
and then there was times
where we will get him

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:11.584 align:middle line:84%
to where they can't even
believe that that can--

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:13.686 align:middle line:90%
the body can heal that itself.

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:14.253 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:15.554 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: OK.

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:19.925 align:middle line:84%
And so we-- we see all kinds
of things that on go here.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:22.127 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But this woman
was very direct with you.

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:24.063 align:middle line:90%
She was starting to improve.

00:19:24.063 --> 00:19:25.231 align:middle line:90%
It was turning the corner.

00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:25.898 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:26.465 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And she quit.

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: She quit.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.001 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And said who am I
without my brain tumor.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:33.072 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: She said I won't know who
I am and no one else will either

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:35.174 align:middle line:90%
and I cant do this anymore.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.042 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because her whole
identity was wrapped

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.877 align:middle line:84%
up in being a woman
with the brain tumor.

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:42.815 align:middle line:84%
So, there were some-- there
were some hidden benefits there

00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:46.685 align:middle line:84%
on some emotional or mental
or some kind of level.

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:47.953 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:50.356 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that's not uncommon
for people who are sick.

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:55.027 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: No, no, it happens
all the time and, you know,

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:58.364 align:middle line:84%
we're in a-- we're in a
stage where as we're either--

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:01.333 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people think
they're entitled.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.403 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think
they're deserving and

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:08.474 align:middle line:84%
yet they don't want to pay
the price to be responsible.

00:20:08.474 --> 00:20:09.575 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:13.379 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And so, with
Life Vessel it's a means

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:16.982 align:middle line:84%
by which you can be
responsible and you do take part

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:19.785 align:middle line:84%
in your wellness never to
take away from medicine

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's always
going to be there.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.756 align:middle line:84%
This is just another
tool in the tool box.

00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:26.759 align:middle line:84%
It has greatness
for the doctors.

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:29.762 align:middle line:84%
It has greatness for
the people and it works

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:33.065 align:middle line:90%
on such a fast timeline

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.834 align:middle line:84%
that it's just almost
unbelievable sometimes what's

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:37.036 align:middle line:90%
its capable of doing.

00:20:37.036 --> 00:20:38.637 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And we're going to
talk about some of that.

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.773 align:middle line:84%
And before we get to
some of the case studies

00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:43.375 align:middle line:84%
that are really kind of
shocking and it falls

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.943 align:middle line:84%
over into the miraculous
category.

00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:46.445 align:middle line:84%
But again you see
that all the time.

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:50.149 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about some of the
test that have been conducted

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:53.686 align:middle line:84%
and some of the devices that
have been built even by MIT,

00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:56.722 align:middle line:84%
Boeing has been involved
in some of these research.

00:20:56.722 --> 00:21:00.859 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of science
behind what you're doing now.

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:04.663 align:middle line:84%
And let-- lets, you know,
let's talk about some of it.

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:06.298 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
there is been--

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:07.433 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just throwing it all

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:10.069 align:middle line:84%
out there see what
sticks on the wall, right?

00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:13.572 align:middle line:84%
There's also been remote
viewing by very elite members

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:17.042 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA, SRI and CIA
Remote Viewing Team is

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:23.449 align:middle line:84%
that normally are tasked with
finding silos, nuclear silos

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.717 align:middle line:90%
in foreign lands and such.

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:26.618 align:middle line:84%
So, they have to be
good at what they do.

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:28.887 align:middle line:84%
I've met and interviewed
some of these people

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.356 align:middle line:90%
for the last 30 years.

00:21:30.356 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:90%
These guys can see.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And they've even remote
viewed this technology.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.894 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:37.329 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This is not something
that just airy ferry.

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:38.931 align:middle line:84%
You've just been
under the radar.

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:40.199 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:45.838 align:middle line:84%
And you use that under the
radar just I kept it slow

00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:47.539 align:middle line:90%
so it could be correct.

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:51.043 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted the right
people around it and I wanted

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:53.278 align:middle line:84%
to bring it out at
the right time.

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And I believe were there.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.515 align:middle line:90%
I think we have the need.

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:59.818 align:middle line:84%
I think society and
humanity is looking for this.

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:02.187 align:middle line:84%
And I think the communities
are looking

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:04.656 align:middle line:84%
for it whether it be
the medical community,

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.092 align:middle line:84%
the educational world,
science world.

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:10.195 align:middle line:84%
We are all needing
help right now.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:13.365 align:middle line:84%
And this has a means to
not only help medicine

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:16.301 align:middle line:84%
but also has the means
to help economically.

00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:18.137 align:middle line:84%
And the world needs
that as well.

00:22:18.137 --> 00:22:19.505 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's get into some of the
science, some of the testing

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.509 align:middle line:84%
that has been done,
the various areas.

00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:27.279 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Yeah, we did full
CBC panels work ups on it,

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
blood work, many years
of that with doctors

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.821 align:middle line:84%
where we would do the befores
and afters and done the scans

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:42.294 align:middle line:84%
from the MRI's to the
spec scans, the PET scans,

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to the ultrasounds
to the thermographs.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:45.597 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Befores and afters.

00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:46.965 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Befores and afters.

00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:49.168 align:middle line:84%
We've even done the
molecular biochemistry work

00:22:49.168 --> 00:22:53.906 align:middle line:84%
on the blood befores and afters
which is way on above that.

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.307 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's amazing.

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:58.877 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And everything was showed
change, everything was correct.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:02.414 align:middle line:84%
I mean they were seeing things
that could only have happened

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:05.417 align:middle line:84%
because they were
in the unit itself.

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:06.819 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: EEG's as well, right?

00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:08.153 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: EEG's as well.

00:23:08.153 --> 00:23:09.655 align:middle line:84%
We've done heart
rate variability--

00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:13.058 align:middle line:84%
heart rate variability is
now becoming a gold standard

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.593 align:middle line:90%
in the world of medicine.

00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:17.162 align:middle line:84%
A lot of doctors are
writing about it right now

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:20.933 align:middle line:84%
and I've been doing
that since 2002.

00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:24.703 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a group
and that had the machine,

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:26.472 align:middle line:90%
Doctors in Philadelphia.

00:23:26.472 --> 00:23:29.508 align:middle line:84%
So, we've seen a
lot of the changes.

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:32.878 align:middle line:84%
We-- we and you have to remember
when your working with energy

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:35.814 align:middle line:84%
in the human body a lot
of changes is subtle.

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:38.116 align:middle line:90%
It's not always physical.

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:41.186 align:middle line:84%
It's not always noticeable
to be metabolic.

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:43.489 align:middle line:84%
I mean thyroids can
change, hormones can change,

00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things in the
medical community, OK?

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.664 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of subtle
change that happens as well

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:57.569 align:middle line:84%
and that's based on the
emotional aspects of it.

00:23:57.569 --> 00:24:00.873 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about MIT,
some technology you came

00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:02.641 align:middle line:90%
about that started working well

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:06.078 align:middle line:84%
as a diagnostic--
a diagnostic tool.

00:24:06.078 --> 00:24:07.312 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:10.716 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And it was a machine
called Hansar [phonetic]

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:13.485 align:middle line:84%
and it was a group
out of Philadelphia.

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.153 align:middle line:90%
And it was created by MIT.

00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:17.122 align:middle line:84%
They did the software
work for them.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:20.759 align:middle line:84%
But in the creation of it, it
was about to collect raw data

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:23.195 align:middle line:84%
that actually showed the
autonomic nervous system

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:26.698 align:middle line:84%
of the sympathetic
per sympathetic sides.

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:31.236 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
see and watch change

00:24:31.236 --> 00:24:35.007 align:middle line:84%
as we were doing the Life
Vessels of the before and after,

00:24:35.007 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
21 days later, 3 or 4 months
later, you know, we had,

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.213 align:middle line:84%
we created baselines and
watched it all the way through.

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, you have left
more than a few doctors

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.752 align:middle line:90%
with their jaws hanging down.

00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:84%
You've left doctors even
saying I can't explain this.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.091 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how it worked.

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:55.994 align:middle line:84%
But just don't make those any
claims about this ever, right?

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.396 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:24:57.396 --> 00:24:59.531 align:middle line:84%
Well, and we tried never to do
that because were not doctors.

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:00.599 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.167 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And I didn't
need to be a doctor.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.101 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:04.303 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: If I take
you back one step

00:25:04.303 --> 00:25:05.971 align:middle line:84%
and as the body doesn't
know disease

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:07.272 align:middle line:90%
by name that's all I knew.

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:08.273 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's right.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.474 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: That's all
I needed to know.

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:13.245 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And this is called
a relaxation vessel--

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:15.581 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Yeah, it's a
relaxation device.

00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:16.682 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:20.886 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And so it wasn't
about making claims.

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:26.625 align:middle line:84%
But when you see change
you know and totals

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:29.361 align:middle line:90%
that it's happening, OK?

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.929 align:middle line:84%
And when you do blood
work and what have you

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:33.632 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors see it,
they know what's happening.

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:37.169 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, and really
it's in the sense,

00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:39.571 align:middle line:84%
it's not a very fair
process the way in which some

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:40.839 align:middle line:90%
of them become involved with you

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:44.042 align:middle line:84%
because they have patients
that are long gone.

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:44.977 align:middle line:90%
They've given up on.

00:25:44.977 --> 00:25:46.812 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more
they can do.

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:50.415 align:middle line:84%
So, they feel like, hey, well,
let just toss some his way

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.985 align:middle line:84%
because some of them actually,
we're trying to discredit you.

00:25:52.985 --> 00:25:54.052 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.387 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And giving you
the toughest cases

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.322 align:middle line:90%
that are still breathing.

00:25:57.322 --> 00:25:58.724 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:00.659 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And can you tell us just
about a couple of those cases

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:03.095 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to get
into a little David story

00:26:03.095 --> 00:26:05.263 align:middle line:90%
because such phenomenal

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:06.498 align:middle line:84%
to see what happened
to that little boy.

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
some hard like cases

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:84%
where people were beyond
stage 4 cancer and so forth.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:16.908 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, you know, we've
had them from William Syndrome's

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:18.543 align:middle line:90%
down to Gamete, you know.

00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:23.448 align:middle line:84%
I started with the cerebral
palsy kids because I knew that,

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:26.251 align:middle line:90%
it's basically nothing, OK?

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.987 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- they try to
make them feel better

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:33.291 align:middle line:84%
and some force manipulation
of movement in the body.

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:36.461 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times that
was very painful on them.

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, I started
with those and I--

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.999 align:middle line:84%
the mothers would come
and they would carpool up.

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And when I first started

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.569 align:middle line:84%
and we'd line eight
of them up at a time.

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:46.505 align:middle line:84%
And but we were suddenly
starting

00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:50.509 align:middle line:84%
to see protruding tongues
dropping back in the mouth.

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:53.145 align:middle line:84%
They don't hardly see
that with medicine.

00:26:53.145 --> 00:26:57.182 align:middle line:84%
And we were seeing hands
that had been rigid,

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:59.985 align:middle line:90%
locked up 15, 16 years.

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:01.953 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, mother is
sitting there crying

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.855 align:middle line:84%
because she's seen
the baby open her

00:27:03.855 --> 00:27:07.893 align:middle line:84%
that her young child opening
the hand by herself, by himself.

00:27:07.893 --> 00:27:11.196 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, we knew what was
the changes were happening.

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, so with that group
of mothers with cerebral palsy,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.169 align:middle line:84%
with the kids with
cerebral palsy,

00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
what kind of results
were you seeing

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.772 align:middle line:84%
after they stuck
with it for awhile?

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:24.343 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: We saw results
on every one of them.

00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:26.411 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
they don't have CP?

00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:28.113 align:middle line:84%
No, or does it mean they
have a better quality

00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:29.514 align:middle line:90%
of life at some level?

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:33.685 align:middle line:84%
Yes. It doesn't matter whether
that's Parkinson's, Cancer's,

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:36.254 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's, ALS, whatever.

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:39.791 align:middle line:84%
You're not always going
to cure, it's not to say

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:43.895 align:middle line:84%
that this is the cure for
everything because it's not.

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:47.799 align:middle line:84%
But it will make a difference
and it will change the quality

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.501 align:middle line:90%
of life at some level.

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, as this gets into
a lot of interesting things

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.171 align:middle line:90%
and you're not a woo-woo guy.

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.005 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:55.607 align:middle line:90%
You don't go there but I do.

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:56.308 align:middle line:90%
[laughs]

00:27:56.308 --> 00:27:57.542 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: I don't go there.

00:27:57.542 --> 00:28:00.645 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I look at it and
I'm thinking interesting

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:02.948 align:middle line:84%
because we all choose
experience, you know,

00:28:02.948 --> 00:28:05.884 align:middle line:84%
we choose our experience
in life and when we come

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:10.055 align:middle line:84%
into this physical reincarnation
in my way of thinking.

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:90%
There are no big surprises

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.926 align:middle line:84%
that the soul wasn't
aware before it signed up.

00:28:14.926 --> 00:28:19.397 align:middle line:84%
And so if you sign up, do you
have the experience of a body

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:22.768 align:middle line:84%
that has some kind of challenge
for some growth purpose

00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:26.171 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even to teach others
around you something magnificent

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:30.742 align:middle line:84%
about acceptance and love
that you can't like you say,

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:32.944 align:middle line:84%
you can't get rid of
the cerebral palsy,

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:36.782 align:middle line:84%
but you can make it much more
livable and in some cases almost

00:28:36.782 --> 00:28:38.016 align:middle line:90%
as though it's reversed.

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.217 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And there is always
the choice of the soul,

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.889 align:middle line:90%
the higher aspect of a being.

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:47.125 align:middle line:84%
As in terms of how far they
wish to take their own healing.

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:49.027 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: We are all
granted and given change.

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:50.061 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:51.496 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: So, whether
we create it or not.

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:52.631 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:28:52.631 --> 00:28:54.733 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And whether we
allow it and if we do,

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:56.268 align:middle line:90%
all things are possible.

00:28:56.268 --> 00:28:57.369 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:28:57.369 --> 00:28:59.137 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to-- this
is along that line.

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:02.974 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
the man who came to you

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:05.644 align:middle line:90%
with beyond stage 4 cancer.

00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
He, in fact, at 12-- they didn't
even know if he would live

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.117 align:middle line:84%
through the trip to
the clinic to do this.

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:15.453 align:middle line:84%
And what happened with him
because the soul still drives.

00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:16.121 align:middle line:90%
[laughs]

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:16.888 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Still drives.

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:18.223 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Drives the vehicle.

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:22.694 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: I had got a call one
day from a family in Utah

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:25.197 align:middle line:90%
and they told me the story.

00:29:25.197 --> 00:29:27.933 align:middle line:84%
And they've heard about the Life
Vessel and they wanted to try

00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:29.734 align:middle line:90%
and bring the gentlemen down.

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if he'd
make it, the trip or not,

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.107 align:middle line:84%
it was a 12 hour trip and they--
but they got him down there.

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:42.414 align:middle line:84%
We started treatment on him
and sessions and I think I did

00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:84%
about a month and a half
going on two months of them.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:47.619 align:middle line:84%
They stayed in Phoenix, they
didn't go back and forth.

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:50.455 align:middle line:84%
And he was on oxygen, a
lot of the pain pills,

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:52.858 align:middle line:84%
he's on the morphine's
and what you

00:29:52.858 --> 00:29:54.526 align:middle line:90%
that the pain was tremendous.

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:57.262 align:middle line:84%
He was ending stage 4
or they were terminal.

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:59.197 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They were trying to
treat so to speak anymore.

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:00.232 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah, they just--

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:01.633 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to do
anything they could.

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:09.007 align:middle line:84%
And he was due back for the next
go around and his wife called me

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:12.344 align:middle line:84%
and the day that they
were to be there she says,

00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:15.547 align:middle line:84%
"I have some bad news for you"
and so what she said, "Well,

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:18.683 align:middle line:84%
he wants-- the gentlemen wants
to go on home and he's asked me

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:21.119 align:middle line:90%
to call the kids to the house."

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.687 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, how was he
doing at this point?

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:23.955 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: He was doing good.

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:26.725 align:middle line:84%
He was-- we had-- the doctors
had got him way down off

00:30:26.725 --> 00:30:31.529 align:middle line:84%
of the pain medication and he
was communicating and he was,

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:35.467 align:middle line:84%
you know, where he
could actually be mobile

00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and in right mind
say and do things

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.906 align:middle line:90%
which he wasn't when we got him.

00:30:40.906 --> 00:30:43.909 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "I just don't
understand it, I wanted him

00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:47.012 align:middle line:84%
to keep going" and I said,
"You should take him home."

00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:48.914 align:middle line:84%
So, she did, they
called the family in,

00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:50.548 align:middle line:84%
all the kids were
able to come in,

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:53.351 align:middle line:84%
they spent time together
of about a week.

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.153 align:middle line:84%
And it was a Sunday
afternoon she said--

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:57.923 align:middle line:84%
or Sunday morning and he
was reading the paper,

00:30:57.923 --> 00:31:00.926 align:middle line:84%
one of the daughters was
in the shower and she was

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:02.827 align:middle line:84%
in the kitchen fixing
breakfast and he was

00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:04.095 align:middle line:90%
at the table reading the paper.

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.531 align:middle line:84%
And she said he all of a
sudden just looked over at her

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:08.633 align:middle line:84%
and smiled and he said,
"Its time for me to go now."

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.403 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it ended.

00:31:11.403 --> 00:31:12.971 align:middle line:90%
So, you don't--

00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:14.472 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Could have
shift your destiny.

00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:15.407 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: You know,
if you're going,

00:31:15.407 --> 00:31:17.142 align:middle line:84%
you're going, but
it's how you go.

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:20.745 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the thing is
Barry, we have so much

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:23.181 align:middle line:84%
as a species now
that were up against.

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:28.320 align:middle line:84%
When you look at just the
denigration of the food supply

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.757 align:middle line:84%
to say, nothing of GMO's or
besides pesticides, et cetera,

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:36.695 align:middle line:84%
eating bad food, food that's
toxic, drinking toxic water,

00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:41.733 align:middle line:84%
breathing toxic air, chemtrails
and whoever these beings are,

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:46.137 align:middle line:84%
these people are that perpetuate
this unto humanity know very

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:48.406 align:middle line:84%
well that were becoming
devitalized.

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:52.143 align:middle line:84%
So, it's not as though
you're taking away a person's

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:57.115 align:middle line:84%
so chosen path to-- in terms
of like this man with a cancer.

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:59.184 align:middle line:90%
It was his time to go.

00:31:59.184 --> 00:32:01.486 align:middle line:84%
He chose to go, he was
conscious, he worked things

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.355 align:middle line:84%
out with his family and he went,
he wouldn't have never have

00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:06.124 align:middle line:84%
that opportunity had he
not come to Life Vessel.

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:08.059 align:middle line:84%
The reality is we're
up against a lot

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:10.895 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I thought
this many times,

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:14.532 align:middle line:84%
where is some simple, beautiful
non-invasive technology

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:18.169 align:middle line:84%
that we can have access to to
help us get pass the things

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:21.439 align:middle line:84%
that are being literally
inflicted upon the human species

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:22.974 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:24.309 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:26.311 align:middle line:84%
Well, then that's
why I say, you know,

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
there's three things I
believe, take the body

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.715 align:middle line:90%
out of the balance state.

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.417 align:middle line:90%
That's emotional trauma,

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:34.352 align:middle line:84%
physical trauma and
environmental.

00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:35.687 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:37.922 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: You can put 10,000
things under that but it's one

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:39.657 align:middle line:90%
of those three categories.

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:43.061 align:middle line:90%
And so, it works in all areas

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:45.597 align:middle line:84%
if the body can put
itself in the right place.

00:32:45.597 --> 00:32:46.431 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Resonance is resonance.

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:47.766 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Resonance is resonance

00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:49.534 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, you've had a
lot of high profile scientist

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:50.802 align:middle line:84%
that have come through
there wouldn't you know--

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:52.303 align:middle line:84%
you need to go through
the list of names,

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:53.505 align:middle line:84%
you'd know a lot
of these people.

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:54.339 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They've been through--

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.508 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Well renowned people.

00:32:56.508 --> 00:32:58.243 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well renowned people,
but one was kind of interesting

00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:00.145 align:middle line:84%
because it was through
her end days.

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:02.147 align:middle line:90%
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross came in.

00:33:02.147 --> 00:33:03.214 align:middle line:90%
You didn't know who she was.

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:04.349 align:middle line:90%
I need an appointment.

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:07.018 align:middle line:84%
her people said she must
have an appointment now.

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:09.154 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, "I don't know
who she is and I'm booked,

00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.423 align:middle line:84%
I'm working 12 hours a
day" but she worked her in.

00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:14.626 align:middle line:84%
And after she went
through her session

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:18.663 align:middle line:84%
in the Life Vessel just tell
us what her response was to it.

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:21.533 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, we got ready to get
her out and of course in those

00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:24.302 align:middle line:84%
in days she was suffering with
a tremendous [inaudible] it was

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:28.373 align:middle line:84%
to where she could hardly even
touch her body was excruciating.

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:32.777 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to start
doing this and smile.

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:35.046 align:middle line:84%
And as we were getting her
out of the Life Vessel,

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:39.884 align:middle line:84%
she looked at me and she says,
"Young man, I've seen it all,

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:43.154 align:middle line:84%
I've done it all,
but you haven't.

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:45.023 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go have a tea."

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:46.724 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Isn't that--
what a validation?

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:47.926 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:33:47.926 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, you don't
know who she was exactly,

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.195 align:middle line:90%
but that was quite a validation.

00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:53.832 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: You know, when it
comes from us as you go on

00:33:53.832 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:90%
and you understand who they are.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.203 align:middle line:84%
It has great meaning
because she had seen,

00:33:58.203 --> 00:33:59.871 align:middle line:84%
she understood life
and death very well.

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.974 align:middle line:84%
She understood the technologies
and things that were

00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:04.142 align:middle line:90%
out there around the world.

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, she did.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.246 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And, you know, for
her to make comments based

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:13.851 align:middle line:84%
on her own physical
being of being in there,

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:16.588 align:middle line:90%
it has great meaning to it.

00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:20.425 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about--
just for a moment before we go

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:23.394 align:middle line:84%
into some of the stories that
I just love of what's happened.

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:25.363 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the remote
viewers that came on board.

00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:26.898 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Jack.

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:29.367 align:middle line:84%
What was with him, what
they-- and then just that--

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:33.637 align:middle line:84%
and there's a whole page
of some of the comments

00:34:33.637 --> 00:34:35.974 align:middle line:84%
that they made during their
remote viewing sessions.

00:34:35.974 --> 00:34:39.309 align:middle line:84%
But give us an overview of Jack
and what the remote viewers

00:34:39.309 --> 00:34:42.146 align:middle line:84%
in general were saying
were in consensus on?

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:45.517 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, Jack came
to me in the [inaudible]

00:34:45.517 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
and Jack was instrumental--
very instrumental with a lot

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.492 align:middle line:84%
of things in-- at high
levels, I'll say it that way.

00:34:54.492 --> 00:35:00.532 align:middle line:84%
And he was suffering from
diabetes and neuropathy very bad

00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:04.302 align:middle line:84%
and to a point where he did
a little video of his own

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:06.337 align:middle line:84%
after that we have
done treatments on him.

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:10.208 align:middle line:84%
And in his video he
says, he believes he died

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:12.844 align:middle line:84%
in the parking lot before we
brought him in to the building

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.913 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't understand
why we're putting him

00:35:14.913 --> 00:35:18.449 align:middle line:84%
in to a wood box in there
why he went at the hospital.

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But when he got out, he
was able to actually--

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.454 align:middle line:90%
in one treatment he get--

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:26.558 align:middle line:84%
prior to that he could hardly
touch his hands together.

00:35:26.558 --> 00:35:28.126 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that was just
excruciating [inaudible] there

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:30.195 align:middle line:90%
were tears would almost flow.

00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:33.798 align:middle line:84%
He was able to actually clap
his hands, he was able to--

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:34.999 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In one session then--

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.301 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: -- pick up his feet

00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and touch the floor whereas
before he would just have

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.138 align:middle line:90%
to shuffle.

00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:43.474 align:middle line:84%
So, we watch that and
over many years and during

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:47.011 align:middle line:84%
that time Jack had a lot of
influence of people and part

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:49.914 align:middle line:84%
of this was the remote
view in group.

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:53.117 align:middle line:84%
And they understood
physics a lot,

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.519 align:middle line:84%
different in a lot
of people and--

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:56.087 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But they did
not know that's target

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:57.689 align:middle line:84%
which they usually do
not know the target.

00:35:57.689 --> 00:35:59.057 align:middle line:90%
That's no point.

00:35:59.057 --> 00:36:01.693 align:middle line:84%
They have to view without having
any knowledge of what it is

00:36:01.693 --> 00:36:03.795 align:middle line:84%
and there's no frequency
of notion.

00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:04.729 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:07.131 align:middle line:84%
And they targeted
and wrote about.

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So-- and I think you
have the story or--

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:09.901 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:10.535 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: -- it's going to be--

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:11.769 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:13.137 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: -- generally, the
story from those gentleman.

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:17.442 align:middle line:84%
But they were always excited
because they knew after watching

00:36:17.442 --> 00:36:21.679 align:middle line:84%
with Jack that if you can
collectively bring someone

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:24.716 align:middle line:84%
to that conscious
level or that place

00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:26.551 align:middle line:84%
that all things are
possible and then--

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:29.387 align:middle line:84%
and they even believe they
could experience greater

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:31.823 align:middle line:84%
on what they were doing and
what they've done in the past.

00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:33.825 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because it does
alter consciousness as well.

00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:37.095 align:middle line:84%
And you had and when scientist a
well known man named Mr. Murray

00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:38.162 align:middle line:90%
[assumed spelling] who was there

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:39.998 align:middle line:84%
and he had a profound
breakthrough

00:36:39.998 --> 00:36:42.867 align:middle line:84%
in site while he was in the
chamber himself and he has a lot

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:43.701 align:middle line:90%
of influence in that--

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:44.535 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:45.803 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- scientific community.

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:46.671 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Dr. Murray [assumed
spelling] was a great man.

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:48.039 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, died
a few years ago.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: He's gone now but--

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.141 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:51.843 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about-- I want
to talk about little David just

00:36:51.843 --> 00:36:54.545 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a
profound experience

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:90%
that his body went through.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.584 align:middle line:84%
So, tell us a little bit about
how you first received him

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:02.687 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll see some pictures
as to how he progressed.

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:07.892 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: We had done sessions
with the lady in Phoenix

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:14.766 align:middle line:84%
and she had come upon David and
his mother at some conference

00:37:14.766 --> 00:37:16.167 align:middle line:84%
or something they
had in Phoenix.

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:21.439 align:middle line:84%
And so, she believed that maybe
Life Vessel could do something

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:90%
for David.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:27.312 align:middle line:84%
And David's mother was a single
mother going to school at ASU.

00:37:27.312 --> 00:37:32.283 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, you know,
no moneys, and, you know,

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:34.786 align:middle line:84%
difficult to even be in
school let along work

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:36.587 align:middle line:90%
with a child like David.

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:38.523 align:middle line:90%
And by the time he's 7 years old

00:37:38.523 --> 00:37:43.394 align:middle line:84%
and at time we got David he
already had 27 brain surgeries.

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:46.097 align:middle line:84%
And the medical community
had said,

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.799 align:middle line:90%
"Take him home and enjoy him.

00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:51.936 align:middle line:84%
It is what it is, there's
nothing more we can do for him."

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:56.107 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing one or
two or three seizures a week.

00:37:56.107 --> 00:38:00.578 align:middle line:84%
He was on five seizures
meds when we got him.

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.014 align:middle line:84%
He was at-- and there's a
video on it from the mother,

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:06.918 align:middle line:84%
but at seven he was still
in size 2 toddler clothes

00:38:06.918 --> 00:38:10.221 align:middle line:84%
and he weighed about 35,
40 pounds at the most.

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:11.422 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And he was completely--

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:15.393 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: He was contorted
and twisted, didn't talk,

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:18.296 align:middle line:84%
eyes were controlled,
facial structures,

00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:21.632 align:middle line:90%
no teeth at seven years old.

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:26.838 align:middle line:84%
And so, the lady angel there
with a car and we angel her

00:38:26.838 --> 00:38:29.707 align:middle line:84%
with the treatments of
David, and we did it.

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:32.009 align:middle line:84%
And in one year we
got to the point

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:33.344 align:middle line:84%
to where you see David
walk with a walker.

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:34.445 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And see this
in the final--

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:37.315 align:middle line:84%
with the walker with
a shining beautiful--

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.150 align:middle line:84%
physically coherent
looking being--

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.251 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Unbelievable.

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.519 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- other than
the need of a walker.

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:44.155 align:middle line:84%
And that's all he was
doing was just this--

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.423 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yup, yup.

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And in six months, we actually--
there's pictures of him,

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.863 align:middle line:84%
I took in six months, he
had teeth in his smiles.

00:38:51.863 --> 00:38:55.967 align:middle line:84%
And he had gained more weight
in six months than he had gained

00:38:55.967 --> 00:38:58.136 align:middle line:84%
in the first seven
years of his life.

00:38:58.136 --> 00:38:59.904 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, it's just--
that's an amazing story--

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.272 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.673 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- that body can do that
given the opportunity the--

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:06.644 align:middle line:84%
our own intelligence can do
that given the opportunity.

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:08.413 align:middle line:84%
You also did work
with Lyme disease.

00:39:08.413 --> 00:39:09.614 align:middle line:90%
This is a big one right now,

00:39:09.614 --> 00:39:12.517 align:middle line:84%
it's one that science
doesn't really--

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:13.785 align:middle line:84%
medicine doesn't
really know what to do

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:15.486 align:middle line:90%
with Lyme disease at this point.

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:19.123 align:middle line:84%
But what impressed
me was I saw in one

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:21.025 align:middle line:90%
of your video presentations.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:23.628 align:middle line:90%
You were showing the cells.

00:39:23.628 --> 00:39:26.731 align:middle line:84%
You were showing the cellular
structure of what was going

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:29.467 align:middle line:84%
on with Lyme disease
which of course is this--

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.202 align:middle line:90%
or this clumpy--

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.136 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: The [inaudible].

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:32.904 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- sticky--

00:39:32.904 --> 00:39:34.138 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Quite so.

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:37.074 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, chains of
cells all clumped together.

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:40.878 align:middle line:84%
And then, you showed the
after-- the cells after, right?

00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Two treatments
18 hours later.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.482 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Two treatments 18 hours.

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:46.317 align:middle line:84%
It looked like brand
new fresh blood.

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:84%
All the cells were round
and perfect and detached

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.422 align:middle line:84%
from one another and
I thought, really?

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:52.423 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:53.424 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Did that really
happen that way?

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:54.659 align:middle line:90%
And you just--

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:56.961 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: The doctors were
surprised to see it as well.

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.362 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: [Laughs] I
supposed they were.

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean I know some people who
deal with live blood analysis

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.968 align:middle line:90%
and do various therapies

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:07.872 align:middle line:84%
but usually it doesn't
happen that fast if it all.

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:08.706 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:09.373 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Especially, Lyme disease.

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.441 align:middle line:90%
That's a tough one.

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.843 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And that was
what we were seeing.

00:40:11.843 --> 00:40:16.013 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is-- it's, you know,
whether we talked the language,

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:19.283 align:middle line:84%
we don't talk the language but
it's like a work speed, OK?

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:21.752 align:middle line:90%
And the body, when it's

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:24.522 align:middle line:84%
in balance state,
it's at work speed.

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:29.427 align:middle line:84%
It signal and things throughout
the entire body and to the cells

00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:32.997 align:middle line:84%
and communicating and
synopsis are going on.

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:37.268 align:middle line:84%
And so, it has to be
firing in perfect order--

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.369 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: -- to things
to function correctly.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.875 align:middle line:84%
But you it can send signals, I
mean like speed that's on time--

00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:47.178 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Faster than the
speed of light, exactly.

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:47.745 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: -- he just [inaudible]

00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:48.379 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.747 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: You know--

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:50.748 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And we also-- because
of the environmental factors,

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:52.283 align:middle line:84%
there is sometimes
when I know the--

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:54.485 align:middle line:84%
when the technicians
are in the room.

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.554 align:middle line:84%
They come in the room at
the end of the session.

00:40:56.554 --> 00:41:03.528 align:middle line:84%
The room can just smell horrific
with the off-gassing in the body

00:41:03.528 --> 00:41:08.366 align:middle line:84%
of metals of urea, of all kinds
of different things that are--

00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:10.935 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: We actually get the
detox coming out cellular level.

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.336 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:13.671 align:middle line:84%
And I know I was talking to Gale
[assumed spelling] and she said

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:15.873 align:middle line:84%
that it's almost unbearable
to be in the room sometimes

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:18.442 align:middle line:84%
when someone has
really heavy toxicity

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:21.279 align:middle line:84%
as the whole room smells of
it after just one session.

00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:24.015 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a key, I
mean, you're letting a lot

00:41:24.015 --> 00:41:25.383 align:middle line:90%
of stuff loose in the body.

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:26.517 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:29.053 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so, what's
the antidote to that?

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:31.989 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: The antidote is you
got to drink a lot of water

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:34.559 align:middle line:90%
to help couple of things.

00:41:34.559 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:90%
You work with energy medicine,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.597 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep the body
hydrated, cells hydrated,

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:42.266 align:middle line:84%
but you also had to flush the
body 'cause we're dumping a lot

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:45.169 align:middle line:84%
of free radicals and what have
you into the blood stream.

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.238 align:middle line:90%
So, we have to get it out.

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:51.609 align:middle line:84%
So, we asked if they'd be
able to intake some more close

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:54.278 align:middle line:84%
to the gallon of water in
24 hours during the time

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:56.480 align:middle line:84%
of treatments and five
to seven days afterward.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.184 align:middle line:84%
And then they start to
get and the only downside

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:84%
of the Life Vessel at all is
if they get a little nauseated

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.656 align:middle line:84%
or headache is they're
not getting enough water.

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:06.924 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:08.859 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: So, the intake has
to be bulked up and then--

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:11.028 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Right and it flashes
out sometimes electrolytes--

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:11.729 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- and all that.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.497 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:14.932 align:middle line:84%
There was one fellow
that came through--

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:17.234 align:middle line:84%
I believe his name
is Ronald, right?

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:18.836 align:middle line:90%
Ronald came through.

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:21.939 align:middle line:84%
He had been exposed
to depleted uranium--

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:23.007 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right, go for syndrome.

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:25.409 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- in the
military, go for syndrome.

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:28.946 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- I mean, he thought
it was OK, went in to have labs

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:31.182 align:middle line:84%
and found out everything
was wrong.

00:42:31.182 --> 00:42:32.116 align:middle line:90%
All these things were--

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:33.217 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: They were shut down.

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:34.352 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, he was
ready to start having--

00:42:34.352 --> 00:42:36.287 align:middle line:90%
manifesting serious problems.

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:38.856 align:middle line:84%
And he came to Life Vessel
and we're going to take a clip

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:42.460 align:middle line:84%
of a video because he wanted to
do testimonial for Life Vessel

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.294 align:middle line:90%
because of his experience.

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:44.261 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right, right.

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:45.429 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, let's
take a look at that.

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Ronald: My first
visit to the Life Vessel,

00:42:47.465 --> 00:42:52.069 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Gale will explain how
that works for you that I went

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.938 align:middle line:90%
through the initial process,

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:56.874 align:middle line:84%
I went through four
treatments, one hour treatments.

00:42:56.874 --> 00:43:00.311 align:middle line:84%
And following that first
four treatments, I returned

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:04.415 align:middle line:84%
and had additional blood work
done probably four weeks later,

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:06.217 align:middle line:84%
they recommended four--
four and a half weeks later.

00:43:06.217 --> 00:43:10.688 align:middle line:84%
And my doctor scratch his head
and all of these levels my ALT's

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:14.291 align:middle line:84%
and AST's, my ferritin
levels, my bilirubin count,

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:21.232 align:middle line:84%
my hematocrit levels, all of
that had either come down to

00:43:21.232 --> 00:43:23.968 align:middle line:84%
within normal levels
or just above level--

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:27.538 align:middle line:84%
normal levels where
before some were even close

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:30.775 align:middle line:84%
to double what they should have
been as levels in the body.

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:34.845 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, is quietly
pleasing of the course, and he,

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:38.149 align:middle line:84%
you know, I asked him too I
said, "You know, I understand

00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:39.583 align:middle line:84%
that some people
don't understand--

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:42.486 align:middle line:84%
don't appreciate
alternative treatments

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.121 align:middle line:90%
or how they may work."

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:45.389 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Is there any way

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:47.558 align:middle line:84%
that his could be a
placebo effect, you know,

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:50.494 align:middle line:84%
did I go into this very
neutral, not really knowing

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:54.131 align:middle line:84%
if this is going to help or not
but with an open mind hoping

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:58.102 align:middle line:84%
of course that it would shed
some light on or relieve me

00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:00.805 align:middle line:90%
of these health issues.

00:44:00.805 --> 00:44:02.773 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "To be honest when
your dealing with this type

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:04.575 align:middle line:84%
of blood work and
ferritin levels,

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.677 align:middle line:84%
things like that
your mind, of course,

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:08.212 align:middle line:84%
we don't know exactly
what the mind can do.

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:13.017 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, placebo effect
can't control the levels

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.586 align:middle line:84%
of these, you know,
enzymes and these proteins

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:16.721 align:middle line:90%
and aminos in your body.

00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:18.456 align:middle line:84%
So, he said, "I don't
know what your doing,

00:44:18.456 --> 00:44:20.691 align:middle line:90%
but whatever it is keep it up."

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:25.629 align:middle line:84%
So, I returned to the Life
Vessel a couple of years later

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:28.566 align:middle line:84%
for another treatment,
but still feeling well.

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to do at least
a maintenance to stay on this.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably
in 2004 was my last--

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:36.974 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.175 align:middle line:84%
And that's with--
and I bring this

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:40.144 align:middle line:90%
up for another reason entirely.

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:44.515 align:middle line:84%
We're talking depleted
uranium, OK?

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:50.788 align:middle line:84%
The body somehow managed, what
did it do with the uranium?

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:54.825 align:middle line:84%
How did it manage to release
itself from the effects of it?

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Again, it's based on
the detox at a cellular level.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:06.036 align:middle line:84%
So, in his case, he was actually
on a liver transplant list.

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:08.038 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh, wow, I
didn't know that, yeah.

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.106 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: So, yeah.

00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:11.475 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when
he first came to us.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:14.912 align:middle line:90%
And within the first 30 days,

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.481 align:middle line:84%
his blood work took
him out of that.

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:24.622 align:middle line:84%
And so the detox,
it's very quick detox,

00:45:24.622 --> 00:45:26.557 align:middle line:84%
but its one that
the body can handle

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.325 align:middle line:90%
because it's a natural detox.

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:31.061 align:middle line:84%
It's not like something
that's being forced

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:38.369 align:middle line:84%
or outside product that's given
to detox liver or what have you.

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, but his story what
I recall is that after a number

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.510 align:middle line:84%
of years, he went back and
had some blood work done,

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:50.481 align:middle line:84%
he was starting to get slightly
elevated readings in some

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.683 align:middle line:90%
of the areas just very slightly.

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:54.018 align:middle line:84%
But that was after
a lot of years.

00:45:54.018 --> 00:45:54.718 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:55.553 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: That was 7 years.

00:45:55.553 --> 00:45:56.387 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That was 7 years later.

00:45:56.387 --> 00:45:57.621 align:middle line:90%
So, and then he can just come in

00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and have it tied
it back up again.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.894 align:middle line:84%
How-- what are the lasting
elements in terms of the effects

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:05.963 align:middle line:84%
of this, I mean, that
is a lasting effect

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:09.099 align:middle line:90%
or is it need boost or what?

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:12.069 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: You always
need to help the body

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:13.938 align:middle line:84%
because there's always something
that's going to take it

00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:15.239 align:middle line:90%
out of that balance state.

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:16.841 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, we're just living.

00:46:16.841 --> 00:46:18.142 align:middle line:90%
[laughs]

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.443 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: You know, you get one
cold and you get over it,

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:20.311 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean you're never
going to get another one.

00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:21.545 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:23.514 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: If you get a
weakness on the immune system

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:26.217 align:middle line:84%
or you get a traumanization
to the body,

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:29.019 align:middle line:84%
something can trigger
the body to breakdown.

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:31.555 align:middle line:84%
And that's when,
we'll get a call

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:33.224 align:middle line:84%
from somebody we haven't
seen in a year and you say,

00:46:33.224 --> 00:46:34.558 align:middle line:84%
"You know what, I
need to get back in."

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:36.594 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:46:36.594 --> 00:46:39.496 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the body
going out of balance.

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:40.631 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:43.767 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And that's when
the body gets tested in

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:47.771 align:middle line:84%
and either it gets through
it or it gets disease.

00:46:47.771 --> 00:46:48.272 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:49.373 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: OK.

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:51.108 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, he had--
would you do in clusters

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:53.444 align:middle line:84%
of within three days
they do four sessions

00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:54.845 align:middle line:90%
and then can't do anymore?

00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:58.949 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: They wait 21 to 25 days
based on we know from blood work

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.684 align:middle line:84%
that the body is
still doing changes

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:02.052 align:middle line:90%
between that period of time.

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.787 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And is that what
he had done just one--

00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:04.889 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: He did--

00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:05.723 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- cluster of
four or did he did two?

00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: He did a total of nine.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.524 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: A total of nine?

00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:08.592 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:10.094 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that set
him for seven years,

00:47:10.094 --> 00:47:14.798 align:middle line:84%
got rid of the depleted uranium
because, you know, I read a lot

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.567 align:middle line:90%
of information that flows

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:19.570 align:middle line:84%
through the non-traditional
channels.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.273 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of
information that surfacing now

00:47:22.273 --> 00:47:24.842 align:middle line:84%
through people that I have
a great amount of respect

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:27.811 align:middle line:84%
for that we are being exposed to
much larger amounts of radiation

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:29.213 align:middle line:90%
than we had thought we were.

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.782 align:middle line:84%
And now there are some things we
can do to help chelate that out

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:33.817 align:middle line:84%
of the body, you
know, using algae's

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.920 align:middle line:90%
and green things and so forth.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.756 align:middle line:84%
But what I wasn't thinking
about is this seems

00:47:38.756 --> 00:47:42.326 align:middle line:84%
like an ideal thing to help
start the detox of some

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:45.195 align:middle line:84%
of the radiation that we've
all been exposed to by now.

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:46.196 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Right.

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:48.365 align:middle line:84%
Right. That and--
and the other guys

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:50.834 align:middle line:84%
that are coming home
now, the PTS detox.

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:52.503 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, that is very sad.

00:47:52.503 --> 00:47:53.871 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: That's a whole
another thing, you know?

00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:58.409 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: To send them over
into an ungodly circumstance

00:47:58.409 --> 00:48:02.446 align:middle line:84%
to risk their lives and go under
that daily stress and come back

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:05.449 align:middle line:84%
with absolutely nothing
except a little counseling.

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:06.817 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work, I mean, what--

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:08.786 align:middle line:84%
have you seen, have you
used this with that?

00:48:08.786 --> 00:48:09.353 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: We have.

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:10.154 align:middle line:90%
We have.

00:48:10.154 --> 00:48:11.088 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What are the things?

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:12.523 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: We've had
excellent success.

00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:14.959 align:middle line:84%
We have several testimonials
about it

00:48:14.959 --> 00:48:16.794 align:middle line:90%
from the individuals themselves.

00:48:16.794 --> 00:48:18.162 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:48:18.162 --> 00:48:20.864 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: But, you know, again,
it's about being able to release

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:25.636 align:middle line:84%
that cell memory, being able
to process and not always have

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:29.039 align:middle line:84%
to go back into recognition
of it, but to eliminate it.

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:32.343 align:middle line:84%
And that's the difference
with the Life Vessel.

00:48:32.343 --> 00:48:34.478 align:middle line:90%
If they can detox, reset,

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:40.384 align:middle line:84%
rebalance then the body can come
back into a flowing situation.

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:42.853 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You've said that
there are some hospitals

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:45.089 align:middle line:84%
that are starting to explore
this because you have a lot

00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:47.891 align:middle line:84%
of MD's that have now either
worked with you directly

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:50.794 align:middle line:84%
or have had clients come that
they couldn't help any further.

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:53.263 align:middle line:84%
So, you're having your
validation from the world

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:55.666 align:middle line:84%
of medicine for those who
aren't just being mean

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:56.967 align:middle line:90%
about the whole thing.

00:48:56.967 --> 00:49:00.904 align:middle line:84%
But what about getting it
more into an institution--

00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:03.841 align:middle line:84%
institutionalized settings such
as, I mean, I agree with you,

00:49:03.841 --> 00:49:05.476 align:middle line:90%
it's like every military base

00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:07.077 align:middle line:84%
that processes soldiers
coming back,

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:08.178 align:middle line:90%
so they have a hundred of them.

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.179 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.114 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Just get these
guys in there.

00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:11.048 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Should be
on the front lines

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.182 align:middle line:84%
and may come back
in the evening.

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:13.283 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They should be

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:14.251 align:middle line:84%
in the front lines get
rid of the Uranium.

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.652 align:middle line:84%
They have that stuff
on the warheads.

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Just this trauma.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.922 align:middle line:84%
Just let go all of
the day's trauma.

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:19.556 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:20.891 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: You know.

00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:25.996 align:middle line:84%
Our safety departments where
they can't take medication,

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:30.067 align:middle line:84%
you know, our police
departments, our firemen, our--

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:31.769 align:middle line:84%
you can't be on all
the medications

00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:35.172 align:middle line:84%
that alter how they
think and what they do.

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Antidepressants
and all that.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.575 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: If they could just detox

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:41.512 align:middle line:84%
with this just the
emotional side.

00:49:41.512 --> 00:49:43.347 align:middle line:90%
Forget about everything else.

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.315 align:middle line:90%
Just deal with stress.

00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.717 align:middle line:84%
It will make a world
of difference.

00:49:46.717 --> 00:49:48.218 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, that's the thing
people when they come out of it

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.720 align:middle line:90%
and say they feel euphoric.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.387 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:51.688 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I mean I did.

00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:55.659 align:middle line:84%
I felt wonderfully mildly
euphoric and it carried on.

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.127 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: No road rage
on the way home.

00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:00.464 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: No, no, gosh, no, I
was flying, it felt great.

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:03.067 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I mean that's
just the emotional level

00:50:03.067 --> 00:50:05.369 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking at--
well, first of all,

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:10.441 align:middle line:84%
I just posted an article from
a doctor who before he died,

00:50:10.441 --> 00:50:12.142 align:middle line:84%
just before he died
made a confession

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:15.245 align:middle line:84%
into their Spiegel Magazine in
Germany, he was an American.

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:20.217 align:middle line:84%
He was part of the team
that trumped up a disease,

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:24.188 align:middle line:84%
disease called ADHD,
right, so it never was.

00:50:24.188 --> 00:50:28.158 align:middle line:84%
They just made it up because
once you can do that and get it

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:32.262 align:middle line:84%
into the proper manuals,
right, for treatment,

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:35.265 align:middle line:84%
now you have a huge industry
with something like, what,

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:38.602 align:middle line:84%
50 percent or more of the
kids on one kind or, well,

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:42.706 align:middle line:84%
certainly of all of us on
some form of antidepressant

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.108 align:middle line:90%
or mood alternating drug.

00:50:44.108 --> 00:50:48.912 align:middle line:84%
What about kids and what
was called ADHD or autism?

00:50:48.912 --> 00:50:50.881 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: We've seen a
lot of improvement

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.149 align:middle line:90%
with the kids like that.

00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:53.650 align:middle line:84%
We've done a lot of
work with the kids.

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:57.421 align:middle line:84%
There are several testimony
from, excuse me, from mothers

00:50:57.421 --> 00:51:01.925 align:middle line:84%
that the children were failing
in school or they were afraid

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:04.394 align:middle line:84%
to the kids, they
were on medication.

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:07.998 align:middle line:84%
And we would do the sessions on
them and suddenly within a month

00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:10.100 align:middle line:84%
or two the kids are
on the A honor roll,

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.168 align:middle line:90%
the kids are back into--

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.137 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The natural genius.

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Where they can
communicate with the family.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.242 align:middle line:84%
They can sit it out in
the table, you know?

00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:19.476 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Even autism?

00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:22.179 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: In a lot of the
autistic kids can interact.

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I've had some of
the kids are back

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.217 align:middle line:84%
in a mainstream type
schools feeding themselves,

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:30.053 align:middle line:84%
taking care of themselves,
but they still carry the label

00:51:30.053 --> 00:51:36.960 align:middle line:84%
of autism, but huge changes,
unbelievable changes.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.328 align:middle line:90%
Tourette's was another big one.

00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:40.097 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, Tourette's.

00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:41.465 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Yeah.

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:45.035 align:middle line:84%
And there's many stories of
different forms that are common

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:48.739 align:middle line:84%
and they're all unbelievable,
I mean, it's just--

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:53.343 align:middle line:84%
there was one that I always
talk about is the family

00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:59.349 align:middle line:84%
from Nashville and Sam
was seven when I got in.

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:03.387 align:middle line:84%
And Tourette's so bad that he,
all the time he just wanted

00:52:03.387 --> 00:52:05.155 align:middle line:84%
to take his head
and go like this.

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So, that it, he knew
his brain wasn't going

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.158 align:middle line:90%
to fall out the other side.

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:10.961 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been everywhere
from Vanderbilt

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:13.397 align:middle line:90%
to every hospital out there.

00:52:13.397 --> 00:52:14.831 align:middle line:84%
And they tried everything
they could

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:17.367 align:middle line:84%
and there was really
nothing working.

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:22.005 align:middle line:84%
And I-- they brought him to
me and his mother came sharing

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:25.409 align:middle line:84%
and they-- we start doing
the sessions on him.

00:52:25.409 --> 00:52:29.413 align:middle line:84%
And we had done about
12 or 15 over a couple

00:52:29.413 --> 00:52:30.848 align:middle line:90%
of month's period of time.

00:52:30.848 --> 00:52:34.985 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one, I
mean from the beginning

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:37.387 align:middle line:84%
to getting close to
the end, Sam had--

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:40.224 align:middle line:84%
the Tourette's had slowed
down, slowed down, slowed down.

00:52:40.224 --> 00:52:42.593 align:middle line:84%
And where he could sit in front
of a computer and look at it

00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:44.361 align:middle line:84%
without laying his
head flat on the table.

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the last treatment,
they were getting ready to leave

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:49.933 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Sharon, let's
do one more" and so we did.

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.168 align:middle line:90%
And I let her come in the room

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:52.603 align:middle line:84%
as we were getting
ready to get Sam out.

00:52:52.603 --> 00:52:55.172 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you open it
up and you look in there

00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:58.175 align:middle line:84%
and you see your child laying
there and they're out, you know,

00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:00.644 align:middle line:84%
mother sometimes bring
tears to their eyes and--

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:01.945 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because they're
still, they're [inaudible].

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:04.448 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: It's just-- it's, you
know, something they have

00:53:04.448 --> 00:53:09.253 align:middle line:84%
to process and Sam when he
came awake, conscious of it,

00:53:09.253 --> 00:53:12.289 align:middle line:84%
and we were there, he looked
over his mother and he says,

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:14.124 align:middle line:90%
"Mom, why are you crying?"

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:17.394 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Oh, Sam,
it's OK, it's no problem."

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:20.197 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Yeah but mom,
don't worry", she said,

00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:21.531 align:middle line:90%
"I'll be all right, Sam."

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:25.736 align:middle line:84%
She said, "No" but I saw such
and such and it was a name

00:53:25.736 --> 00:53:26.937 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't know who that was

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:29.806 align:middle line:84%
and then he said,
"It's doing fine."

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:34.511 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw grampy
[phonetic] and he's doing fine.

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.680 align:middle line:84%
He got out of the Life
Vessel, went out, went outside

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.949 align:middle line:84%
and started playing,
Tourette's was over.

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:41.318 align:middle line:84%
I asked Sharon in the
room afterward I said,

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:42.686 align:middle line:90%
"What was that all about?"

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:46.657 align:middle line:84%
She said, "When Sam was four,
the first name was his dog,

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:50.227 align:middle line:84%
he lost the dog, right after
that, he lost his grandfather

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:51.962 align:middle line:84%
that had raised him and
then Tourette's started."

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:56.233 align:middle line:84%
When he came into recognition
with it and the treatments

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:58.435 align:middle line:84%
and to this day, Sam has
graduated high school,

00:53:58.435 --> 00:53:59.803 align:middle line:84%
he's in college playing
football.

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:04.541 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, what joy, not just
for the mothers but for you.

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:05.509 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: What are those
worth, you know?

00:54:05.509 --> 00:54:07.144 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh, yeah,
what is that worth?

00:54:07.144 --> 00:54:08.612 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: What are those worth?

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:11.281 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And this is
also being combined--

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:14.184 align:middle line:84%
I'm just tossing this
out there, for example,

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:17.421 align:middle line:84%
what about stem cell therapy
that it's just now coming

00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:20.691 align:middle line:84%
to fruition, how does
this maybe augment--

00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:25.629 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: What it augment that I
work with doctor who was kind

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:29.666 align:middle line:84%
of leading up there in the
world of the stem cells

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:34.304 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to happen
is that when the body's

00:54:34.304 --> 00:54:38.442 align:middle line:84%
in a harmonious state
and in a balance state,

00:54:38.442 --> 00:54:41.878 align:middle line:84%
the transplants work
even greater.

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:46.717 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that on some
of the bone marrow transplants

00:54:46.717 --> 00:54:48.585 align:middle line:84%
to where we've done
a [inaudible]

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:50.754 align:middle line:84%
where they're been doing Life
Vessel [inaudible] as much

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:54.391 align:middle line:84%
as got an infection let alone
a rejection doesn't happen very

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:57.027 align:middle line:84%
often, there is usually
something that's

00:54:57.027 --> 00:55:02.132 align:middle line:84%
if the body fights off and
so there, she is very excited

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:04.134 align:middle line:84%
about it to try and
integrate that into some

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:06.303 align:middle line:84%
of the new research that's
getting ready to go on.

00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:07.137 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:08.338 align:middle line:90%
And you have some other-- Dr.

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:09.339 align:middle line:84%
Christine Horner [assumed
spelling] is a big fan

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:10.173 align:middle line:90%
of your work.

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:11.441 align:middle line:90%
I heard an interview with her

00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:13.243 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Mercola [assumed
spelling] actually talking

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:15.345 align:middle line:84%
about the Life Vessel and
she has a great hope for it

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:17.147 align:middle line:84%
with breast cancer
and many others.

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:19.449 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are a lot of
doctors on board with this.

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.219 align:middle line:84%
But why aren't we seeing or
are there in some in hospitals,

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:24.020 align:middle line:84%
you don't have that
many out there--

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.555 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: We don't have them here.

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:28.225 align:middle line:90%
You know, you have to bring--

00:55:28.225 --> 00:55:33.930 align:middle line:84%
in our society, in the world we
live in, it's a sort of process,

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:37.734 align:middle line:84%
nothing's overnight even to
bringing out a new medication.

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.803 align:middle line:90%
It's a long drawn up process.

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:42.406 align:middle line:84%
You want to do it right, you
want to make no mistakes.

00:55:42.406 --> 00:55:45.008 align:middle line:84%
You want to get everybody
on board to work for it

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:48.578 align:middle line:84%
and for everyone including the
doctors and medical community.

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:52.082 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, we're
trying to do it in a way

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:55.185 align:middle line:84%
where they become the
ones that bring it,

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.853 align:middle line:90%
they're involved with us.

00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:59.356 align:middle line:84%
And once we, you
know, we break that to

00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:01.024 align:middle line:84%
where our mainstream
starts asking

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:03.160 align:middle line:90%
for it then it will get there.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.561 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.496 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you just think of
the burden there under it too.

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:09.132 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
just the patient,

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:12.102 align:middle line:84%
the doctor being stressed
out by age or most

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:14.171 align:middle line:84%
to seek clients every
seven minutes.

00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:15.505 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: Oh, yeah.

00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:16.873 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Just-- I mean to have
a private practice is almost

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:19.976 align:middle line:84%
insane simply because
of the insurance one has

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:21.878 align:middle line:90%
to carry from malpractice.

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:25.649 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems to
me that technologies

00:56:25.649 --> 00:56:31.221 align:middle line:84%
like this could literally
revive medical practice again

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:35.025 align:middle line:84%
and encourage people to go into
that field that are feeling now

00:56:35.025 --> 00:56:37.861 align:middle line:84%
so beaten up once they
get out of medical school.

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:41.198 align:middle line:84%
How do you see that interfacing
with the new wave of medicine

00:56:41.198 --> 00:56:43.633 align:middle line:90%
and new doctors coming in?

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:47.304 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: It's going to
enhance that and, you know,

00:56:47.304 --> 00:56:50.440 align:middle line:84%
they're now being the
curriculums, being taught

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.476 align:middle line:84%
in some of the major
universities

00:56:52.476 --> 00:56:54.978 align:middle line:84%
of the alternative
sides of medicine.

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:56.279 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have that before.

00:56:56.279 --> 00:56:59.182 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, it wasn't out
there, it's now starting

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:01.451 align:middle line:84%
to become a part of
what they're taught.

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:05.622 align:middle line:84%
So, as that moves forward,
it's going to get easier.

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:09.192 align:middle line:84%
And as you can take that burden
of liability from a doctor

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:12.362 align:middle line:84%
which I don't want
their position at all.

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.463 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:14.764 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And none of us
would like for that

00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:16.366 align:middle line:90%
and I don't envy them a bit.

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:20.203 align:middle line:84%
But if they can do
things that can speed up

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:24.441 align:middle line:84%
and when they start medicine
their whole premise of it is

00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:26.843 align:middle line:84%
to do no harm and do
the best they can.

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:27.878 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:57:27.878 --> 00:57:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: The quickest
they can that in--

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.149 align:middle line:90%
without the expense, they can.

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:36.419 align:middle line:84%
That's what they start
with but as it goes

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:40.490 align:middle line:84%
on it can sometimes change from
that from outside pressures

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.993 align:middle line:84%
and forces in different
parts of medicine.

00:57:42.993 --> 00:57:48.431 align:middle line:84%
So, anything, they can do to
enhance what they're doing,

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:52.736 align:middle line:84%
to get their patients in
a better state of wellness

00:57:52.736 --> 00:57:57.340 align:middle line:84%
without doing harm
only make sense.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And in today's world,
we have to look at it.

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:04.648 align:middle line:84%
Its how we're going to survive
where we're going in society,

00:58:04.648 --> 00:58:06.716 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to correct
the emotional parts

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:07.918 align:middle line:90%
that we live with, we got

00:58:07.918 --> 00:58:11.821 align:middle line:84%
to correct the toxicity
aspects of it.

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:15.725 align:middle line:84%
Physical, you know, we can
take pain out of the body,

00:58:15.725 --> 00:58:17.360 align:middle line:84%
we always going to
need the doctor's

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.795 align:middle line:84%
to set the bones
and what have you.

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, for
trauma, absolutely.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.933 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And surgeries
in different things.

00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:25.669 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, they're
using it in Korea.

00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:27.037 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: We have it
in Seoul, Korea.

00:58:27.037 --> 00:58:27.871 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And China?

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:28.905 align:middle line:90%
And what about China, I know--

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: We're not there yet.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.841 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Koreans are very much
more advanced when it comes

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:33.977 align:middle line:84%
to understanding energy
and the healing matrix.

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:36.279 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: Well, they believe
they understand the inability

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:37.247 align:middle line:90%
of the body has--

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:38.014 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.015 align:middle line:90%
>> BM: -- to well itself.

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:41.451 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: So, they're
very open to it.

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:44.354 align:middle line:84%
Eastern medicines
very open to it.

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:47.357 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're talking with
some doctors and groups

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:52.062 align:middle line:84%
in China right now and working
with some doctors in Germany,

00:58:52.062 --> 00:58:54.664 align:middle line:84%
Germany's kind of
a leading edge up,

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:57.100 align:middle line:90%
some new aspects of medicine.

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.201 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I'm glad to hear that.

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:01.404 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm just so
thrilled that you have--

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:03.173 align:middle line:84%
that you got your download
that you're putting it

00:59:03.173 --> 00:59:04.507 align:middle line:90%
out there in the world.

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:08.678 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I really-- I'm
very grateful that you chose

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:13.516 align:middle line:84%
to start coming out with this
now and joining us here today.

00:59:13.516 --> 00:59:15.285 align:middle line:90%
I hope you feel safe,

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:17.954 align:middle line:84%
I hope [laughs] you felt
safe during the interview.

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And I just wished you
the greatest and I plan

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.958 align:middle line:90%
on going in for a set myself.

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:24.394 align:middle line:84%
Why not get off to my
straight, who knows what's going

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.528 align:middle line:90%
on under [laughs] the skin.

00:59:25.528 --> 00:59:27.297 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: And I thank you
for the opportunity

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.566 align:middle line:90%
and I believe the time is right.

00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:30.934 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> BM: I believe what you all
have here is an opportunity

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.505 align:middle line:90%
to bring it the right way.

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:41.244 align:middle line:84%
And I've waited for that and
if that combination is correct,

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:43.046 align:middle line:84%
it'll make sense to
the people watching.

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:45.281 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You can go
to the website,

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:48.718 align:middle line:84%
lifevesseloftherockies.com
for further information

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:50.387 align:middle line:90%
as to accessing the Life Vessel

00:59:50.387 --> 00:59:51.955 align:middle line:84%
for yourself for
your loved ones.

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:54.958 align:middle line:84%
There are only a couple of
dozen that exist at this point,

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.292 align:middle line:90%
so you may have to travel,

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:58.294 align:middle line:84%
but its well worth
the time and money.

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:02.298 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
