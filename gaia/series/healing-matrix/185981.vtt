>> Too often we are
too sick, too tired,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:10%
and too addicted to live

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Millions of Americans
struggle with toxicity

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
addiction and
chemical dependency.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:84%
We spend millions of
dollars every year

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
from smoking

But what if the key to wellness
was natural, inexpensive,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and available in
your own backyard?

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Today, we will hear
from Brigitte Mars.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Brigitte is a master herbalist
and nutritional consultant

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
of natural health with
50 years of experience.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
She teaches herbal medicine
at Naropa University

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and the School of Health
Mastery in Iceland.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.175 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Brigitte,
to "Healing Matrix."

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure and honor.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Dr. Sue.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell us just a
little bit about your story?

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.303 align:middle line:90%
How did you become an herbalist?

00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:90%
What got you here?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have to say it was my
French Canadian grandmother who

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.108 align:middle line:90%
inspired me.

00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:10%
She didn't call
herself an herbalist,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:10%
but she was so wise and used
all these folk remedies, which

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:10%
I loved, that folk remedies
were medicine for the people.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
was in high school,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I was just turning all my
class papers and projects

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
into a way of learning
more about plant medicine.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I lived for two and
1/2 years and ate

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:90%
nothing but wild edible plants.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I've had many teachers
along the way--

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Michael Tierra,
Christopher Hobbs.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I went to massage
school, went to college.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:10%
But really it was doing
it and finding out

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:10%
that these time-tested
remedies that

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:10%
had been used by millions of
people for thousands of years

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:10%
really work.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:10%
>> And grandma.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:10%
Bringing it home, absolutely.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:10%
So who guided your
practice, specifically,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:10%
while you were
studying herbalism?

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I have had so many
teachers along the way.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's always
been this dedication

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
that while I'm here
on this planet,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to do my best to
make a positive difference.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And if I can help educate people
to learn to eat the dandelions

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and use them as medicine rather
than spraying pesticides,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my job.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So today, we're going
to speak about cravings,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
dependencies,
addictions, et cetera.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
When did you first
notice the need

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
to offer these natural
solutions for these challenges?

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I see that a lot
of people struggle.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think even at a young
age, even with my own family,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
it was going to the
doctors and antibiotics.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And as a teenager,
I suffered from acne

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and went from one
doctor to the next.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was really taking
charge of my own health

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.940 align:middle line:84%
rather than expecting
somebody else

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to fix it that I was
able to clarify things.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's a work in progress.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
This is a subject we can
study our whole lives.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And what a great joy, because
we can not only help ourselves,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
help our health, but do
good for the planet as well.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Because somewhere, there's
going to be fields of lavender

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:90%
and echinacea growing.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.948 align:middle line:84%
>> When you started working with
this and this greater awareness

00:03:25.948 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
to how to approach these things,
what did you start to notice

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:90%
about your clients?

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I know that
there's a lot of people,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:90%
they want to get healthy.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:90%
They want to do it naturally.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But very often
there's some addiction

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:90%
that's standing in the way.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.205 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to say, I want
to get my blood pressure down,

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
or I want to help my
skin be more radiant.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But if we're still addicted
to sugar, coffee, smoking,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that is going to have an effect.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
get in the way of all

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
the herbs, and vitamins,
and health foods

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:90%
that we could possibly eat.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:10%
So I realized early on,
probably even in the '70s,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:10%
that we needed to
look at, perhaps

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:10%
there was something in the
way that was keeping us

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:10%
from having optimal health.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.698 align:middle line:84%
>> So detoxification before
we're trying new remedies is

00:04:12.698 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
essential to really get the
benefit of the new remedies

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to
approach, that we detoxify.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So in that detoxification
approach, what role

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:84%
does pH play, alkalizing the
body, acidifying circumstances?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
What is it that happens there
with acid-alkaline balance?

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's been found that
when we're in a more acid

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
state, which comes from eating
sugar, grains, coffee, alcohol,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to crave
more of those foods.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And the American diet is
more on the acid side.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
If we want to get more
alkaline, it's really simple.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Start eating more
green, leafy vegetables.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I like to remind people
that at least one meal a day

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:90%
should be a salad.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And don't limit green,
leafy vegetables just

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
to leafy things, but
think about broccoli,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:90%
and cucumbers, and arugula.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So the greens are
very alkalinizing.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel
that sugar addiction

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
is at the roots of many
of the other addictions.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
We're a culture that's very
big on stimulating ourselves--

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:84%
a cup of coffee,
sugar, soda, chocolate.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
to sedate ourselves

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:90%
so we can sleep at night.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:10%
So it becomes this
roller coaster ride

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:10%
of stimulate, sedate.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:10%
And so getting more
alkaline is going

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:10%
to not only help
our physical health,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:10%
but also help our
mental well-being

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:10%
so we feel in a more
peaceful and calm state,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:10%
and not craving things so much.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>> What else acidifies the body?

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:84%
What foods in
particular might people

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:84%
be aware of that,
hey, I could opt

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
just not to do that because it's
more acidifying to my system

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:90%
than it's worth?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, grains can be very
acidifying, nuts, meat, dairy.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to say
that those foods can't

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:90%
be in a person's diet.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the diet tends
to be way overly acidic.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you can get
little pH test strips

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and test your urine in
them throughout the day

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:90%
and just see where are you at.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Are you in a state of balance?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's many,
many books written

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:90%
on the importance of this.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we might
even crave a substance

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:90%
that we're allergic to.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:90%
And it could be a food thing.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It could be, but I love
dairy, or I love gluten,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
or I love soy
foods or something.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that we're eating
those foods because we're

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
stimulating an immune response
by activating white blood

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
We actually feel
a little comforted

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
because we've
eaten those things.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that
those grains, for example,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:90%
could be in alcohol.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're craving the
wheat, or the yeast,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:84%
or the sugar that's in
alcoholic beverages.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And back to the sugar
for a minute, the effects

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
of eating sugar, we know that
sugar elevates our blood sugar

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
levels drop, we

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:84%
feel like we need to
redose with sugar.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But the effects
of sugar are very

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:84%
much like the effects of
drinking coffee or doing

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:90%
cocaine, for example.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
We're always playing
with our blood sugar.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> How can someone start
to self-monitor the amount

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:84%
of acidifying foods that
we've named that they do want

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:90%
to consume?

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:84%
How do they know, in
proportion to the amount

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
of alkalizing fruits,
and vegetables,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and these green leafies
that we're talking about--

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
is there a way that
they could just

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:84%
have an eyeshot view of
saying, yes, I'm on track?

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think testing with
pH test strips would be one way.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, I
don't measure or count.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I just really make a concerted
effort to eat more greens,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:84%
eat colorful, fresh
fruits and vegetables,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:90%
to eat lower on the food chain.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But I've heard the
statistics about 80%

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
on the more alkaline range and
maybe 20% on the acid range.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But personally, I'm
just really going

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:84%
to make an effort for
color and not only

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to eat a wide variety
of color, but to eat

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:90%
a wide variety of flavor.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the American
diet seems to be very

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:90%
fixated on sweet and salty.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.489 align:middle line:84%
So I'd also like to
suggest, what about sour?

00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:90%
What about bitter?

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:90%
What about pungent?

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very interesting because
there are research programs

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:45.410 align:middle line:10%
that have shown that covering
a wide variety of flavors curbs

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:10%
cravings in a tremendous way.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually beneficial
to coming off of addiction.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:10%
Do you have any common--

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, a really great thing
is I think a lot of addictive

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:10%
tendencies have their
roots in a liver imbalance.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So the age-old tradition
of starting your day

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
with a cup of warm water and
the juice of half a lemon in it

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.450 align:middle line:84%
is a great way to begin the
day because the sour flavor

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:90%
activates the liver.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:10%
But here in America
we have a saying,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:10%
if life gives you
lemons, get the tequila.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:10%
>> No, just eat the lemons.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And we also know that a
little bit of the bitter flavor

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:90%
can dispel a craving for sweets.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So the few things that we
do have that are bitter,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:84%
maybe chocolate or coffee,
by the time people eat them

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
they tend to have
high fructose corn

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
syrup added to them or
sugar, even dark chocolate,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:90%
which is bitter.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
We want to curb the
sugar in our diets

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
because that's
making us too acidic.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a pH that
one should look for?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they go buy the pH
test strips at their pharmacy

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
or testing in whatever
way they can find,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:90%
the litmus paper to do so.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:10%
Is there a number
they should look for,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:10%
knowing that, OK, I'm
in the right range here

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:10%
that will allow me to
make the changes that I

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:10%
want to make successfully?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:10%
>> It's actually a really small
range between six and seven.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:10%
>> So no matter what they ate
the day before or whatever,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:10%
their urine pH, six or seven
the next day, the next morning,

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:10%
should be an indicator for them
to proceed with success in mind

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:10%
that they can--

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:10%
>> And it is also not unusual
to be a little more acidic

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:10%
in the morning because we
generally are not drinking

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:10%
liquids as much
during the night.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So things might be
more concentrated.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
But again, these tests are
going to change day to day, meal

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to meal.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a barometer.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it
has to be complicated.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:90%
I think it's just good sense.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:10%
>> So if someone is going to
begin a detox program before

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:10%
trying to move into something,
why is that the effective way

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:10%
to approach, let's
say, addiction,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:10%
coming off of addiction?

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
What's the role there
between detox, change,

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle line:84%
dropping out of an
addictive pattern?

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, as long as we are
continuing to do something

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:10%
that's undermining our health,
it's going to be not fruitful

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:10%
to get the results that we want.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we need to do
is really look inside and see,

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
what is it that's
getting in the way?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's going to be
different for different people.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Some people do OK.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to take
that cup of coffee away,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
or they feel that they
don't drink excessively.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's really up
to the individual

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
to say, how is
this affecting me?

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's
some conditions where

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
any consumption of
caffeine or alcohol,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%
certainly if someone's had
a history of alcoholism

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and they're cutting
it out of their life,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:84%
no amount would be
more acceptable.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Sugar, it's hard to avoid that
all together because it's still

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:90%
hidden in so many things.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So it really depends
on the person

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and what is the impediment.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But people not only are
addicted to food substances.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
People can be addicted to
behaviors like Facebook

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:90%
or video games, for example.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So we just want to look at what
these habits might be and maybe

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
really make a contract
with ourselves

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:90%
to say, how is this serving me?

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Is this getting in the way?

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really big
on people journaling.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And so some journal
topics might be,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:84%
what are the reasons
why I want to stop,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:84%
even looking at what
it's costing me.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And we have to keep in mind that
a lot of addictions are legal.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:90%
They're not all illegal things.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's been defined
that an addiction is something

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:84%
that we have to have before
we can get on with our life.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:90%
So to really look at it--

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:90%
what is this costing me?

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Is this affecting my sexuality?

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it affecting sleep?

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Those are always signs
that it's creating

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.010 align:middle line:90%
an imbalance in the body.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But we could look
at an addiction--

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:90%
how is smoking affecting me?

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Am I coughing all the time?

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Is it yellowing my teeth?

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it making me
unpleasant to be around?

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Does my partner say I
smell like an ashtray?

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And then what is the
cost of every cigarette?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And what are those
tax dollars going to?

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And do I want to be
supporting companies

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that are spraying
pesticides and not

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:90%
caring about the environment?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So we really want
to go deep about,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
do I want to be
enslaved by this,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
or do I want to be free of
something that's enslaving me?

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Love myself a
little bit more,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:10%
make different choices that
are self-affirming instead

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:10%
of continuing to escape into
something that's really sucking

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:10%
the life out of me in
one form or another.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
It's so important that
we do this evaluation.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a really
wonderful suggestion

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that you're making, that
someone take the time to start

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
journaling so that we
can see it out in print

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and really take the time to
be present with ourselves

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:90%
in such a way.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:10%
It's a beautiful
component, I think,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:10%
to someone overcoming
addiction, which is just

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:10%
a runaway train of sorts.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:10%
>> And I do believe that
we need rewards in life.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So what are other ways
we can reward ourselves?

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you've
had a hard day.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
You've worked hard.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
For me, I know taking
an aromatherapy bath

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:84%
might be a reward, or calling
a friend long distance,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:84%
or reading a magazine,
or reading a novel,

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:84%
going for a walk, doing
yoga, working in the garden.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And a really big thing for
me is something that's not

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:90%
as prevalent in our culture.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
If we look at our
ancestors, when

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
they got together
socially, they were often

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:90%
doing things with their hands.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.970 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they were
talking, but they

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:10%
might have been woodworking,
or sketching, or knitting,

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:10%
or crocheting, or
doing metal crafting.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would really
like to bring that back

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
because I think a lot of the
energy that goes into always

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
having to be doing something, if
we could be creating something

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
of beauty that improves
our self-esteem,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
that that could also
help to liberate us.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:10%
And I think that there's also
this real powerful magic that

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:10%
happens with this hand
and brain connection

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:10%
when we focus just enough
to say, knit one, purl two.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:10%
And I think that needs to
come back into our culture.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't utilize our
hands and our brain that way,

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I also think that
can make us less

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
likely to have clear mental
faculties as we get older.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.193 align:middle line:90%
It seems so simple.

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:84%
It's actually so
simple, the mind.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:90%
We never think of it.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it has
such a deep value

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
in bringing us back into
our humanity and presence

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to ourself, which is where all
healing comes from ultimately.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:84%
We have to land,
reconnect, and allow

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful,
miraculous system

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:90%
to do what it's built to do.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:10%
But we can't do that if we're
so busy outrunning something

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:10%
that it just stops
everything in its tracks.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk specifics
about detoxing, and starting

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:10%
to get a chemistry, and
shifting the reality

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.418 align:middle line:10%
into a new direction.

00:16:38.418 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:90%
We're coming home to ourselves.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to journal
on some things.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get our hands
in the soil maybe and garden.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.608 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
do these things.

00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're also going
to approach a detox.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Are there specific
herbs that help

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
in the detox of the liver,
which is bearing the brunt of so

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:90%
much of what we're describing?

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of my favorite
herbs is the dandelion.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And actually, dandelion
grows everywhere.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's growing
everywhere for a reason,

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:08.757 align:middle line:90%
saying use me lots.

00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:09.557 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:17:09.557 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's medicine, this
thing's that's irritating

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.371 align:middle line:90%
everyone in their lawn.

00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:90%
They're having to dig it out.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.427 align:middle line:84%
>> And are we are
addicted to pesticides,

00:17:15.427 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%
because that's killing the bees.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
But dandelion leaves
are very alkalinizing.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.609 align:middle line:90%
You can make salad with them.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:84%
The dandelion root in
particular is really

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:90%
good for detoxifying the liver.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:33.073 align:middle line:84%
There's other common herbs--
burdock root, yellow dock root.

00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Those are some of
the herbs I like

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:90%
to use in the detox process.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.577 align:middle line:10%
And they can be made into a tea.

00:17:38.577 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:10%
So it's very simple.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:10%
You could brew up a quart
of tea the night before,

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:10%
let it sit overnight, and
then drink a quart of it

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:10%
the next day.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:10%
You're going to get minerals.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Dandelions are not the enemy.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:90%
They actually aerate the soil.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we really need to
give this plant the accolades

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:90%
that it deserves.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:10%
So this message overall
is relax, exhale,

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.020 align:middle line:10%
utilize your environment,
engage with life again,

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:10%
drop in to nature,
and allow nature

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:10%
to serve you as she's trying to.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
But we're so busy up here in our
heads and living in another way

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've just lost touch
with this overall vibration

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of allowing nature to
nurture in this way.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And you mentioned
exhale, inhale, breathe.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:84%
We can feed our
brains oxygen. And I

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
think very often we're
drawn to, I need something.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I need this.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I need that.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:90%
And a real simple method--

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm a writer.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I've written 14 books.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:10%
And writers are notorious
substance abusers.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And I might sit there at
my desk and say, yeah,

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I really want more yerba
mate, but then I might just--

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:84%
[INHALING] take some deep
inhalations of essential oils.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of shifting
your frequency.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're going down the I'm
freaking out neural pathway,

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and you take some
deep inhalations,

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and it can calm you down.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:84%
This is cardamom,
which I like, which

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.250 align:middle line:84%
is great for coffee
addiction in particular.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But lavender is one
that's so multipurposeful.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So rather than going down,
I'm so tired, I'm so anxious,

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
whatever the emotion might be,
you start smelling something

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:90%
and it affects our hindbrain.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And lavender lane is a lot
nicer than freak out highway.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right with you.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING] Really simple.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.552 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING] That's beautiful.

00:19:31.552 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And I think that carrying
around some essential oils is

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:10%
a great way of
shifting consciousness.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And because there's
often such a connection

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
between a craving for
sweets, whether it

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:84%
be we want coffee or chocolate,
smelling some naturally sweet

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.760 align:middle line:84%
essential oils like
fennel or anise

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
can give our brains a sensation
of, I'm having something sweet,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:90%
without imbibing any calories.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:10%
We know that we
are energy beings,

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:10%
that everything is energy.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we bring
the consciousness

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:84%
of these vibrations
of fennel or what

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:84%
we might choose instead of
reaching for the actual sweet,

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:84%
it impacts us on this
energy body level,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:90%
on the subtle level.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And the impact is there
without shoving something

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:84%
in our mouth to try to create
a chemical on a physical level.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
We can preempt it is basically
what you're saying, yes?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And even deep breathing,
things that get us to breathe--

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
yoga, qigong, tai
chi, meditation--

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one
of the principles

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
of many different practices
that calm our mind and body.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Definitely a big
part of my life.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:10%
And I could not
live the life that I

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:10%
live if I wasn't implementing
these kinds of practices.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So I so appreciate that
you're out there in the world,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:90%
teaching people how to do this.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I want to come right
back into detoxing

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.250 align:middle line:84%
because I know that it's
a big word for people.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:84%
People are trying to detox, and
they're trying to do it safely,

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:84%
or they're trying to figure
out what's effective.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:84%
In regarding herbalism, what
creates an effective detoxing

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:90%
agent?

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:10%
What's the criteria
there that you would say,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.007 align:middle line:10%
well, it's got to do this,
or it's got to have this,

00:21:12.007 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:10%
or it's got to access
this aspect of our system?

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there's
so many detoxes,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:10%
and there's so many products
you can buy that are ready-made

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:10%
that can be helpful.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
that a lot of them

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
are going to have some
laxative herbs in there.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if you eliminate
through the colon,

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:90%
that's one method of detoxing.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:10%
So they might have herbs in them
like flaxseed or psyllium seed.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:10%
Many of them are
going to have herbs

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:10%
that help to cleanse the
kidneys by being diuretic.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So you might find herbs like
dandelion leaf or nettle.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:10%
You might find herbs that
are going to be diaphoretic,

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:10%
that maybe make
you sweat as well,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:10%
could be something like
peppermint or yarrow.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:10%
So you can drink
these herbs as teas.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
available in capsules.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.428 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, you would
want to drink a lot more water.

00:22:07.428 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But we also should
be thinking about,

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
are we drinking pure
water, spring water,

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
distilled water, water
that's hopefully not

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:90%
in plastic bottles?

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
We really want to do what we can
to improve the quality of water

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:90%
that we're drinking.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:10%
And then Epsom salt baths
can be a wonderful thing

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:10%
to do during a detox.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:10%
If you live somewhere where
you have access to a sauna

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:10%
or you can go to
hot springs, that

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:10%
can be part of
the detox process.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.850 align:middle line:10%
A dry brush skin massaging
is a great method

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:10%
of helping to loosen
dead skin cells

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:10%
and improve lymphatic flow.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
This might also be a time
that you want to get massage.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But I also think we need to
do it body, mind, and spirit.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So making a resolution
of, why do I want to quit?

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
What am I willing
to do about it?

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we need to
give ourselves a little time,

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:84%
like, I want to be
done by this addiction

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:90%
perhaps 30 days from now.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:10%
It might not happen
tomorrow, but we're

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:10%
in the process of doing
less, and less, and less.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:10%
So that by whatever it is,
the first day of summer,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:10%
or the first day of the
new year, or whatever,

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:10%
that we're on a better track.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:10%
And then maybe we get rid of
the paraphernalia associated

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:10%
with it.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ascribe to building
up the system in these positive

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
ways of alkalizing the system,
et cetera before we even

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.640 align:middle line:84%
attempt to try to take away the
things that we're addicted to?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Is that, in your experience,
more helpful for people?

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that a lot of
people, they want relief now.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that
we have to separate it,

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:84%
that you could be
getting more alkaline,

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and detoxing, and
cleaning your house.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm a multitasker or
maybe because I'm a bit older.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.437 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot to do here.

00:23:55.437 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And I want to help people.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.583 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I have their attention
while they're reading the book

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:90%
or they're a client of mine.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to try to make
it as simple as possible

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and cheer people on,
like, you can do this.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And all right, how different
can your life be in a month?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that herbalism is
this idea that we're reaching

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:84%
into nature, and we're
connecting with nature.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:10%
We're consuming nature and
its medicinal properties

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:10%
as an attempt to
be more holistic,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:10%
to open up again and not be
so isolated as a separate self

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.580 align:middle line:10%
that's having to survive,
but that we allow

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:10%
really nature to be on our side,
and that we belong in that way.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
concepts in this is

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:84%
the idea of adaptogens and
things that bring harmony.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:10%
Can you speak about
what that is and how

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:10%
it plays a role in what
you're doing with people?

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the word "adaptogen"
indicates that there's a whole

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:10%
classification of plants--

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:10%
and we could even say foods--

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:10%
that help our bodies
acclimate to stress.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:10%
So one of the beautiful
things about adaptogens

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.470 align:middle line:10%
is they can give you more
energy if you need more energy,

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:10%
but they can also help calm you
down if that's what you need.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.560 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the
adaptogenic herbs,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:10%
I think of things like
eleuthero, which used

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:10%
to be called Siberian ginseng.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I think of ashwagandha,
of schisandra berries.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:90%
I think of rhodiola.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:10%
A lot of these herbs grow under
very difficult conditions,

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:10%
that the plants
themselves have had

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:10%
to adapt to adversity,
like growing in Siberia

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:10%
or growing on a cliff in
Iceland with the waves smashing

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:10%
against--

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:10%
like rhodiola that
I've collected there.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:10%
And I think that when we
imbibe these plants that

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:10%
have to adapt, that it's
going to help us acclimate.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:10%
But I also think that the
dandelion is an adaptogen

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:10%
because they try so many
ways to eradicate it,

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:10%
and it still comes back.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.173 align:middle line:90%
>> You're not getting rid of me.

00:26:03.173 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a lot of qi in there.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that I love about--

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:84%
when I make a salad, I'm
often harvesting those plants

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
five minutes before
we're consuming them

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:90%
at the dinner table.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of energy
you get from those plants,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:90%
it's unsurpassed.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You can't buy that at the
store when the kale was picked

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:90%
six weeks ago in another state.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The enzymatic activity,
the vital force is there.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.042 align:middle line:90%
>> You're consuming that.

00:26:29.042 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:10%
It's becoming part of your
system because of this, yes?

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Beautiful.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So what then is the
relationship between adaptogens

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:90%
and addiction?

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.610 align:middle line:10%
How does it directly benefit
our attempt to change?

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, a lot of the adaptogens
have a special affinity

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:10%
for nourishing the
adrenal glands.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So if we have long been using
some substance, whether it

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:84%
be coffee, or alcohol, or sugar,
and cocaine on, and on, and on,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
our adrenal glands
get very exhausted.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think
a lot of people

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:84%
have exhausted adrenal
glands anyways.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But we know that these
adaptogens nourish our energy

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:90%
They support us.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:10%
And they might give us
more energy during the day,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:10%
but they could also help us
to have better sleep at night

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:10%
and stay asleep.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:10%
And so when we start our day
with a cup of coffee, which

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:10%
is totally legal
and all American,

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:10%
you're actually stimulating
adrenaline production.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:10%
And adrenaline is that
flight or fight hormone

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.440 align:middle line:10%
that we're supposed to
be producing when we're

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:10%
in an emergency situation,
when the baby's trapped

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.307 align:middle line:10%
under the car.

00:27:40.307 --> 00:27:42.390 align:middle line:10%
And yet, we start our days
like that all the time.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.705 align:middle line:10%
>> Every day, baby under the
car every day before 9 o'clock.

00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And it might not
get any better when

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:84%
we start loading sugar
and soft drinks onto that.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:10%
>> So then we reach for
things because it's exhausting

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.010 align:middle line:10%
to our system to constantly
be in this fight or flight.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Then we reach for things that
are a false sense of energy.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:10%
And sugar has been one
of our favorite flavors

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:10%
of that process.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:90%
As we know, art imitates life.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's a film Brigitte
has mentioned in her class that

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:84%
poignantly illustrates the
relationship between addiction

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:90%
and blood sugar levels.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a 1955
film, "Man With a Golden Arm."

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the most
gorgeous day I ever saw.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
first day I ever saw.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.590 align:middle line:10%
I got a craving for
something sweet.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:10%
You got anything sweet?

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Sugar?

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.312 align:middle line:10%
>> Give me.

00:28:39.312 --> 00:28:45.734 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.734 --> 00:28:46.722 align:middle line:10%
More.

00:28:46.722 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.168 align:middle line:90%


00:28:51.168 --> 00:28:53.032 align:middle line:10%
>> Ooh, how can you?

00:28:53.032 --> 00:28:55.192 align:middle line:10%
Oh, Frankie.

00:28:55.192 --> 00:28:57.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, I never felt
as good in my life.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.962 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.962 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHING] What
are we seeing here?

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:10%
>> We're seeing the people go
from one addiction to the next.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you've ever
been to an AA meeting,

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.980 align:middle line:84%
very often people
get off alcohol,

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and then it's totally accepted
to drink lots of coffee

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:90%
and even smoke cigarettes.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Even when people go
to rehab, they often

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:90%
come away with other addictions.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And there might be a whole
potluck of lots of sugary foods

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:90%
to eat too.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So as long as we stay
in the sugar loop,

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.970 align:middle line:84%
we might be going from
one addiction to the next.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> My son-in-law likes to call
sugar legal drugs for kids.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, great.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Get them off to a fast,
early start, yeah.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.650 align:middle line:10%
So what is specifically
that relationship

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:10%
between blood sugar
levels and addiction?

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think we have to
start looking at that sugar

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.730 align:middle line:84%
itself has become a drug,
because sugar is in the same

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:90%
family as wheat, barley.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.060 align:middle line:84%
It's in the grass family,
corn, unless we're

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:90%
getting sugar beets.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, wherever
the sugar comes from,

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:90%
it is refined.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:10%
We take this mineral
rich substance,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.190 align:middle line:10%
for example, sugar
cane, we remove

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.480 align:middle line:10%
all the nutrients from it, which
is where the molasses comes in.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Molasses is full of
B vitamins and iron.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:10%
And then what we're left with
is a white, crystalline powder.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So we are turning
a food that could

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:90%
be nourishing into a drug.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And salt, the other predominant
flavor in our culture,

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:84%
most salt is heated to
about 1,400 degrees,

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:84%
the minerals removed
from it, and then

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:90%
sold to the vitamin companies.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So our salt and our
sugar have become

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.970 align:middle line:84%
like drugs that don't
ever really satisfy us.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:53.600 align:middle line:10%
So it would be wiser to get
the sweet flavor, which,

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:10%
of course, is our birthright
because mother's milk is sweet,

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:01.160 align:middle line:10%
but to look to eating
things that are nurturing,

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:10%
that are what they call in
Asian medicine full sweet,

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:10%
so things like sweet potatoes,
or winter squash, or pumpkin,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:10%
or parsnips.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting
the sweet flavor,

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:84%
but you're also getting
fiber, and minerals,

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.837 align:middle line:84%
and beta carotene, and
all that good stuff too.

00:31:16.837 --> 00:31:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>> From a whole, complete food--

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> --rather than just a partial,
empty version of it that is

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.450 align:middle line:90%
stimulatory to the body.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Because when we
refine a substance,

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.530 align:middle line:84%
it has more potential
for addiction.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So after the Civil War, there
were thousands of Americans

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.825 align:middle line:90%
that were addicted to morphine.

00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:90%


00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But then heroin was
invented to be a remedy

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.343 align:middle line:90%
for morphine addiction.

00:31:40.343 --> 00:31:42.260 align:middle line:10%
And that turned out to
be even more addicting.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:10%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And the morphine
was derived from opium.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So opium is addicting, but
morphine is more addicting.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So the more you
refine a substance--

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:84%
we could say the same
things about coca leaves.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Coca leaves are chewed by
people of South America.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, the Indians.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:10%
It helps with altitude--

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:10%
>> --sickness and hunger.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you refine it into
a crystalline white powder,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
addiction sets in

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
anything to balance it.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no chlorophyll, or
vitamins, or protein in it

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.108 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

00:32:13.108 --> 00:32:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So the system is
reeling out of control,

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:84%
trying to find some
kind of balance,

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and then becomes addictive
in attempt to satiate that.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.535 align:middle line:10%
>> And you can't patent a plant.

00:32:24.535 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:10%
So there's always
been this thing

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:10%
about, well, let's refine it.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:10%
Let's make it simpler.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.470 align:middle line:10%
And so when you make
something even easier to use,

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:38.960 align:middle line:10%
because it's ready to go,
it becomes easier to abuse.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot easier to drink a
little bit of vodka than drink

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.670 align:middle line:84%
three beers because
it's more concentrated.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHING] Get
the same effect.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The hypodermic needle, the
first recorded drug addict,

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.130 align:middle line:84%
needle user was the
wife of the man,

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.290 align:middle line:84%
the doctor who had invented
the hypodermic needle.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.000 align:middle line:90%
She was a morphine addict.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So the more easy we make
it-- pre-rolled cigarettes

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
are a lot easier to overuse than
when you have to roll your own

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and go sit outside
on the snowy porch,

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:90%
and it goes out 10 times.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:10%
So pre-rolled cigarettes
that have chemicals

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.570 align:middle line:10%
added to make them continue to
be lit rather than going out,

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.570 align:middle line:10%
it's a lot easier to abuse that.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's come back to your
herbs for just a moment--

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.140 align:middle line:10%
specific herbs to help
regulate blood sugar?

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think of
fennel and anise,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.280 align:middle line:10%
but cinnamon is
one of my favorite.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Cinnamon is naturally sweet.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It is an herb that
improves circulation.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasant herb.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So for example, even instead
of adding honey or maple

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.820 align:middle line:84%
syrup to some applesauce
that you're making,

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.440 align:middle line:90%
you could add cinnamon to it.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.030 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
cinnamon is one

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.090 align:middle line:84%
of the premier herbs
for people with diabetes

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:84%
because it stabilizes
blood sugar.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a flavor that
most people like, safe.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.580 align:middle line:90%
You can smell it.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.690 align:middle line:90%
You can eat it.

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.400 align:middle line:90%
You can drink it as a tea.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.179 align:middle line:84%
And I even brought with me
a little cinnamon stick.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.820 align:middle line:10%
Because if someone were trying
to quit smoking cigarettes,

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.480 align:middle line:10%
they might inhale
through a cinnamon stick.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a way
to inhale deeply,

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.170 align:middle line:90%
gives you something to hold.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:10%
>> And is addressing it from
the energetic perspective all

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:90%
So what about cravings?

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Is there a specific
herb that helps

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:84%
people just stop the craving,
preempting this whole cycle?

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think that
depending on the addiction,

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:10%
different foods and
different herbs might help.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:10%
So for example, a
craving for tobacco--

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:55.460 align:middle line:10%
it might be helpful to use an
herb that has similar chemical

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:10%
makeup, like the herb lobelia
has an alkaloid in it called

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:10%
lobeline, which can
satisfy the receptor sites

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:10%
and yet not be addicting.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:84%
It is an herb to use
in very small amounts

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.762 align:middle line:84%
because too much of it can have
an emetic quality to it, where

00:35:09.762 --> 00:35:10.970 align:middle line:90%
it can make someone throw up.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's very small
amounts, about a third

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.400 align:middle line:84%
of the strength you
would use other herbs.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone
really likes coffee.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:84%
It's so prevalent
and so accepted.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But yet, maybe you need
something to get you going.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:10%
It may be that you find
yerba mate is kinder

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:10%
to your adrenals
or green tea, which

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:10%
has all kinds of anti-cancer
compounds, polyphenols.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But the sugar
craving thing, there

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:84%
is an herb called
gymnema sylvestre,

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's an herb that
actually blocks our ability

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.430 align:middle line:90%
to taste the sweet flavor.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So that is an herb that can help
people that really think they

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.210 align:middle line:90%
need to eat a lot of sweets.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if we could
use more cinnamon,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.460 align:middle line:90%
we could smell fennel or anise.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And then another thing,
as we mentioned earlier,

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:middle line:84%
smelling essential
oils that help

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:84%
to hit some of
those same receptor

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:84%
sites can also help us to let
go of a habitual behavior.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:90%
So let's just recap here.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, if we
could just lay it out,

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:84%
what role do herbs play
in overcoming addiction?

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Just boom.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, herbs can help so much
because we have herbs that can

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:33.590 align:middle line:84%
stabilize blood sugar, like
fennel, anise, cinnamon.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.340 align:middle line:84%
We have herbs that can help
in the detoxification process.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the sooner we can get
these substances that we don't

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.723 align:middle line:84%
want any longer
out of our bodies,

00:36:42.723 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:84%
the sooner we're
going to be free.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have allies like
dandelion, yellow dock, burdock

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.010 align:middle line:90%
root.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:84%
We have herbs that can give us
a little bit of energy, that

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.570 align:middle line:84%
maybe still have some
stimulant in them

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:00.020 align:middle line:90%
like green tea or yerba mate.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:10%
And we also have herbs
that are adaptogens

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:10%
that are going to
nourish our adrenals

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:10%
and strengthen our willpower,
things like rhodiola,

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.750 align:middle line:10%
holy basil, schisandra
berries, and eleuthero.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell us about
the kudzu vine, and alcohol,

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.260 align:middle line:10%
and that relationship there?

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, kudzu is an herb that
has a long history of being

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
used in Chinese medicine as
a remedy for drunkenness.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And there was actually a study--

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not big on animal
studies, I want to say.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:84%
For me, the herbs
have been tested

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
by humans for long
enough, but there

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.010 align:middle line:84%
was a study done
with hamsters that

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:90%
were bred to be alcoholics.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were
offered three tubes--

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.920 align:middle line:84%
a tube of water, a tube of kudzu
flower tea, and then a tube

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.240 align:middle line:90%
of alcohol.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And when the kudzu
was available to them,

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:84%
the amount of alcohol
consumption decreased by 50%.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's not a total
giving up drinking,

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:84%
but for a lot of people
drinking half as much

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:90%
would probably be better.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.610 align:middle line:10%
So let's say someone's
drinking, and they're

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:10%
doing it for
self-medicating purposes,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.660 align:middle line:10%
for its calming effect.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:14.773 align:middle line:84%
What are specific herbal
alternatives to just completing

00:38:14.773 --> 00:38:15.690 align:middle line:90%
this cycle for people?

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I just really want
our viewers to know

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm stuck in this
cycle, I'm drinking too much,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and I know it, or I
kind of don't know it,

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.140 align:middle line:84%
but now that they're
talking, maybe I am.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And I can't imagine not,
because at the end of the day

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I want something to just bring
me back into my body basically

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.273 align:middle line:90%
or calm me down.

00:38:37.273 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:84%
What could they
reach for instead?

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there are so many
herbs too that can nourish

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.510 align:middle line:10%
the nervous system and help
us to sleep and mellow out.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think of the herb
valerian, which is not

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:90%
what Valium is made from.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.430 align:middle line:90%
That's actually a myth.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Another herb that I
like is kava kava.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.958 align:middle line:84%
However, valerian doesn't
work for everybody.

00:38:57.958 --> 00:38:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Some people, it makes
them more stimulated.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But most people find that
it helps them to sleep,

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.160 align:middle line:90%
and unwind, and relax.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Kava kava had some negative
press a few years ago

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:84%
because a European
company was extracting

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:14.600 align:middle line:84%
the kavalactones in
there with chemicals

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:90%
like hexane and benzene.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But kava kava is an
herb that is used

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:84%
in ceremony and celebration in
many of the tropical regions

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.420 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:10%
It does make you feel
uber relaxed to the point

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.982 align:middle line:10%
that you should not operate
heavy machinery or drive--

00:39:29.982 --> 00:39:30.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.360 align:middle line:10%
>> --the first few
times you use it.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.650 align:middle line:10%
But kava kava's widely
used in Europe for anxiety.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:90%
And I enjoy it.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a nice, celebratory thing
to drink with my friends,

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and sure is a good night's
sleep, and also very vivid

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.900 align:middle line:90%
dreams as well.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So it should be handled like
as if someone was drinking

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.780 align:middle line:84%
an alcoholic beverage
or something that

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.300 align:middle line:90%
is likely to alter them.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So they should approach
this with awareness.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it has a calming
effect, is healthier for you

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:90%
by all means.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.690 align:middle line:90%
And tell us about the dreams.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:11.010 align:middle line:90%
What happens there?

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:14.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, dreams can be a way of
processing psychological stuff.

00:40:14.395 --> 00:40:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, personally, I will
share that I sleep with

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:84%
a little sachet of rosemary and
another herb called artemisia.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And smell can really
affect our mental state.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you may find yourself
having very vivid dreams

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and even be able to remember
them better, because we

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:40.830 align:middle line:90%
underuse this faculty of smell.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But I did want to say, for
people who want milder sedative

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.340 align:middle line:84%
herbs, we have things
like chamomile,

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.860 align:middle line:90%
and passionflower, and skullcap.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.912 align:middle line:10%
So you don't need to
reinvent the wheel.

00:40:51.912 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:10%
You can go to the
health food store

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.500 align:middle line:10%
and find somebody
knowledgeable who

00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:10%
can say, this is available in
teas, or tincture, or capsules.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.320 align:middle line:10%
Of course, if someone is
trying to give up alcohol,

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.230 align:middle line:10%
they should not use
alcohol tinctures.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:10%
But you can find many
of them in capsules

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.240 align:middle line:10%
or in a liquid glycerin.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.540 align:middle line:10%
So there are alternatives.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.390 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
also herbs that have

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.080 align:middle line:10%
a history of being used to
help people get off alcohol.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.450 align:middle line:10%
Angelica is one of them.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> High frequency
energy in angelica.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And lifts us up where
alcohol is a suppressant,

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.770 align:middle line:84%
so it can pull us up to a
higher vibrational frequency.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:35.820 align:middle line:10%
I have a great
interest in everything

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.530 align:middle line:10%
energetic and what
it is that we can

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:10%
do to raise our
vibrational frequency

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.602 align:middle line:10%
and integrate our energies.

00:41:42.602 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:10%
And everything that
you're speaking about

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.760 align:middle line:10%
is exactly that, by approaching
it from a holistic standpoint,

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.930 align:middle line:10%
allowing the earth to provide
grounding qualities for us

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.350 align:middle line:10%
to integrate and to heal.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk
about a plant that

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.010 align:middle line:84%
has been getting a
lot of press recently,

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:84%
a natural analgesic related
to the coffee plant.

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:06.120 align:middle line:84%
In 2017, the US Department
of Health and Human Services

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.490 align:middle line:84%
declared a public
health emergency

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:11.640 align:middle line:84%
to address a national
opioid crisis.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Millions of Americans
misuse prescription

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:84%
opioids, and millions
of others are

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:84%
dependent on these medications
because of chronic pain.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Many have turned to a
natural alternative,

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.750 align:middle line:84%
a plant called
kratom or "kra-tom."

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:27.420 align:middle line:84%
For some Americans,
this is a miracle herb.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But for the FDA, kratom is just
another addictive substance.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.580 align:middle line:84%
The film, "A Leaf of
Faith," poses the question,

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:84%
can a plant offer safe,
effective, and organic pain

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:90%
relief compared to opioids?

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this documentary.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.852 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:42:44.852 --> 00:42:47.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Before I had the stroke, I
was doing about 90 pain pills

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.870 align:middle line:10%
a day for seven years.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:52.415 align:middle line:10%
>> Had about 15 years of my
life go by in a blur of opiates.

00:42:52.415 --> 00:42:54.540 align:middle line:10%
>> You could roll me up,
stick me in a garbage bag,

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.820 align:middle line:10%
and put me out at the curb, and
that was about all I was good

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.620 align:middle line:10%
for.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Do I think pharma
made mistakes?

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.240 align:middle line:10%
Oh, yes, I do.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.700 align:middle line:10%
But we also know there's
more heroin on the streets

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.840 align:middle line:10%
than ever before.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.830 align:middle line:10%
Afghanistan and the opium
runs poisoned Americans.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:10%
>> What if I told you I had
the cure for the opioid crisis

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.060 align:middle line:10%
in my hand?

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.320 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not new.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.130 align:middle line:10%
It's not synthetic.

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Kratom represents a great
starting point for developing

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.900 align:middle line:10%
new, safer pain relievers.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a plant that helps
people overcome opiate

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.500 align:middle line:90%
addiction.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.793 align:middle line:90%
>> We are kratom.

00:43:23.793 --> 00:43:25.086 align:middle line:90%
>> We are kratom.

00:43:25.086 --> 00:43:26.953 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you guys
hope comes out of this?

00:43:26.953 --> 00:43:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That I get to keep
kratom in my life,

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.970 align:middle line:90%
because it saved my life.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just tired of pain.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Brigitte, you've
seen this documentary.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.850 align:middle line:84%
What is your take on this from
an herbalist's perspective?

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not only have
I seen the documentary,

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:84%
but I've also spoken to a number
of people who are finding that

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:84%
kratom is an
alternative to them.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Many people did not start out
wanting to become addicted.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.990 align:middle line:84%
They were given prescriptions
for pain pills because

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:56.760 align:middle line:90%
of an accident or injury.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And their bodies got
very dependent on it.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And yes, the opioid
crisis is very real.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
people are dying every day,

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.460 align:middle line:90%
but it is an epidemic.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that kratom
is the answer to everything.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.580 align:middle line:10%
I think that we need to do
what we can to relieve pain,

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.030 align:middle line:10%
whether it be through
chiropractic or osteopathic

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:25.830 align:middle line:10%
work, yoga, Rohlfing,
massage, eating

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.230 align:middle line:10%
an anti-inflammatory diet.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that
we need to relieve pain.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it's
going to take relieving

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.950 align:middle line:10%
that pain for a
person to even be

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.620 align:middle line:10%
able to get motivated
to go to a class

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:10%
or find a health professional
they can work with.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.170 align:middle line:10%
So kratom is an herb.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.960 align:middle line:84%
It is helping a lot of
people to relieve pain,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:90%
to relieve inflammation.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that some people
are going to get relief from it.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.350 align:middle line:84%
They are telling me that
it's working for them.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I've tried it a few times.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.610 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be very relaxing.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:07.230 align:middle line:10%
And I think that it needs to
be available for people that

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:08.970 align:middle line:10%
are going to be helped by this.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.310 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't grow in this
country, at least not yet.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:13.140 align:middle line:10%
It grows in the tropics.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.330 align:middle line:10%
And there's different
qualities of it.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.760 align:middle line:90%
But we need to address this.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And taking another
pharmaceutical

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.520 align:middle line:90%
isn't going to be the answer.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is an attempt to
stop the runaway train while

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:32.100 align:middle line:84%
we're figuring out how to
ground ourselves enough to begin

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.210 align:middle line:84%
a process of rehabilitation
on every level that caused

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.330 align:middle line:84%
the addictions in
the first place.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.270 align:middle line:84%
What pros and cons
exist with this plant?

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there have been
a few deaths or overdoses.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.060 align:middle line:84%
However, there's a lot of deaths
and overdoses from opiates.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think if people have good
intentions and are not using,

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.540 align:middle line:90%
and they're using this instead--

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.690 align:middle line:84%
but who's to say when
people are on dozens

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.450 align:middle line:90%
of prescription drugs.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to stay
on this planet forever.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So if it gives
people an opportunity

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.230 align:middle line:84%
to take charge of their health
and find ways of getting

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.900 align:middle line:90%
some relief, absolutely.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we should
have access to all plants.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.170 align:middle line:90%
All of them have some virtue.

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Even poison ivy is
used in homeopathy.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So it takes understanding,
and knowledge, and research.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's
herbalists on the planet,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.270 align:middle line:84%
to help people
figure it all out.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you suppose it poses a
threat to the pharmaceutical

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.960 align:middle line:90%
industry, being a natural plant?

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to go
back to the year 1900,

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.950 align:middle line:84%
most pharmaceuticals
were made from plants.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And as more and more
products became synthesized

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.700 align:middle line:84%
or we extracted
what was believed

00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.060 align:middle line:84%
to be the active
ingredient, we started

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.230 align:middle line:90%
developing all of these drugs.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.650 align:middle line:84%
But we're also finding
out that a lot of drugs

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:07.560 align:middle line:84%
have side effects and that
maybe we were better off

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.420 align:middle line:90%
using the whole plant.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:14.480 align:middle line:10%
Again, the dandelion
is as diuretic-- is

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:19.110 align:middle line:10%
as effective as one of the
leading diuretic drugs.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And diuretics deplete
the body of potassium,

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.990 align:middle line:84%
but dandelions
give you potassium.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But who's going to do millions
of dollars of research

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.880 align:middle line:84%
on something that's a weed
in people's backyards?

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so obvious.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.783 align:middle line:90%
It's right under our nose.

00:47:33.783 --> 00:47:38.130 align:middle line:10%
And we miss it because we're in
our heads, too sophisticated,

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:42.430 align:middle line:10%
having a better idea than what
nature had to provide us, yeah.

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So you write in your book about
these potentially addictive

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:50.910 align:middle line:84%
substances that get set
into motion in our lives

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:55.770 align:middle line:84%
that originally were only
used for ceremonial purposes.

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:59.040 align:middle line:10%
Can you speak to the
difference in usage

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.830 align:middle line:10%
that way versus what has
happened in our culture that

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:04.740 align:middle line:10%
is possibly leading
to an overuse

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.650 align:middle line:10%
or an addictive
perspective on them?

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we often think,
well, tobacco has been smoked

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:14.760 align:middle line:90%
by the Native Americans.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Or we could say that alcohol
is a natural substance.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these
substances, originally they

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.010 align:middle line:84%
were used on occasion,
and as you said,

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.080 align:middle line:90%
for ceremony, for celebration.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a big difference
between a toast to life

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:36.000 align:middle line:84%
or in celebration than
polishing off a bottle of vodka

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:36.960 align:middle line:90%
by yourself.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.060 align:middle line:10%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:38.860 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Ceremony of another sort.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
fine line sometimes.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Are we celebrating
every day, all day long?

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it undermining our health?

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But many of these things
were used on occasion

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.460 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate a reunion, a
gathering, a birth, a baptism,

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:03.130 align:middle line:90%
a job celebration.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
started becoming used

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:07.290 align:middle line:90%
without any intention--

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.390 align:middle line:84%
so I really like
the idea of whatever

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:13.410 align:middle line:84%
it is you're going to
use, to have an intention.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:14.897 align:middle line:84%
Is this the right
time to use it?

00:49:14.897 --> 00:49:16.480 align:middle line:10%
Just because a
substance is available,

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.220 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't mean
it's the right time.

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.950 align:middle line:10%
But I do see that we've gone--

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:27.750 align:middle line:10%
even coffee originally was used
to stay up all night and pray

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:33.960 align:middle line:10%
by some of the early
mullahs in the Arab culture.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.270 align:middle line:10%
>> It certainly has taken on a
different route in our culture

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:40.440 align:middle line:10%
now, as has tobacco.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So cigarette addiction
is a worldwide issue--

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.100 align:middle line:84%
specific herbs to help
with nicotine addiction?

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:52.060 align:middle line:10%
>> So I used to be a smoker.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.910 align:middle line:10%
Deep breathing
exercises, we talked

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.100 align:middle line:10%
about inhaling through
a cinnamon stick,

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.680 align:middle line:10%
but also chewing
on licorice roots.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.470 align:middle line:10%
Eating sunflower
seeds in the shell

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:10%
gives you something to do
with your hands and mouth.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.140 align:middle line:90%
That's another good one.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.390 align:middle line:10%
One of the specific
essential oils to smell

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:13.060 align:middle line:10%
is black pepper
because it smells

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.950 align:middle line:10%
the most like an ashtray.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:17.620 align:middle line:10%
And so rather than having
a cigarette, you just--

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.830 align:middle line:10%
[INHALING] take some
deep inhalations.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.140 align:middle line:10%
But again, making a
list of all the reasons

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.980 align:middle line:10%
why you want to quit
might be helpful.

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.380 align:middle line:10%
I did mention lobelia.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:33.340 align:middle line:10%
Chewing five juniper berries
a day is another folk remedy

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.660 align:middle line:10%
to break up the deposits of
tar and nicotine in our lungs

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.230 align:middle line:10%
and doing a few saunas when
you get to the point like, OK,

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:42.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm giving it up.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.280 align:middle line:10%
You want to do things to help
break up that congestion.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>> How does this lobelia
work, regarding the nicotine?

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it has an alkaloid
in it called lobeline,

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:57.610 align:middle line:84%
which is very similar to
the structure of nicotine.

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:01.210 align:middle line:10%
And so when lobeline is--
or lobelia, the whole herb,

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.580 align:middle line:10%
is ingested, the body
feels like, well, I'm

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.040 align:middle line:10%
getting that fix.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.630 align:middle line:10%
But yet, the lobelia
is not habit forming

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.960 align:middle line:10%
using just such a small amount.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I also want to say that people
smoked throughout history

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.540 align:middle line:90%
many, many different plants.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:20.290 align:middle line:10%
Somehow we latched
on to tobacco,

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:24.310 align:middle line:10%
but people have smoked mint,
and rose petals, and damiana,

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:25.300 align:middle line:10%
and mullein.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.550 align:middle line:10%
Mullein actually used
to be recommended.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.490 align:middle line:10%
>> And cloves.

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, cloves.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.027 align:middle line:10%
Most of the world's
production of cloves

00:51:30.027 --> 00:51:32.260 align:middle line:10%
goes into clove
cigarettes, which

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:10%
might not be such a
good idea because they

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.860 align:middle line:10%
are somewhat anesthetic.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.400 align:middle line:10%
So you tend to
inhale more deeply.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.740 align:middle line:90%
But there's been many herbs.

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Mullein used to be recommended
for asthma patients

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.792 align:middle line:84%
as a bronchial dilator and
an anti-inflammatory agent.

00:51:48.792 --> 00:51:50.500 align:middle line:10%
Again, I'm not trying
to encourage people

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:55.370 align:middle line:10%
to start smoking things, but
we made them more concentrated,

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:56.170 align:middle line:10%
more addicting.

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.990 align:middle line:84%
We increased the
content of nicotine

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.940 align:middle line:90%
that was in there originally.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:01.890 align:middle line:90%
We boosted that.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.810 align:middle line:10%
I really appreciate
what you're saying

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:08.410 align:middle line:10%
about the more concentrated
it becomes, the more likely

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:11.050 align:middle line:10%
it is to be an addictive
substance because it

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:12.400 align:middle line:10%
becomes more stimulatory.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.010 align:middle line:10%
And we're trying to
back it out and use

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:18.490 align:middle line:10%
the whole plant, the whole food,
so that the system can remain

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:22.930 align:middle line:10%
harmonious and can even utilize
it as an adaptogen kind of way,

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.480 align:middle line:10%
taking from it what it needs
and discarding the rest,

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.820 align:middle line:10%
but not having to overstimulate.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about nutritional
therapy for anxiety?

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, anxiety seems
very prevalent right now.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.290 align:middle line:10%
And it's been found that
when people have low blood

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:41.380 align:middle line:10%
sugar, where maybe
they've skipped meals

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:44.620 align:middle line:10%
or they just had something sweet
or stimulating for breakfast

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.950 align:middle line:10%
and lunch, low blood
sugar might make one more

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:51.190 align:middle line:10%
prone to having a panic attack.

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:54.250 align:middle line:10%
We also know that
when we feel anxious,

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.340 align:middle line:10%
we might be breathing
very shallowly or rapidly.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.160 align:middle line:10%
So really quick
thing to do, just

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:05.080 align:middle line:10%
start taking some deep
inhalations of lavender.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Have some snacks with you.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:08.830 align:middle line:84%
I like to travel
with some Brazil nuts

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:12.520 align:middle line:84%
because they're high in
protein and good quality fats.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And just eating three or four
of them can be very grounding.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes having
some snacks with you

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.490 align:middle line:84%
can keep you from
making a poor decision

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and buying something
from a vending machine

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:25.270 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to help you.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:27.080 align:middle line:10%
There's also a wonderful
little substance

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.190 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you and
many of our viewers

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:33.280 align:middle line:10%
are familiar with called Rescue
Remedy, one of the Bach flower

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.380 align:middle line:10%
remedies, which is like a
little miracle in a bottle.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.880 align:middle line:84%
You take two drops under your
tongue, and all of a sudden you

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.480 align:middle line:84%
just feel calmer and better
able to deal with the situation.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
sugar and caffeine

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:48.100 align:middle line:90%
are the enemies of addiction.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.310 align:middle line:84%
They tend to promote
those feelings.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But I even think things like
music that's overly fast--

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.610 align:middle line:84%
when the music is
really fast, it

00:53:57.610 --> 00:54:00.550 align:middle line:84%
can overtake our
physiological functions

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:02.140 align:middle line:90%
and make our hearts beat faster.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So anything we can do
to feel more grounded--

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:08.050 align:middle line:84%
the sound of running
water, like having

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:12.010 align:middle line:84%
a waterfall in your
space, or maybe

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:14.560 align:middle line:84%
essential oils at
your fingertips,

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.410 align:middle line:90%
and breathing more deeply.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Colors can affect us.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:22.813 align:middle line:84%
Wearing blue and green
are calming colors,

00:54:22.813 --> 00:54:24.730 align:middle line:84%
whereas red might be a
good color for when you

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:28.060 align:middle line:90%
want to have more motivation.

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What about supplemental
therapy in addition to any

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:32.290 align:middle line:90%
of this?

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:38.178 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I always think
food first and herbs second,

00:54:38.178 --> 00:54:40.720 align:middle line:10%
but there are some supplements
that would be good to consider

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.970 align:middle line:10%
if someone is dealing
with addiction.

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And a calcium
magnesium supplement

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:48.540 align:middle line:84%
can help calm the
nervous system.

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.800 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty simple.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.540 align:middle line:10%
A B vitamin complex is going
to help us to have more energy

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.240 align:middle line:10%
and to feel more serene.

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.800 align:middle line:90%
I think of GTF chromium.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:04.650 align:middle line:84%
The GTF stands for
glucose tolerance factor,

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.530 align:middle line:84%
can help keep our blood
sugar levels stable.

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So that can be a
really good one.

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Some people might find
fish oils to be of benefit.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:18.120 align:middle line:84%
There's also vegan sources of
omega-3's, like eating chia

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:24.540 align:middle line:84%
seeds, or walnuts, or even
superfoods like spirulina.

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:27.630 align:middle line:10%
So those are some of the main
things that I would think of.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And then there's even more
high tech supplements.

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
described in my book,

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:34.810 align:middle line:90%
"Addiction-Free Naturally."

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.500 align:middle line:10%
But you could consult
with a practitioner

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:42.540 align:middle line:10%
and see if maybe GABA or
5-HTP would be helpful.

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:46.470 align:middle line:10%
But I also think it's good
if you go see a practitioner.

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Bring all the
supplements, and drugs,

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and vitamins that
you're already using

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:53.340 align:middle line:84%
because there are some things
that might be contraindicated.

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.040 align:middle line:84%
If someone's on
antidepressants, you might not

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.990 align:middle line:90%
want to add certain herbs.

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's really good,
whatever health practitioner

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:04.710 align:middle line:84%
you go see, to let them know
the whole plethora of things

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:06.600 align:middle line:90%
that you might be using.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope people are taking
notes because you are

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.830 align:middle line:90%
a plethora of information.

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And please let us know where
people can find you to learn

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:17.760 align:middle line:90%
more about what you're sharing.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.220 align:middle line:84%
You can find me at
brigittemars.com.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:24.298 align:middle line:10%
I have a phone app
called iPlant that has

00:56:24.298 --> 00:56:25.590 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of plant information.

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:26.880 align:middle line:10%
I have 14 books.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're talking about
"Addiction-Free Naturally."

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:34.010 align:middle line:90%
And I have a YouTube station.

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.340 align:middle line:90%
So there, check it out.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.510 align:middle line:84%
We have only
scratched the surface

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:41.060 align:middle line:84%
on what herbs and
plants can do for us.

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And you, obviously, are
living what you're sharing.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is of great value to
me and I know to the viewers

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.700 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:53.150 align:middle line:84%
When you said you were with 50
years experience, I'm thinking,

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:55.130 align:middle line:84%
now she doesn't look
like she's old enough

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.530 align:middle line:90%
to have 50 years of experience.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, you're walking
your talk and a living example

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.980 align:middle line:90%
of what this can be for us.

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:02.960 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:04.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm honored.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Many blessings to you
and all our listeners.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, wonderful.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to break
the bank to break free

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.890 align:middle line:90%
from addiction and dependence.

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:14.418 align:middle line:90%
You can do so naturally.

00:57:14.418 --> 00:57:16.460 align:middle line:84%
If you are making that
first step in your journey

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to recovery, it is still
important to consult a health

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.330 align:middle line:90%
care professional, of course.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't suffer
from an addiction,

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.720 align:middle line:84%
we can apply what we've
learned here today to detox,

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.870 align:middle line:84%
curb cravings, and improve
our overall health.

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter.

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.680 align:middle line:84%
