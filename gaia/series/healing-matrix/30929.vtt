00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
How many times have we

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:10%
read inspirational books
or attended seminars

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:10%
that offer profound
information and felt

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:10%
all aglow, for a
little while anyway,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.267 align:middle line:10%
only to return to
our usual self?

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
By this time, you probably
feel you've wasted your money

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and time because you couldn't
apply the information.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a good
reason for that.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious, which runs
95% of your life experience,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:90%
has its own habitual agenda.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
It can't be changed by simply
introducing new information.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
It has to be deeply
reprogrammed,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
which is something
we can all do.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Joe Dispenza
is with us today

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:84%
to tell us the mechanics
of how to truly

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:84%
have a shot at becoming
the person we want to be.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.602 align:middle line:84%
No New Age wishful
thinking here.

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what I love
about your work.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to see
you again, Dr. Joe.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE DISPENZA:
Happy to be with you.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's been five years!

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.114 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: I know.

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do you mind?

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:90%
I talked to you off camera.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.248 align:middle line:90%
And you already said it's OK.

00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:27.079 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't what
I would normally do.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But I want to start by reading
a paragraph in your book

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.702 align:middle line:84%
because it sets up a context for
everything else, in my opinion.

00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So it says here on page 102,
"If the quantum model of reality

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.406 align:middle line:84%
ultimately defines
everything as energy,

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:84%
why do we experience
ourselves more

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:84%
as physical beings
than beings of energy?

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
We could say that the
survival-oriented emotions,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
emotions or energy
in motion, are

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
low-frequency or
low-energy emotions.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They vibrate at a
slower wavelength

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, ground
us into being physical.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
We become denser, heavier,
and more corporeal

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
because that energy causes
us to vibrate more slowly.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
The body quite literally
becomes composed

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of more mass and less energy,
more matter, less mind."

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, people are saying,
what do you mean mind?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
You were just
talking about energy.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And so, I would love for you
to take off and just give us

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:84%
a little primer on why this
is central to everything

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:90%
else we do and you do.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:10%
I mean, living in survival
is living in stress.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:10%
And stress is when your body
is knocked out of homeostasis.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:10%
Stress is when your body
is knocked out of balance.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:10%
The stress response is
what our body naturally

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.814 align:middle line:10%
does to return
itself back to order.

00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have different
types of stresses.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We have physical
stresses like accidents

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:90%
or injuries or traumas or falls.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We have chemical stresses
like viruses and bacteria

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and hangovers and blood sugar
levels and hormones in foods.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have emotional stresses
like traffic jams and internet

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
connections and second
mortgages and single parenting

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and 401(k)s.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
In every one of those
things-- physical, chemical,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
or emotional-- the body
responds by turning

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.961 align:middle line:90%
on a primitive nervous system.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.335 align:middle line:84%
And that primitive
nervous system

00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
is called the "fight or
flight" nervous system.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
experiencing a threat

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
in our external environment,
we mobilize an enormous amount

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
of energy to protect the body
in its external environment.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, those hormones of
stress, those chemicals,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:90%
produce a rush of energy.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And that rush of
energy wakes us up

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to be more present
with three things.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:90%
We become focused on our bodies.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We become focused
on the environment.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:90%
And we become focused on time.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, all organisms in nature
can handle short-term stress.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
A zebra gets chased
by a lion, 15 minutes

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
goes back to grazing, and the
body returns back to balance.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
But human beings are
a little different.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
When we turn on the
stress response,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:84%
we can turn it on
by thought alone.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
We can begin to think
about some future event.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
We can begin to anticipate
some worst-case scenario.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:84%
We can begin to expect something
to happen in our future

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:90%
based on our past.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And we make thought more
real than anything else.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And the body
physiologically changes

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
as if that future
event is happening.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And we experience the
stress of that future event.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
By the same means, we can unfold
the past bitter memory that's

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:84%
tattooed in the recesses
of our gray matter

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and, like magic,
it comes to life.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And in that moment, it's real.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And the body as the
unconscious mind

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
does not know the difference
between the actual experience

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that produces the
emotions and the emotions

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
that we fabricate
by thought alone.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.867 align:middle line:84%
So the hormones of
stress, then, then

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
begin to push the genetic
buttons that create disease.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a scientific fact.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And no organism in nature is
designed for long-term stress.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you and I are living
under the gun of the fight

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:84%
or flight nervous system, we're
mobilizing all of this energy.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:84%
The rush of energy
becomes highly addictive.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
This becomes almost an
across the board type

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
of reaction on the whole
spectrum of emotions

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:84%
from positive to
negative, right?

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But the survival
emotions give the body

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
that rush of energy like
a triple cappuccino.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to subconsciously
or unconsciously associate

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
the problems and the
conditions in our life

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
to reaffirm our emotional
addiction so that we

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
can remember who we think
we are as a somebody.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So we keep the problems
and the circumstances

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
in our life to
reaffirm how we want

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:90%
to feel based on that emotion.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the emotions of anger,
of hatred, of aggression,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.870 align:middle line:84%
of competition, of control,
of fear, of anxiety, of guilt,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.216 align:middle line:84%
of shame, of insecurity,
of unworthiness,

00:05:55.216 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
of fear-- all of those
emotions, those emotions

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
are the emotions driven
by the hormones of stress.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And those emotions, then, cause
the ego to become selfish.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
We become self-indulgent,
self-centered, self-serving,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:90%
self-aggrandizing.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the self.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the zebra is
being chased by the lion,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
she's only concerned
about three things.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:90%
I got to take care of this body.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Where in my environment
am I going to run?

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And how much time do
I have to get there?

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So the body, the
environment, and time.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you and I live
by those lower emotions

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that I just talked about, we
begin to identify ourselves

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.677 align:middle line:84%
as a body in this
environment and time.

00:06:44.677 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We're concerned about
our bodies, what

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.907 align:middle line:84%
we look like, what
our faces look like,

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
our wardrobe, the things
that we have in our life,

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:84%
the things we don't
own, our problems.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:90%
We obsess about time.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:84%
We become over focused
on these things.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, when those
hormones of stress are running,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:90%
we become materialists.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:84%
We begin to try to define
reality through our senses.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where we become
more matter and less energy,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:90%
because we become materialists.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And if the atom is 99.99999%
energy and possibility,

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
we're focusing on the particle,
the 0.00001% of reality.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.044 align:middle line:84%
And we're missing out
on a lot of potentials.

00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about how you correlate, then,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:90%
energy to mind.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Because that whole
paragraph spoke

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:90%
of energy, energy, energy.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Now you say, more
matter, less mind.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think about
it, quantum physics

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:84%
says that your
subjective mind has

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
an effect on the
objective world,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:84%
that mind and matter are
co-related, their co-mingled.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you're trying
to change your life

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
by the emotions of
survival, your functioning

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.872 align:middle line:84%
is more matter and less mind, so
you have no control or dominion

00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
over anything in your
life because you're

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.935 align:middle line:84%
vibrating at the
same frequency--

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very low frequency.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.599 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: --as matter.

00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So you exert very little
influence on the outcome.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.565 align:middle line:84%
So now, when you and I are
in the creative state, when

00:08:07.565 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
you and I are truly
focused on creating,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.112 align:middle line:90%
this amazing thing happens.

00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:12.195 align:middle line:90%
We forget about ourselves.

00:08:12.195 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We become
nobody, no thing, no time.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:90%
We become pure consciousness.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:90%
We become pure mind.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment
we walk through the door

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:90%
to the quantum field.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
We no longer are
focusing on the particle.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we're focusing
on possibility.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And when an observer takes its
attention off the particle,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:84%
it turns into energy
and information.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you and I are
observing our life

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
from the same level of
mind every single day,

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
we keep infinite
patterns of information

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
collapsed into the same
reality called our life.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So then, in order for you to
change something on your body,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
change something in
your environment,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
or change some future time, you
have to forget about your body.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to forget
about your environment.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:90%
You have to forget about time.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:90%
You have to become selfless.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So going from
selfish to selfless

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
means we have to lay down
the very thing we used

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
our whole life to get
what we want for something

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:90%
greater to happen.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And that requires, then,
dissociating and disconnecting

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:84%
from our environment,
our body, and time.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And it requires, then,
taking our attention

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
off the emotions that
reaffirm the addiction that

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:90%
keeps us human.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:90%
So beautifully put.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And I see these patterns
with some people

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I know quite well, where there
is, maybe, one element of life

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.580 align:middle line:90%
that is not certain.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And so, they'll go into a
survival mode that becomes

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
this... it's a
loop-- good people.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't allow them
to take their eye

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
off the ball of their own
reality, to become selfless.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.449 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes very
self-obsessive.

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, the
peopel who-- you can always

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.649 align:middle line:84%
tell a person who is
struggling with those emotions,

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:84%
because they'll only
talk about themselves.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:90%
It's never about you.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
They can't think greater
than how they feel.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, feelings
become the means of thinking.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And what they don't
know that they're doing

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:84%
is they're creating a thought
that produces an emotion that's

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
addictive that causes them to
think equal to how they feel.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And they create
a state of being.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a scientific fact
that the chemicals of stress

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
disregulate and down-regulate
genes and create disease.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you know that we can
turn on the stress response

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
just by thought alone, it
means, then, our thoughts

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:90%
can make us sick.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So the question is if our
thoughts can make us sick,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:90%
can our thoughts make us well?

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Because according to the
quantum model of reality,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:84%
all disease is a
lowering of frequency.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to
elevate your frequency,

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
your body becomes more
energy and less matter,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
you become more wave
and less particle.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And you excite photons
into this state

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
where you begin to
broadcast new information.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
most people, then,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
they try to create a
new personal reality

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.672 align:middle line:90%
as the same personality.

00:11:06.672 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do it.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't do it.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.621 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You literally
have to become somebody else.

00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So the new science of
neuroplasticity and epigenetics

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
says that we're not
hard-wired to be

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
a certain way the
rest of our lives.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
doomed by our genes,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.267 align:middle line:90%
that we're marvels of change.

00:11:22.267 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you're thinking the
same thoughts-- I mean,

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:90%
think about this.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
The average person thinks
about 60,000 to 70,000 thoughts

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:90%
in one day.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Out of those 60,000
to 70,000 thoughts--

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and 90% of them are the same
thoughts as the day before--

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.999 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that just awful when you
think about the implications.

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: So think about it.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Same thought leads
to the same choice.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Same choice creates
the same behavior.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Same behavior creates
the same experience.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
The same experience
produces the same emotion.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And that same emotion
inspires the same thought.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:90%
And we call that a personality.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So by the time
we're 35 years old,

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:84%
our biology becomes equal
to how we think, how we act,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:90%
and how we feel.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So we fire and wire the
same circuits in our brain.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:90%
They become hard-wired.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:90%
We execute the same behaviors.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:90%
We reaffirm those circuits.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.149 align:middle line:84%
Those behaviors create
the same experiences

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:90%
that produce the same emotions.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes familiar to us.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So then, when a person has
to cross the river of change

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:84%
from the old self to
the new self, the moment

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
they start making a change-- and
the hardest part about change

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
is not making the same
choice as you did the day

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
before-- all of a
sudden they don't

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:90%
feel like themselves any longer.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:90%
You know what they do?

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
They return back
to the same choice

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.762 align:middle line:84%
so they can feel the same
way because, God forbid,

00:12:37.762 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:90%
they don't know who they are.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what you say,
well that's just how I am.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
You start living the
"that's just how I am"

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
kind of life, which
for most people

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:90%
is not good enough for them.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people would
say, well, if I could,

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:90%
I would change a few things.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Very few people I
know of have life

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.724 align:middle line:84%
nailed exactly the way
they want to have it wired.

00:12:56.724 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But don't
you think, though,

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.917 align:middle line:84%
that most people
wait for crisis--

00:12:59.917 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --or trauma
or disease or diagnosis?

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.778 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unfortunately,
that is the fate

00:13:03.778 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:90%
of the human condition.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We reach
our lowest denominator

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:90%
to decide to change.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
And my message is why wait?

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
You can learn and change in
a state of pain and suffering

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.205 align:middle line:84%
or you can learn and change in
a state of joy and inspiration.

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice, isn't it?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I could
not agree more.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And what you were talking
about a moment ago,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
you were-- So what
I'm understanding

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
here is that we
are now body-bound.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:84%
When we're in this lower
survival-kind-of-thought,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
self-centered, just as a
reaction to survival itself,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:84%
then we're also cutting
ourselves off from

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of reaching
into any of the higher,

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:90%
finer aspects of mind.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And there was a model that
I found very useful once

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.495 align:middle line:84%
upon a time about the
nature of matter and us.

00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:10%
And it was that if
you were to look

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:10%
at our solar system and
the sun and the planets

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:10%
as an atomic function, you
would have as much space

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:10%
in every atom of
the body as you see

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.561 align:middle line:10%
within our solar system, the
distance between the planets

00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:10%
and the sun.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.768 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How can we
be anything but mind?

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:10%
But space?

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.152 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is just
an illusion, isn't it?

00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:12.860 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.151 align:middle line:10%
And you know, it's interesting.

00:14:14.151 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:10%
Because I think that
we view our life

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.876 align:middle line:10%
through the lens of the
past, that the brain is

00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:10%
a reflection of
everything you've

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:10%
experienced in your life.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So the brain is an
artifact from your past.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And emotions and feelings
are the end product

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:90%
of past experiences.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And so people live by certain
emotions that define them.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether its suffering or
victimization or aggression

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
or anger or
judgment, that's kind

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
of the state of being that
they've become accustomed to.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So we could say, then,
the emotion, then,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:84%
becomes the lens that
they view reality through.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So then, if you're thinking
certain thoughts that

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
create certain feelings,
and those feelings

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:84%
are driving the same
thoughts, then in a sense

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
you're conditioning your body
and mind to live in the past.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot create a
new future holding onto

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:90%
the emotions of the past.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is where people
begin to look at themselves

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
for the first time and
say, are these thoughts

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:90%
really serving me?

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Are these behaviors and habits
that I'm demonstrating really

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:90%
part of my future?

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And are these emotions
affecting anybody else but me?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm pushing--

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's your creation.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --my own
genetic buttons, you know?

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.670 align:middle line:90%
So you can blame the person.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
You can blame the
condition in your past.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, you still
have to transmute that emotion

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:84%
into wisdom, because a memory
without the emotional charge

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
is called wisdom.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the name
of the game here.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So forget about the event,
just look at the emotion

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:90%
that you're living by.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And look to see if that
emotion is part of your future.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And if it isn't, then you
have the choice to leave it,

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:84%
because a wealthy person,
an abundant person,

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.875 align:middle line:84%
would never think
lacking thoughts.

00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You do have
the choice to leave it.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.541 align:middle line:84%
However, it's not as
though there might not

00:15:57.541 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:90%
be a tad of resistance.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So can we talk about the
slave-master relationship

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:90%
between the mind and the body?

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking
about some intelligences,

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
in and of themselves,
that also fight

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:90%
to protect their own existence.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So I think that,
you know, we were

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
talking about by the time we're
35 years old, 95% of who we are

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
is a set of memorized behaviors,
emotional reactions, beliefs,

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
perceptions, attitudes that run
just like a computer program.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
You turn them on and
they run automatically.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:90%
So people get up in the morning.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:90%
They brush their teeth.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.170 align:middle line:90%
They take a shower.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
They wash themselves in
the same routine way.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.924 align:middle line:90%
They drive to work.

00:16:38.924 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
They see the same
people that push

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.485 align:middle line:90%
the same emotional buttons.

00:16:41.485 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
They do the same
things that they

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:90%
memorized and can do so well.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, most people
are functioning unconsciously.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So now, if 95% of
who you are is that,

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:84%
then you're using 5%
of your conscious mind

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to go against the program
that's been memorized.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, a habit is when the
body becomes the mind.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking
certain thoughts

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
and those thoughts are
producing emotional reactions

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals in your body,
and those chemicals drive

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:84%
the same thoughts, and you
keep that loop going on and on,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:84%
you'll condition your body
to memorize, subconsciously,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.374 align:middle line:90%
lack, unworthiness, insecurity.

00:17:19.374 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And it'll run without
your conscious mind.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So then, when you come time to
change and you begin to say,

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:28.574 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to think
these thoughts any longer.

00:17:28.574 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be a victim.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to complain.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to make excuses.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.403 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to feel
sorry for myself.

00:17:33.403 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
judge anybody else,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're breaking
that chemical continuity

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:84%
between the mind
and the body, well,

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
once the body becomes the mind,
the servant is the master.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the body
begins to-- just like anything

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that you've trained,
it's the animal.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It's going to begin to send
signals back to the brain.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to say
things like, why don't you

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
start tomorrow, any
other day but today.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Today's not a good
day to change.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:84%
You're too much
like your mother.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.754 align:middle line:84%
You've tried this in the
past, it didn't work.

00:18:03.754 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't feel right.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we respond to
that voice as if it's true,

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
we return back to the same self,
thinking the same thoughts,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
performing the same actions,
and living by the same emotions.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But crossing that
river of change,

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
then, means when you
become conscious that it's

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
your body trying to be the mind,
and it's giving it its best

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:84%
effort to cause
you to return back

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:84%
to the way you've
programmed it to be.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:84%
When you step out
into the unknown

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and it feels uncomfortable
and it feels unfamiliar,

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
this is the best
place to create from,

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
because now the best way
to predict your future

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.060 align:middle line:84%
is to create it
from the unknown.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where
a person begins

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to think about who they
want to be in their future.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.562 align:middle line:84%
They begin to imagine
what behaviors

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:90%
they're going to demonstrate.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:84%
They begin to fall
in love with how

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
it's going to feel ahead
of the actual event.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to teach
their body emotionally

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
what it feels like to
live in that future.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And the body as the
unconscious mind

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
does not know the difference
between the actual event

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:84%
in reality and the emotions they
are creating by thought alone.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're signalling
new genes in new ways.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And their brain and
body begin to look

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
like the experience
has already happened.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, when your brain
and body are physically

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
changed-- there's
physical evidence

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:84%
to look like the event
has happened-- then

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:84%
the event has already
happened in the quantum field.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.366 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:28.366 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now, this is where
you get to relax and allow

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the universe to organize it
in a way that's right for you,

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:90%
that you least expect.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Why would it have to be
that we least expect?

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can expect
it, it's nothing new.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:90%
It's got to rock your world.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It's got to catch you off
guard and leave no doubt

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that what you did inside
of you produced some result

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.932 align:middle line:90%
outside of you.

00:19:49.932 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking
about letting go of control.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:84%
When we're living by
the hormones of stress

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and survival, we'll always
try to control the outcome

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and force the outcome,
because we feel separate

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:90%
from possibility.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:90%
We're matter not energy.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.860 align:middle line:84%
When we really move into
the state of creation

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and the survival emotions
that are normally

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
endorsing these hormonal centers
is moving into your heart,

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.915 align:middle line:84%
because the identity is
gone, the ego is gone,

00:20:13.915 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
the energy has to
move somewhere.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The first place it moves
is into your heart.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to fall in
love with your creation.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:84%
The moment that
happens, now, you

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.520 align:middle line:84%
begin to free the
body from the chains

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:90%
of its emotional addiction.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's no longer
living in the past.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And that liberation of
energy is what we call joy.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.506 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, you
trust in the outcome.

00:20:37.506 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't know how
it's going to happen

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
or when it's going to happen,
but it's not your job,

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
because now, you're
going to allow a greater

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
intelligence to
organize it for you.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:51.449 align:middle line:84%
This is the difficult part
because trusting means, then,

00:20:51.449 --> 00:20:52.365 align:middle line:90%
it's already happened.

00:20:52.365 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to live as if
your prayer's already answered.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
normally you're waiting to

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:90%
have some kind of validation.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:57.718 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:20:57.718 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you
start to analyze

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:84%
where it's going to come and
when it's going to come--

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --you just
return back to the old self.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The magic goes away.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You just return
back to the old self.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
The new self would
never think that way.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:90%
They're too busy being it.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So then, this is where
your friends start to say,

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.010 align:middle line:90%
are you on a new medication?

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Or what's up with you?

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Because you're exuberant.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you're creating
a future, and you

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.670 align:middle line:84%
move into an elegant
state of creation,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and your heart is
open-- and the research

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.164 align:middle line:84%
shows that the field
around the body,

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
when you start
opening your heart,

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:90%
goes to nine meters wide.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:84%
You become more energy
and less particle.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:84%
You're broadcasting a whole
new electromagnetic signature

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:90%
into the field.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Then, you get up and you're in
a state of reverence and joy

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and then, 15 minutes later,
you're driving down the freeway

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and flipping everybody off and
cursing and judging everybody.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
You just returned back
to the old identity.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to maintain
that modified

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:90%
state of mind and body.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the purpose
of all of this.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it would be like
eating an organic breakfast

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
with vegetarian
breakfast and food

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
combining properly
and then spending

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.890 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the day
eating junk food.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.350 align:middle line:84%
To be able to maintain that
modified state of mind and body

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.415 align:middle line:90%
is really the task.

00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is the task.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It's where the
commitment comes in.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.671 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's
where greatness is born.

00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So meditation, then, is to
alter your state of being

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and then sustain that
change the entire day.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the test.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:90%
And the one day is one lifetime.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
That you are able
to master that day,

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
then, begins to allow you
to leave your past behind

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:90%
and create a new future.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Even just
starting with an hour,

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:10%
to just watch your own
thoughts for as much as an hour

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.482 align:middle line:10%
and see where the
habitual nature comes in.

00:22:41.482 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:10%
I think most people, if you
make a study of yourself,

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:10%
would be absolutely shocked
and sometimes appalled

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.055 align:middle line:10%
to think of how unoriginal
our thoughts are day-to-day.

00:22:49.055 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Well, people
always ask me, well,

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:10%
how did I create this disease?

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:10%
Or how did I create
this accident?

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:10%
I always say, you created
that accident by not creating.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we are left to
the randomness of reality.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.680 align:middle line:10%
But if you want to look
at how the disease may

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:10%
have been created, close
your eyes for an hour

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:10%
and watch your thoughts.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:10%
Watch your urges, your emotions.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And it's that state
of being-- it's

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.070 align:middle line:10%
the same information
to the cell.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
There's no new experience
that's signaling any new genes.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you keep pushing
the same genetic button,

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:84%
the gene begins to wear out
and starts to malfunction.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Give the body new
information, and it

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.199 align:middle line:90%
begins to respond to a new mind.

00:23:26.199 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Now this brings us to some
really interesting stuff

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.546 align:middle line:90%
you've been up to lately.

00:23:31.546 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
About three or
four months ago, I

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
interviewed Jeffrey Fannin,
neuroscientist, years ago,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Konstantin Korotkov.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And both of them are up to
some very interesting work.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And you brought them
together with yourself

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:84%
to start looking--
well, you tell us

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:84%
what you began doing in
this experimentation.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the results
are really fascinating.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote my first
book, "Evolve your Brain,"

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
the book was about spontaneous
remissions of disease.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.791 align:middle line:84%
So I went to 17
different countries

00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and studied people all
over the world that

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.330 align:middle line:84%
were diagnosed with
health conditions.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were treating
conventionally or

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:90%
unconventionally.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were staying the
same or getting worse.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.497 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they got better.

00:24:11.497 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to know
what the cause was

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.590 align:middle line:90%
that produced that effect.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So we found four common
things that they had.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
the book was about.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we did
"What the Bleep."

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.647 align:middle line:84%
And then, afterwards,
people start saying, well,

00:24:25.647 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:90%
that's really great information.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it?

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So we started teaching workshops
around the world and really

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:84%
teaching people the
how to process--

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that's what the second book is
about, "Breaking the Habit"--

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to demystify the mystical so
that you begin to understand

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:90%
how to do it.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.185 align:middle line:84%
Well, people came to events and
more events and more events.

00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, they kept wanting
more and more and more.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And we started having
more advanced workshops.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, the last workshop
we did in Colorado here,

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
last spring, we had
seven people that

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:84%
had spontaneous
remissions from disease.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:24:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: During the conference?

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: During
the conference, yeah.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So these were
quantifiable remissions.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:84%
They were signaling
new genes in new ways,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:84%
people that had MS, that
couldn't feel their leg

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:84%
or couldn't walk were having
complete function in their leg.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
We had people with celiac's
disease completely go away;

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
chronic bladder infections
their entire life,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
complete remission;
a Hashimoto syndrome.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had all kinds
of significant changes.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know I'm a
scientist in my mind.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
we're teaching people.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.090 align:middle line:84%
We should be able
to reproduce this.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And we're reproducing it now.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And now that we
can measure and see

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that subjective mind is
producing an objective effect,

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.870 align:middle line:84%
let's find out what's
going on in real time.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So we had a workshop
in Phoenix last month,

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:54.340 align:middle line:84%
200 folks-- these are advanced
students in the meditations--

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and we brought in Dr. Jeffrey
Fannin and Dr. Konstantin

00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Korotkov.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.529 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be able to
measure real-time changes

00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
in folks that were going
through transformations.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, Jeffrey is
working with neuro-feedback,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:84%
a sophisticated type of
neuro-feedback device.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, he's using
QEEGs or electroencephalograms.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And Konstantin is
measuring energetic patterns,

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.682 align:middle line:84%
energetic changes in
the space of the room--

00:26:19.682 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing technology.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.765 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --energentic
patterns and changes

00:26:22.765 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
around the field
around the body,

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and the alignment of the
energy centers in the body.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And within the first
day, these guys

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:84%
were blown away by the
changes that they saw.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the
event, we were capturing

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.720 align:middle line:84%
some brainwave patterns and
some energetic patterns that

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:84%
were really, really
quite spectacular.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the process of
crunching those numbers.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:84%
We're in the process of
looking at the effects.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But again, the concept was
information to transformation.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:84%
How masterful were
the people that

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
were involved, in terms of
their meditation skills?

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really down to
these states of consciousness.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
There were folks that were doing
some pretty amazing things,

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:84%
really, really
spectacular stuff.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, we were watching
one woman in her meditation

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and, all of a sudden, she went
into a very, very elevated

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:84%
state of gamma brain
waves, which usually

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.275 align:middle line:84%
happens with
super-consciousness.

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, monks.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.575 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But
at the same time,

00:27:25.575 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:84%
she was having all of this
extended delta and theta.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that she was going
into bliss in that moment.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And we turned and
looked over at her.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know, she just

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.320 align:middle line:84%
started sobbing from
joy in the next moment.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And the brain was in
such a level of coherence

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that phase patterns
were so organized,

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.379 align:middle line:84%
there was such a whole
functioning of the brain--

00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You would
normally not see that--

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You don't
see that too often.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --gamma, alpha, and
delta working at the same time,

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.535 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We were seeing it in
lot of folks by the third day.

00:27:57.535 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And the best part
about it is they

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.100 align:middle line:84%
didn't have to be
Buddhist monk to do it.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
They just had to retreat from
their life for four days;

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
surrender the emotions and
states of mind and body

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
of the past; spend the second
day finding the present moment,

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:84%
which is difficult
for a lot of people--

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.570 align:middle line:84%
but when you find that sweet
spot of the present moment,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that's where all possibilities
exist-- and then,

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
move into a new state of
being and create a new future.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And boy, the energy
of the room--

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I looked back at this
strip-chart that we were

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.150 align:middle line:84%
measuring fluctuations in the
field during the event and--

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Konstantin's
technology.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.541 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Konstantin's
technology--

00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:36.474 align:middle line:84%
measuring the energy of
the space of the room.

00:28:36.474 --> 00:28:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we got
to that third day,

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I glanced down at the
strip-chart analyzer.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And it went like
this, "whissch."

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.835 align:middle line:90%
It went up like a volcano.

00:28:43.835 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh my god,
it's really happening.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing this,
really, to close

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.930 align:middle line:84%
the gap between science
and spirituality.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:84%
If transformation is
happening and we're

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:84%
seeing biological
effects, then there

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.084 align:middle line:84%
should be something
happening in real-time

00:29:00.084 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:84%
that we should be
able to measure.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to measure
that and energetic changes

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.690 align:middle line:84%
in people's field and energetic
alignments in their energy

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:08.590 align:middle line:90%
centers or chakras.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.790 align:middle line:90%
We saw dramatic shifts in that.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:17.466 align:middle line:84%
So this process was just
a hypothesis for me.

00:29:17.466 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I figured,
what the heck.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're
getting the results.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.406 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing medical feedback
from scans and blood tests,

00:29:26.406 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:84%
We get emails and, of course,
the first line in every email

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:84%
is, you're not going to
believe this, which we love.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:84%
We know the evidence
is coming next.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So because of
that, we want to be

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.575 align:middle line:84%
able to show that there's
coherence going on

00:29:41.575 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, that both
hemispheres are firing

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:84%
in unison, that there is phased
synchronization going on,

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the amplitudes are
healthy, and the brain

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:84%
is working in a different
ratio between our thinking

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
brain and our
subconscious brain.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And these people
were, without a doubt,

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:84%
really, really doing
some amazing things.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
makes total sense.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview
with Patrick Flanagan.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And we talked a little bit about
his device, the Neurophone,

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:84%
which is to, essentially, allow
for-- through technology--

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:14.075 align:middle line:84%
this quickened communication
signaling between the right

00:30:14.075 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and left hemisphere
of the brain.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking
him, well, what are

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.886 align:middle line:90%
some of the effects of that?

00:30:17.886 --> 00:30:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
the sharpness of the mind IQ

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.432 align:middle line:84%
but, also, immune
system function.

00:30:23.432 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.639 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That if
you have coherence

00:30:25.639 --> 00:30:27.600 align:middle line:84%
between the right
and left hemispheres,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.564 align:middle line:84%
your body can start responding
to that almost instantly.

00:30:31.564 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, it's very
interesting that you say that.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go back
to the original question

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that when we're
living in survival

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're throwing out all
of this energy for some threat

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.230 align:middle line:84%
in your external environment,
real or imagined,

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.270 align:middle line:84%
you have very little energy
in your internal environment

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:84%
for growth and repair, for
long-term building projects.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and isn't that
just engaging, more or less,

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.070 align:middle line:84%
one hemisphere of the brain
when you're in survival?

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.952 align:middle line:84%
You're not crossing
over too much there

00:30:58.952 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:90%
into the creative side.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.576 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, the
bridge between two

00:31:01.576 --> 00:31:03.450 align:middle line:84%
hemispheres-- the
hormones of stress

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.200 align:middle line:84%
slow down conductivity
between both hemispheres.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
We tend to lateralize to
one side or the other.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, my current
theory about love,

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that psychic union
that transcends words,

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:84%
is when you have a
union of polarity,

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.520 align:middle line:84%
when both hemispheres
are no longer judging

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.040 align:middle line:84%
good and bad, right and
wrong, positive and negative,

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:84%
male and female,
past and future.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:84%
When both brains begin
to work in coherence,

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and you see this kind
of orderliness that's

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.620 align:middle line:84%
going on between
both hemispheres,

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that type of psychic
orderliness or coherence

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.760 align:middle line:84%
is the union of those
two specific things.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And the brain is functioning
in a state of wholeness.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing you could say
is you feel whole and complete.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And all the things that
you thought you wanted,

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:90%
you no longer want.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Because in order
for you to want,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
you would have to
be polarized again.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the most familiar
unfamiliar feeling.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand
what you're saying.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but then
again, that's what

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.540 align:middle line:84%
you experience in these
higher states of meditation.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to
do is elongate them

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:90%
into a state of being.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.690 align:middle line:84%
We want people to be
able to open their eyes

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and be able to have this level
of unconditional state of joy

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:84%
inside of them that they
no longer need the sports

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:24.770 align:middle line:84%
car or the boat or the
gambling to try to create

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:84%
a change in their
feeling by using

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:90%
something outside of them.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And that really is when true
joy and happiness is created.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And we started
seeing some of that.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.984 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you
say, spontaneous healing.

00:32:35.984 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Spontaneous
healing happens as a result.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the disease actually
exists in the old personality.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist in
the new personality.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The person is
literally, chemically,

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:51.030 align:middle line:84%
neurologically, and
genetically somebody else.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have to visualize
the cancer falling off.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.324 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to--

00:32:56.324 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
have to elevate

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.700 align:middle line:84%
your state of
consciousness to coherence.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, those elevated emotions
of gratitude and joy and love,

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:08.350 align:middle line:84%
those are the natural human
states of consciousness.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:84%
The survival states are altered
states of consciousness.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.100 align:middle line:84%
We've just been hypnotized
into believing the opposite.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And we've been
hypnotized into believing

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:84%
that you need a reason
for joy, that you

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.030 align:middle line:90%
need a reason to give thanks.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the Newtonian model of
reality, of cause and effect.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Wait for something
outside of you

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:84%
to change how you
feel inside of you.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.407 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel
differently inside of you,

00:33:30.407 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:84%
you pay attention to who
caused it outside of you.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.920 align:middle line:84%
That's how we associate
with our environment.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.530 align:middle line:90%
That's cause and effect.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:84%
The quantum model of
reality is the opposite.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.820 align:middle line:90%
It's about causing an effect.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It's changing how
you think and feel

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and giving thanks ahead
of the actual event,

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.790 align:middle line:84%
so much so that your body
as the unconscious mind

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.610 align:middle line:84%
begins to believe the
event has already happened.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the emotional
signature of gratitude means

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:84%
it's already happened or
it is happening to you.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you get to
that level of gratitude--

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:84%
true gratitude, not an
intellectual process,

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
but you begin to
feel it-- your body

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.650 align:middle line:90%
does not know the difference.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:84%
And you're literally switching
on new genes in new ways.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.909 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to know certain
things about who you're being.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
And those elevated emotions then
carry a different frequency.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.929 align:middle line:84%
And you become more energy,
more mind, less matter.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about some of the ways

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:26.830 align:middle line:84%
in which we have been
reinforced to be how we are.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Because toward the
end of our chat,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.574 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get into some of
the basics of what you do.

00:34:31.574 --> 00:34:33.449 align:middle line:84%
And one of them-- I love
this-- is how do you

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:84%
release frozen energy
into the quantum field?

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:38.365 align:middle line:84%
We're going to spend the last
portion of the show on maybe

00:34:38.365 --> 00:34:40.489 align:middle line:84%
even some-- you can share
some techniques with us--

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mm-hmm.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I'm sure,
without-- really, people

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.290 align:middle line:84%
need to come to a
course or read the book.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of information there.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.339 align:middle line:84%
But to understand the nature of
how we got into this situation

00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:51.830 align:middle line:84%
in part, let's look at it
from a mass consciousness

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:52.719 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Now we're looking at mass
beliefs as a culture.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at mass
media, mass-- kind

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.376 align:middle line:84%
of a hypnagogic state
that we're put into.

00:35:01.376 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking
about, seems to me,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
would almost require us
to literally disconnect

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.580 align:middle line:90%
from the messages at large.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about cultures,
caste systems, and so forth.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
culture is really

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.520 align:middle line:84%
the reflection of
how people survive

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.540 align:middle line:84%
in a certain
environmental condition.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, different people in
different parts of the world

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.350 align:middle line:84%
have different cultures
based on the food they grow,

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.140 align:middle line:84%
whether they're near water,
their altitude, how they

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:90%
commingle, et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The 21st century
and the 20th century

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.530 align:middle line:84%
has been the indoctrination
into this belief

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that we need something
outside of us to make us happy

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and that the events
that have occurred

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.600 align:middle line:84%
over the last
couple hundred years

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.920 align:middle line:84%
are still alive in a
lot of cultures' minds.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And those beliefs, some of
them support the evolution

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.370 align:middle line:90%
of a culture.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And others really restrict
the expansion of a culture.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And a belief is
just a thought you

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:84%
keep thinking over
and over again.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.440 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you have a belief
that germs make you sick,

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:84%
if you have a belief that
women are less than men,

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:84%
if you have a belief
that spirituality looks

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:84%
a certain way, and you
conform to those beliefs,

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.410 align:middle line:84%
they limit the
flow of the Divine

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:84%
through individuals
because it separates them

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:90%
from their true nature.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And independent of a person's
culture, their tradition,

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:35.300 align:middle line:84%
their religion, their
gender, their social status,

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
their race-- that there's
an intelligence that's

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:90%
giving them life.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.700 align:middle line:84%
That divine intelligence
transcends all of those things.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is a time in history
where all of those separate

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.120 align:middle line:84%
"-isms" are beginning to
collapse, the political model,

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.544 align:middle line:84%
the economic model,
the educational model--

00:36:54.544 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Scientific models.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --scientific
models, the religious model,

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:01.370 align:middle line:90%
the environment.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:04.115 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're starting
to see a collapse

00:37:04.115 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of these so-called structures
because information

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.630 align:middle line:90%
is so readily available.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, because you
can research anything

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.980 align:middle line:84%
now-- I used to have
to go to the library

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and pull these massive books off
the shelf, and sit in a room,

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and fumble through
all these pages.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And you could-- at
your very fingertips--

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Look at the medical model.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.094 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago, you were
diagnosed with a condition,

00:37:28.094 --> 00:37:30.010 align:middle line:84%
the doctor told you you
needed this procedure,

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:84%
you signed on the dotted
line, and it was over.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Fast forward to today.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.840 align:middle line:84%
The doctor tells you
you have a condition.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:84%
You go on the internet
for the next two days

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and you research it better.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.029 align:middle line:84%
And you know more about that
condition than your doctor.

00:37:42.029 --> 00:37:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And you say to your doctor, I
want to try this new procedure.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor says, well, I
don't know anything about that.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.716 align:middle line:90%
Or that's not going to work.

00:37:47.716 --> 00:37:48.780 align:middle line:90%
And you say, really?

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Time to find a new doctor.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Because people
are now wanting to

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.240 align:middle line:84%
empower themselves
with information.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So, classic time in history
because the traditional models

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that are based on
the past have nothing

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.830 align:middle line:90%
to do with a new future.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And so, waking up to
this time, right now,

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.870 align:middle line:84%
is really saying to
every individual,

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.600 align:middle line:84%
if you want peace in the
world, you better not

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
be arguing with your
neighbor, because you

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.670 align:middle line:84%
have to demonstrate peace
everywhere in your life.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:23.720 align:middle line:84%
If you have a problem
with war or the government

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.910 align:middle line:90%
taking things, start giving.

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to demonstrate
all of that.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, you
give people permission

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.330 align:middle line:90%
to do the same in their lives.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So because of
globalization, there's

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.590 align:middle line:84%
a collapse going on in a lot
of these social structures

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and really giving
people permission

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.430 align:middle line:90%
to step outside of them.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a really
healthy time to be alive.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
it's fascinating.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.840 align:middle line:10%
I look at this, where
you have stuck scenarios

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:10%
like the Hatfields and McCoys.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:10%
And another one that is very
controversial to even bring up,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.010 align:middle line:10%
which is the notion of what
happens in the Holocaust,

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.310 align:middle line:10%
for example, where the
theme is "never forget."

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.210 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:04.640 align:middle line:84%
What kind of pain is perpetuated
if a group of people,

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
or a family, or an individual
has been through something

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.170 align:middle line:84%
extraordinarily
traumatic and painful.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet, chooses to
commit to keeping

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that very memory alive through
repetition, repeating stories,

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.880 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.180 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
I'll speak about it

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:84%
from a biological
standpoint, which

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:27.310 align:middle line:84%
is the safest
scientific standpoint.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:30.800 align:middle line:10%
Memories are just thoughts
that stay in the brain.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:10%
And if you keep firing and
wiring the same circuits,

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.140 align:middle line:10%
you begin to cause
long-term relationships.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Learning is making
new connections.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Remembering is maintaining them.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So then, if we keep
the same level of mind

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.980 align:middle line:84%
going every single day,
then our brain literally

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is keeping those
circuits in place.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's nothing wrong with
remembering the experience.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you can
remember the experience

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:90%
without the emotional charge--

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, see, now
that's the key, isn't it?

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.856 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --then you are
free from the experience.

00:40:01.856 --> 00:40:03.992 align:middle line:90%
Look at Nelson Mandela.

00:40:03.992 --> 00:40:04.700 align:middle line:90%
One of my heroes.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [COUGH]
Yes, perfect example.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.266 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And
why do I love him?

00:40:07.266 --> 00:40:09.670 align:middle line:90%
27 years in prison, OK?

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:84%
First 10 years of
his life, he hated.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.890 align:middle line:90%
He was angry.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.812 align:middle line:84%
And he said to
himself every day,

00:40:17.812 --> 00:40:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
get out of here.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
get out of here.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:84%
He kept thinking it, I'm never
going to get out of here.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can just feel
the poisonous chemicals

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.175 align:middle line:90%
coming into the body and brain.

00:40:26.175 --> 00:40:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And he
did it for 10 years.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.975 align:middle line:90%
And finally, he paused.

00:40:28.975 --> 00:40:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what if I
could get out of here?

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.270 align:middle line:90%
What if I could get out of here?

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And he started thinking
the "what if" question.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, he was stepping
outside of his environment

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and his culture.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was willing
to make a difference.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So he starts
thinking about, what

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:90%
could I do to get out of here?

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.970 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, he
thinks, he gets this idea,

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start writing
letters to the United States.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So every week he wrote
letters and wrote more letters

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.870 align:middle line:84%
on apartheid and,
finally, he started

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:84%
gaining a lot of
political attention.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, he was standing
outside of his cell one day,

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and he thought, who's
going to lead this nation?

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.230 align:middle line:90%


00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
next thought is,

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.170 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I could
lead this nation?

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the key point.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:19.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, what would I have
to change about myself

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.090 align:middle line:90%
to be a leader of this nation?

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:21.835 align:middle line:90%
Now this--

00:41:21.835 --> 00:41:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a profound and--

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --is where you've
got to leave bitterness behind.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to leave betrayal
and hatred behind.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to leave anger and
judgment, prejudice, holding

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.670 align:middle line:84%
grudges-- In 27 years
in the crucible,

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.490 align:middle line:84%
he took base metals,
those survival emotions,

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.230 align:middle line:90%
and turned them into gold.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And because he transmuted
those emotions,

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.350 align:middle line:84%
there isn't an ounce of
malice in that man's body.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:52.740 align:middle line:90%
He gets to lead a nation.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So then, we're defined
by our adversity.

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
look at the emotion

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and really realize
that that emotion is

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:04.520 align:middle line:84%
the residue from the past,
then when we begin to say,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.370 align:middle line:84%
this emotion, then, and these
behaviors and these habits

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and these attitudes don't
belong to the ideal self

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.490 align:middle line:84%
in the future, and you begin
to observe them-- look,

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:18.280 align:middle line:84%
this concept in neuroscience
called meta-cognition, the fact

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.856 align:middle line:84%
that we can think about
what we're thinking about,

00:42:20.856 --> 00:42:21.980 align:middle line:90%
to notice how we're acting.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That self-recognition.

00:42:22.615 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, we can pay
attention and become conscious

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.218 align:middle line:90%
of our unconscious behaviors.

00:42:26.218 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It means we can modify
our states of being

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.170 align:middle line:90%
to do a better job in life.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.030 align:middle line:90%
That's how we learn.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the
size of the fore-brain

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and the frontal lobes.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that you're
observing the self

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.260 align:middle line:84%
means that you're no
longer the program.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But you're the consciousness
observing the program.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
That's when you begin to
objectify the subjective self.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.400 align:middle line:84%
This is when you begin to
detach from the programs.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
step to change.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want to talk
about another area

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that I think most people
in Western culture--

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and probably globally--
now struggle with.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is, life has
been, so to speak, wired.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And part of it because
of survival issues,

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.970 align:middle line:84%
basic day-to-day
stuff you talked

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:08.990 align:middle line:84%
about in the first
minute of the show.

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.500 align:middle line:84%
We are stuck in this high
beta or this beta state.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And basically, we're
just grinding, grinding,

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.930 align:middle line:84%
grinding in this beta
state, which really

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:22.100 align:middle line:84%
is the antithesis of going
into the flow of the other part

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.430 align:middle line:90%
of their true mind.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I'm so glad you
realize that, because this

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
is the paradigm where
people get stuck.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're analyzing your
life within the emotions

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.270 align:middle line:84%
that you've memorized
based on survival,

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:36.915 align:middle line:84%
you're firing and
wiring the circuits

00:43:36.915 --> 00:43:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and driving your brain into a
higher, more analytical state

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and away from the
operating system where

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.080 align:middle line:90%
true change takes place.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:44.597 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:43:44.597 --> 00:43:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we pride
ourselves in the West

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:47.530 align:middle line:90%
on this high beta state.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah,
and how's it working?

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah!

00:43:49.015 --> 00:43:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not working
too well, is it?

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More pharmaceuticals--

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
high beta, what

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.220 align:middle line:84%
it is, what happens
chemically, and how

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:90%
we end up in this space.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So, when we're
under the fight or flight

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.020 align:middle line:84%
nervous system, we have to
get a super rush of energy.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And the brain has to
become super alert.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
become super vigilant

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.100 align:middle line:90%
because there's an emergency.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle line:90%
We're now in high gear.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have three
levels of beta.

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.230 align:middle line:90%
You have low-level beta.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you and I pretty
much are in low-level beta.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:84%
If I said to you,
listen, I'm going

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to test you on all
of this material.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't pass the
test, you can't leave tonight.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.390 align:middle line:84%
You may move into a
little mid-range beta.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, high-range beta
is, like, twice as high

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:26.810 align:middle line:90%
as mid-range beta.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you're freaked
out, when you're scared,

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.530 align:middle line:84%
when you're angry,
when you're frustrated.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And in high-range beta, it's
like driving your sports car

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.790 align:middle line:90%
in first gear.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And the brain begins
to break down.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And the patterns that you
see on EEG readings become

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:44.710 align:middle line:84%
very incoherent,
disorganized, disintegrated.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:47.042 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, in your
book, I love the graphs

00:44:47.042 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:84%
you have on that,
very interesting.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So in high beta,
you believe that the outer world

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.130 align:middle line:84%
is more real than
the inner world.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And in high beta, your
brain is running a loop,

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're overly
analyzing your problems.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And the analysis is causing
the emotions to be reinforced.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to
realize that in order

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:84%
for you to change,
your brain has

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.730 align:middle line:84%
to move from beta to
alpha-- and in alpha,

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:17.290 align:middle line:84%
the inner world starts to become
more real than the outer world.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:20.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're addicted
to those emotions,

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.785 align:middle line:84%
no new information can come
into the nervous system--

00:45:22.785 --> 00:45:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like a wall.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.868 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --that is
not equal to the emotion.

00:45:25.868 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, when
people get in this state,

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.700 align:middle line:84%
they get lost, because
they can't hear it

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.045 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
a time to learn.

00:45:36.045 --> 00:45:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not a time for
new information.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to
react and survive.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So when the emotions
get highly addictive

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and the brain moves
in this pattern,

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.300 align:middle line:84%
people are trying
to force the outcome

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and use the ego to
change their life.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, moving into
meditative states

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.800 align:middle line:84%
is moving into
those alpha states

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.170 align:middle line:84%
where you begin to
eliminate the information

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.950 align:middle line:90%
from the external environment.

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to
slip back into alpha,

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.940 align:middle line:84%
your thinking brain
quiets way down.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.835 align:middle line:84%
Now, people do
this all the time.

00:46:04.835 --> 00:46:05.960 align:middle line:90%
They don't know they do it.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.560 align:middle line:84%
When you're driving
down the road

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.960 align:middle line:90%
in your car and all of sudden--

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.627 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --somewhere
just above delta!

00:46:12.627 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
you're trancing out.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking
about something.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
aware of your body.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the road or
the environment of the--

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
lost track of time.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You've
lost track of time.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Your brain moves
from beta to alpha.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.560 align:middle line:84%
We could say that,
in that moment,

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.870 align:middle line:84%
the inner world became more
real than the outer world,

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:29.940 align:middle line:84%
the imaginary world became more
real than the external world.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're in high
beta, that never happens.

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain doesn't pause
enough to store information.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, it's
funny because you'll

00:46:37.905 --> 00:46:41.000 align:middle line:84%
see at conferences,
spiritual conferences,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.166 align:middle line:84%
you'll see different
kinds of personalities.

00:46:43.166 --> 00:46:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's there
for their own reason.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But I've always wondered
about individuals

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:52.070 align:middle line:84%
when you see them just
taking notes, detailed notes,

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and using the analytical
process so much.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I always wonder, is
anything actually coming in?

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe it's just a
process for some minds' need

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.900 align:middle line:84%
to hold on and analyze and
record to maybe take it

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.200 align:middle line:90%
in later on.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.735 align:middle line:84%
But it almost seems like
it's blocking the experience.

00:47:08.735 --> 00:47:11.662 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You know, knowledge
is the precursor to experience.

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:84%
The more knowledge
you have, you're

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.670 align:middle line:84%
more prepared for
the experience.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when you go
to these conferences-- and this

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.400 align:middle line:84%
is why I've kind of stopped
doing a lot of the conferences

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and keynotes, because
it's philosophy.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Until you initiate
that philosophy,

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:29.990 align:middle line:84%
until you initiate
it and practice it

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.230 align:middle line:90%
does it become truth or wisdom.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So if people need to write that
stuff down and ideo-motorwise

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.200 align:middle line:84%
create some circuits
in their brain,

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they pay
attention, then go for it.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But don't sit there and
analyze the information.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Take the information and
ask this simple question:

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:49.260 align:middle line:90%
how can I use this in my life?

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you start
applying it, you just

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.810 align:middle line:84%
went from the philosopher
to the initiate.

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
reproduce an experience

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.400 align:middle line:84%
based on the knowledge you
learn over and over again,

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.690 align:middle line:84%
now you're beginning to
master that knowledge.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:08.620 align:middle line:84%
You go from knowing all
the way to knowingness.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.214 align:middle line:84%
You know to knowing
to knowingness.

00:48:10.214 --> 00:48:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to that
point of knowingness,

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.990 align:middle line:84%
where you know that you
know, or you know how,

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.492 align:middle line:84%
but you've done it
so many times you

00:48:17.492 --> 00:48:20.390 align:middle line:84%
don't even know how you know
how, it's now innate in you.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.100 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
need to go as a culture.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.680 align:middle line:84%
We need to, all
of a sudden, break

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.270 align:middle line:84%
from these
philosophical arguments.

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why we're
doing the workshops,

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:36.330 align:middle line:84%
because we're all about,
really-- it's a time in history

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.540 align:middle line:90%
not just to learn information.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a time in history,
really, to learn

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:90%
how to use that information.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time,
going back the other direction

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.080 align:middle line:84%
again-- because I'm just trying
to cover all the influences

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're under so we can
recognize them and break that

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.950 align:middle line:84%
spell-- the media
takes advantage

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.740 align:middle line:84%
of these frantic,
survival-oriented, high beta

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.406 align:middle line:84%
states of mind and
further reinforces them.

00:49:00.406 --> 00:49:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And you and I, in our
last conversation,

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.140 align:middle line:90%
spoke a little bit about that.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But mostly we were talking
about the effects in that area

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.962 align:middle line:84%
of what happens when
children start becoming --

00:49:11.962 --> 00:49:15.930 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
addicted, that's not it--

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.780 align:middle line:84%
entrained to video
games, for example.

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, this gets into
ethical, moral things.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.020 align:middle line:84%
We get into, now, the drones and
the drone issue and the people

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:90%
that operate them.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So in a short bit--
because then I

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.730 align:middle line:84%
want to get into some of what
you do in your workshops--

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:36.170 align:middle line:84%
how do we address this mass
kind of enslavement, entrainment

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:37.840 align:middle line:90%
by media and video games?

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mmm.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:46.570 align:middle line:84%
If you took one hour of your day
and retreated from your life,

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:51.950 align:middle line:84%
truly shut off your cell phone,
powered down the computer,

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:53.375 align:middle line:84%
you got up at 5:00
in the morning

00:49:53.375 --> 00:49:56.520 align:middle line:84%
or whatever time is good
for you before your day,

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.420 align:middle line:84%
when your brain is
already in alpha

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and the brain chemistry
is just right to dream,

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and you sat down
and you said, what

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:07.690 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest ideal
of myself that I

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.350 align:middle line:84%
want to present to
the world today?

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And you sat there and you
changed your state of being,

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.300 align:middle line:84%
you worked until you
were that person,

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.530 align:middle line:84%
you would have to forget
about the people in your life,

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the things that you
have to do, the things

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.130 align:middle line:84%
you own, the places you have
to go at different times,

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and all the experiences
in your life

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:31.090 align:middle line:90%
that reaffirm your identity.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:35.770 align:middle line:84%
You would have to get beyond
yourself in that moment.

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you become conscious
of your unconscious self,

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.750 align:middle line:84%
you are less likely
to be controlled

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:46.260 align:middle line:84%
because you are no longer
being manipulated emotionally.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can manipulate
people with fear.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.920 align:middle line:84%
You can manipulate
people with need.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.390 align:middle line:84%
You can manipulate
people with lack.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:55.880 align:middle line:84%
You can cause people
to consume because they

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.910 align:middle line:90%
don't look a certain way.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And so this indoctrination
into this idea

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:03.670 align:middle line:84%
that you can rely on
something outside of you

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.300 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel
better is the exact way

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.430 align:middle line:90%
you control a culture.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.910 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to transmute
those survival emotions

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:16.310 align:middle line:84%
into elevated states, and
the joy and the love for life

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.330 align:middle line:84%
is within you,
you're more awake.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:20.992 align:middle line:84%
And when everybody's
looking one way,

00:51:20.992 --> 00:51:22.200 align:middle line:90%
you're looking the other way.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're no longer
manipulated by fear.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went to an
event in Santiago.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.570 align:middle line:84%
There was 1,000
people in my audience

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and half the people were wearing
masks because of the avian flu.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, you cannot
believe that to be the truth.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:90%
It's just not that way.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So you produce something
in the marketplace

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.320 align:middle line:84%
that creates a little
fear, that people

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.890 align:middle line:90%
think they have free will.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:48.270 align:middle line:90%
They don't have free will.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:49.800 align:middle line:84%
You think, oh, I'm
going to choose

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.035 align:middle line:90%
Bayer instead of Excedrin.

00:51:52.035 --> 00:51:52.910 align:middle line:90%
That's not free will.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:55.160 align:middle line:84%
That's making choices
based on knowns.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.690 align:middle line:10%
Free-willed
individuals, genius, is

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:10%
someone who steps
outside of convention

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.060 align:middle line:10%
and who's willing to stay
outside of convention

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.730 align:middle line:10%
until they produce an effect.

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:08.030 align:middle line:10%
And they go from being
foolhardy and insane to becoming

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:09.580 align:middle line:10%
a mystic or a saint.

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:11.930 align:middle line:10%
But there's enough
people in this world now

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:13.720 align:middle line:10%
that are beginning
to wake up and see

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.355 align:middle line:10%
through the deceit and the
greed and the competition

00:52:16.355 --> 00:52:18.820 align:middle line:10%
that that is not
the model that's

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.310 align:middle line:10%
going to sustain a culture,
because no organisms in nature

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.300 align:middle line:10%
survive in competition.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:27.300 align:middle line:10%
They survive when they cooperate
and they worked together.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.600 align:middle line:10%
It's a time, this is
a nodal point for us

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.620 align:middle line:10%
to begin to wake up.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, back to
the original idea,

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.770 align:middle line:84%
we have to demonstrate that
in every area of our life.

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you're changing
you, and I'm changing me,

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm giving up
resentment and hatred,

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're giving up
jealousy and envy,

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's no longer in
the fabric of your being,

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and people are
noticing those changes,

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:48.310 align:middle line:84%
imagine the effects
it has in the world.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:51.160 align:middle line:84%
We're not waiting for a
Gandhi or a Martin Luther King

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.830 align:middle line:90%
or a Joan of Arc.

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:55.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the time when you
and I and the simple person

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.970 align:middle line:84%
has to be able to
demonstrate it.

00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And science is the language
to really demystify it.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what unifies
the culture and tradition

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and religion.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.696 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment you start
talking about tradition

00:53:05.696 --> 00:53:07.460 align:middle line:84%
or culture or
religion, you begin

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.850 align:middle line:90%
to separate your audience.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:10.806 align:middle line:84%
Science has become the
contemporary language.

00:53:10.806 --> 00:53:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you can take
just one minute or so

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and address the-- and again,
I would recommend watching,

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'll mention that again
later, our first interview.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle line:84%
You went into some great
depth on the subject

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.890 align:middle line:84%
of how the brain is entrained,
how the cell memory is

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:29.640 align:middle line:84%
entrained, when you're
getting your kicks,

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.780 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep pushing
and pushing the envelope.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.020 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get to that today.

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But we did talk
about it last time,

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.460 align:middle line:90%
and video games and little kids.

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.960 align:middle line:84%
What would you say
to moms and dads?

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, listen,
I mean in my house

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.500 align:middle line:84%
with my kids were growing
up, here's the rule,

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.747 align:middle line:90%
we had five seconds.

00:53:42.747 --> 00:53:44.830 align:middle line:84%
If I asked you a question
and you couldn't respond

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:46.740 align:middle line:84%
in five seconds, then
you were addicted.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Game over.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.564 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
killing somebody,

00:53:49.564 --> 00:53:51.730 align:middle line:84%
you're shooting somebody,
you're blowing somebody up

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:54.250 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, there's
a release of dopamine

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:54.820 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure chemical.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you squirt out all that
chemistry and norepinephrine,

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.100 align:middle line:84%
when you keep doing
it, the receptor sites

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.890 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of the
cells become desensitized.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So the next time you play,
they need a little bit more

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.910 align:middle line:90%
to turn them on.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And so, the pleasure
centers in the brain

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.220 align:middle line:84%
start recalibrating
to a higher level.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're addicted,
because you cannot get the same

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.380 align:middle line:90%
rush as you did the day before.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.442 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about this.

00:54:21.442 --> 00:54:25.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a tragedy because, in
the absence of that chemicals

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:28.110 align:middle line:84%
rush, they can't find
pleasure in anything.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:30.845 align:middle line:84%
You say, go watch a sunset or
let's go see your grandmother

00:54:30.845 --> 00:54:32.990 align:middle line:84%
or let's go take
the dog for a walk.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, they just murdered
a whole civilization

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.362 align:middle line:90%
in their video game.

00:54:37.362 --> 00:54:39.320 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to find
any pleasure in that.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, learning should be a
reward in and of itself.

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And the children now can't
find pleasure in learning,

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and they have to wake their
brain up just to turn it on.

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:48.610 align:middle line:84%
They're going to act
out and get in trouble.

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have a culture
now that's based on,

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:53.462 align:middle line:84%
when they get older and
have problems in their life,

00:54:53.462 --> 00:54:55.170 align:middle line:84%
instead of facing off
with the problems--

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you fall back on?

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, they're
going to look for something

00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:58.600 align:middle line:90%
to make those feelings go away.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
true of adults as well.

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.831 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyone that gets
into any addictive behavior,

00:55:02.831 --> 00:55:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the addiction itself is a
result of that body-bound aspect

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:12.250 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness having to
keep upping the ante and stakes

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:14.760 align:middle line:90%
chemically to be able to feel.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Sure, and
you become more matter.

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you try
to change yourself,

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.490 align:middle line:84%
if the ego tries to
change the ego functioning

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:28.610 align:middle line:84%
as more matter and less
consciousness or less energy,

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:30.550 align:middle line:84%
then it always
becomes impossible

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:32.517 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
get beyond the program

00:55:32.517 --> 00:55:33.350 align:middle line:90%
in order to do that.

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:37.744 align:middle line:84%
And in our workshop when we
were studying the first day,

00:55:37.744 --> 00:55:40.160 align:middle line:84%
where people were going back
into their past and observing

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:43.210 align:middle line:84%
themselves, you know, lighting
the match in a dark place--

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:47.010 align:middle line:84%
it's important to do that--
we saw just high-level beta

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.650 align:middle line:84%
patterns in the brain
and people were--

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:49.025 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --freaking out.

00:55:49.025 --> 00:55:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.578 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: They
were going for it!

00:55:50.578 --> 00:55:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to
really, really transmute that

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.090 align:middle line:90%
into something else.

00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But the message was, that state
is how you function every day.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And you try to change
you when you're

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.880 align:middle line:84%
a biological machine
running as a program

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're not the consciousness
operating the brain and body,

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.280 align:middle line:90%
then you can't change it.

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.307 align:middle line:84%
And you'll just be left
to the genetic program.

00:56:11.307 --> 00:56:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
absolutely fascinating.

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:14.769 align:middle line:84%
And again, I mean, you
have a couple books,

00:56:14.769 --> 00:56:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and also in our
previous conversation

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:18.070 align:middle line:84%
you went into it
at length-- now,

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:19.300 align:middle line:90%
you just mentioned something.

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.008 align:middle line:84%
These people would go
into the beta state

00:56:21.008 --> 00:56:24.860 align:middle line:84%
when they're having to light
a match in a dark place-- we

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.390 align:middle line:84%
talked about this
a little bit ago--

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:28.880 align:middle line:84%
how does one begin the
process of releasing

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that frozen energy,
as you call it?

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, emotions
are energy in motion.

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you're experiencing the
same emotion as the day before,

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:40.310 align:middle line:84%
then your energy is the
same as the day before.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And as long as your energy is
the same as the day before,

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:45.575 align:middle line:84%
everything's going to stay
the same in your life.

00:56:45.575 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
your frozen energy.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's
your frozen energy.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we
want get rid of that.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So, if you were to
close your eyes, right?

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Or, better yet, let's
start off with something

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:57.270 align:middle line:90%
a little simpler.

00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:59.410 align:middle line:84%
You write down an
emotion, let's just

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:02.550 align:middle line:90%
say anger or, more, hatred.

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:07.770 align:middle line:84%
That emotion is connected
to some person or something

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:10.110 align:middle line:90%
or some experience in your past.

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And you are energetically
bound to that past event.

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to
look, that this emotion

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that I'm having is
keeping me connected

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:24.670 align:middle line:84%
to this past experience,
and you begin

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:29.032 align:middle line:84%
to become conscious of how you
think when you feel that way.

00:57:29.032 --> 00:57:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Just write down how you
think when you feel that way.

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Begin to notice
how you behave when

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:36.810 align:middle line:90%
you're living by that emotion.

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
observe yourself.

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:44.890 align:middle line:84%
You will begin to denature that
particular biological state.

00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And the more you become
familiar with it--

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and the word
"meditation" literally

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:52.690 align:middle line:84%
means to become
familiar with-- the more

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.730 align:middle line:84%
you become conscious
of, it means then you

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:59.720 align:middle line:84%
are transmuting those
emotions, freeing them

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.812 align:middle line:90%
from the mind of the body.

00:58:00.812 --> 00:58:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And people would
say, well, I don't

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:04.353 align:middle line:84%
want to think about how I
think when I'm that way.

00:58:04.353 --> 00:58:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, everybody else
can see you, you know.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.520 align:middle line:84%
You look at yourself through
the eyes of somebody else.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So the observation
process is the key.

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:14.420 align:middle line:84%
We ask people,
then, once they're

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.140 align:middle line:84%
clear on who they're
being, to surrender

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.500 align:middle line:84%
that state of being
to a greater mind.

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It will resolve it in a
way that's right for you.

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And the true side effect
of doing that properly

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.450 align:middle line:90%
is the elevated emotion of joy.

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, the process
of surrender then,

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.290 align:middle line:84%
is giving it up to a greater
authority, to a greater

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:35.230 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, to the field.

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But you have to first
really know thyself

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:38.890 align:middle line:90%
in order to do that.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So we spend the process of
the thoughts and the behaviors

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and the emotions that really
are connected to the old self

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to be able to become
so conscious of them

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:50.812 align:middle line:84%
that they would never slip
by your awareness unnoticed.

00:58:50.812 --> 00:58:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this is sort
of a beginning point when

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:53.300 align:middle line:90%
you're looking--

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --beginning
point, yeah.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's huge.

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We
have of advanced--

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's kind of
the heavy lifting too.

00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's
the heavy lifting.

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And we see people
struggle with that

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:02.780 align:middle line:90%
because they don't want to look.

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look at
what happens after that.

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So we've gotten through
this part of it.

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mm-hmm.

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So what we know
from our research

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is that when people
really free themselves

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:16.340 align:middle line:84%
from those emotional states--
because the question is, have

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.570 align:middle line:84%
you ever done that
to anybody else?

00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:22.140 align:middle line:84%
The answer is yes, then it's
time to come to the altar

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:24.550 align:middle line:90%
and free them and free you.

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So once you begin to
surrender the past,

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:34.090 align:middle line:84%
the body naturally starts to
relax into the present moment.

00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:38.280 align:middle line:84%
When your mind and body slip
into the present moment,

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.630 align:middle line:84%
you will forget
about time and space.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the biological
machinery to do that.

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.230 align:middle line:84%
In that mystical
moment of where you

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:49.550 align:middle line:84%
are nobody, no thing,
no time, the brain

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:51.520 align:middle line:90%
naturally recalibrates.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.850 align:middle line:84%
It begins to become
very organized.

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And what we know
from our research

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:59.060 align:middle line:84%
is when you focus on
nothing-- that's it,

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.390 align:middle line:84%
when you focus on
nothing, you focus

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.180 align:middle line:84%
on the wave instead
of the particle,

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.480 align:middle line:84%
you focus on energy
instead of matter,

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.240 align:middle line:84%
the brain naturally goes from
that disintegrated, incoherent,

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.750 align:middle line:84%
imbalanced, stress
state, high beta state

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:15.160 align:middle line:84%
to a more orderly, a more
phase-synchronized, a more

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.900 align:middle line:84%
patterned, coherent
states of the brain.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the different
compartments of the brain that

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.020 align:middle line:84%
weren't talking to each other,
that were driven by the stress

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.970 align:middle line:90%
hormones, begin to shake hands.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:27.070 align:middle line:90%
They begin to connect.

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And you start feeling
more like yourself

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.130 align:middle line:90%
than you've felt in a long time.

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And that coherent signature is
sending a very coherent message

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:35.850 align:middle line:90%
to the nervous system.

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And the immune
system gets rebooted.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.540 align:middle line:84%
The digestive system
comes back online.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:43.470 align:middle line:84%
The cardiovascular system
starts working in harmony

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.400 align:middle line:90%
with the brain.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing rhythmic
harmonies and patterns.

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, that place is not the end.

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the place that you have
to become relaxed and poised

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:55.830 align:middle line:90%
in.

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.065 align:middle line:84%
And you have to begin to
allow the brain and body

01:00:58.065 --> 01:00:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to become familiar
with that state.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Now you're in fertile ground.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Now it's time to create.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, from that
place of wholeness

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
or that place of
orderliness, when

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.550 align:middle line:84%
you begin to command
matter in your life--

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
because you're the
quantum observer.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:15.931 align:middle line:84%
You can't command matter as
your jealous, insecure, fearful

01:01:15.931 --> 01:01:16.430 align:middle line:90%
self.

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:17.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

01:01:17.263 --> 01:01:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You have to command
matter with the same attributes

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:22.626 align:middle line:84%
as the observer that's
created all of this,

01:01:22.626 --> 01:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
in a loving, intelligent place,
in the state of gratitude,

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
in a state of commitment,
in a state of will.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen people in a
very short amount of time

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.830 align:middle line:84%
do amazing things to their
body and in their life

01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:39.380 align:middle line:84%
by commanding matter from
an elegant state of being.

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I like that, from
an elegant state of being.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
This is just an
aside, but did you

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
measure people going
through that process?

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.253 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, oh absolutely.

01:01:47.253 --> 01:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Going through that
letting go process and watch

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that burst through of letting
go of that fear and high beta

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.930 align:middle line:90%
and hatred and giving way--

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You watched it?

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:57.713 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We watched
transformation.

01:01:57.713 --> 01:02:02.677 align:middle line:84%
It was clinically and
statistically significant.

01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:04.010 align:middle line:90%
And we'll have all the research.

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll publish the research.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty behind
it all was that these

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.837 align:middle line:84%
were common folks
like you and me.

01:02:08.837 --> 01:02:09.919 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I love this.

01:02:09.919 --> 01:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have only a
couple minutes left.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So now we've talked
about the fertile ground.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.809 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm saying people
need to either connect

01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
with your book-- you need to
make a commitment to this.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.350 align:middle line:84%
We can't talk about
the entire solution

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
in the next few minutes
or even the first hour.

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, in
brief, thumbnail sketch,

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
where do you go from there and
what is the shining outcome?

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, for
me, I'm the happiest

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:38.390 align:middle line:90%
when I'm contributing.

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I measure
transformation

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
or see transformation,
whether I'm in Japan or China

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
or in Mexico or the United
States or Canada or London,

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
transformation looks the
same on every person.

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, demystifying
this concept of transformation.

01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't need anything
outside of us to do it.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:02.420 align:middle line:84%
We have within our reach all the
tools and biological machinery

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to do it, and to make it so
reproducible and so simplified

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that the person begins to
realize that they've always

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.240 align:middle line:90%
had it within them.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They just forgot.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Look, you and I have done
amazing things in our life.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:18.270 align:middle line:90%
We just haven't made it a skill.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And making it a skill, the
hardest part of all of this,

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:24.340 align:middle line:90%
is making the time to do it.

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:24.955 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:03:24.955 --> 01:03:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:28.397 align:middle line:84%
And in your book, you talk
about how here you were.

01:03:28.397 --> 01:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
You were off lecturing
here and there.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't have
time to even practice

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:33.060 align:middle line:90%
what you were talking about.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And you have turned
yourself around.

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:36.500 align:middle line:90%
You look fabulous.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
You've made all kinds of new,
fresh commitments to yourself.

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, just from
the last time I saw you,

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.270 align:middle line:90%
you seem, just, more coherent.

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:45.649 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Thank you!

01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You must have been in
the blush of "What the Bleep"

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:49.370 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you so
much for taking the time.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we'll do this
again in a couple months.

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:54.957 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I go
wherever I'm invited.

01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:59.106 align:middle line:84%
Well, Dr. Joe was right to
write this follow up book,

01:03:59.106 --> 01:04:00.730 align:middle line:84%
"Breaking the Habit
of Being Yourself,"

01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's right on
target in its usefulness.

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
You can find it at Amazon
and other booksellers.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you
might also enjoy--

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned before--
my first interview

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:13.450 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Joe in that Conscious
Media Library on this site.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:40.100 align:middle line:10%
