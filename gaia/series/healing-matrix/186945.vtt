to target various health issues.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.705 align:middle line:10%
Ayurveda, however,
is a philosophy

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.458 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't just see a
single illness or symptom,

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.379 align:middle line:10%
but aims to bring all systems
of the body into balance.

Dr. Nita Desai is a medical
doctor in integrative medicine

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.468 align:middle line:84%
and a certified
Ayurvedic practitioner

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
who specializes in women's

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:84%
how we can experience what
she calls, healthy happiness.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Dr. Desai
to "Healing Matrix."

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.191 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA DESAI: Thank you.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.403 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We're so happy to have
you and your brilliant wisdom

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:10.654 align:middle line:90%
with us today.

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:12.823 align:middle line:84%
And we know that behind
every brilliant mind,

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:13.907 align:middle line:90%
there's a human being.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.493 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell us
your human story

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that brought you into this
specialty, into this practice?

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.041 align:middle line:10%
>>NITA: Well, I started
out in my residency,

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.877 align:middle line:10%
I was just a regular
old family practice

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.964 align:middle line:10%
doctor doing a residency in LA.

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:34.219 align:middle line:10%
And one of my preceptors
knew a lot about Ayurveda.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.639 align:middle line:10%
And so the way that I
got drawn into Ayurveda

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:42.811 align:middle line:10%
and the integrative is I would
come out after seeing a patient

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.982 align:middle line:10%
and he would give me
the simplest advice.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:50.277 align:middle line:84%
Try this, try that, a
lot of home remedies.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.821 align:middle line:84%
And I would go in and I didn't
really know what I was doing,

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.699 align:middle line:90%
but I would relay the message.

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:58.327 align:middle line:90%
And my patients would go home.

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:00.329 align:middle line:84%
And the next time they
would come back to see me

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.371 align:middle line:90%
and they would be better.

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was really surprised.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.377 align:middle line:84%
And so that was my first
introduction to Ayurveda.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.378 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And what did you
notice in your patients,

00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:12.674 align:middle line:84%
in particular, in your
residency program?

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:15.802 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Well, it just seemed
like when he was precepting,

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.431 align:middle line:84%
when he was the one that
we had to ask for advice,

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.891 align:middle line:90%
people seemed to get better.

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.726 align:middle line:90%
They seemed to do well.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:27.314 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like the advice was
really more attentive to what

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
they were asking for, as
opposed to just an agenda

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.444 align:middle line:90%
that you might have.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:35.238 align:middle line:84%
As a medical doctor, we got
to go through this list.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:40.035 align:middle line:84%
And it really was something
that made them feel good.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:43.454 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it was something more
than just stimulus response,

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:44.414 align:middle line:90%
issue, give them this.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.832 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Give them
something that's

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.751 align:middle line:84%
going to improve the
quality of their life.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.086 align:middle line:90%
That's going to make them happy.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:52.339 align:middle line:84%
That's going to make them
feel like they were heard.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.465 align:middle line:90%
And they felt listened too.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.466 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: A visible person.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:55.759 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Yes.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.221 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So maybe you could
just explain for our viewers

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:00.806 align:middle line:90%
about Ayurveda.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:02.766 align:middle line:90%
What it is for you.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So for me, I really look
at Ayurveda as a philosophy.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.315 align:middle line:84%
I feel that you can apply
the principles of Ayurveda

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.192 align:middle line:90%
to just about anything you do.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.444 align:middle line:84%
So as a medical doctor,
I can think of it

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.656 align:middle line:84%
when I need to give
somebody an antibiotic.

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:19.366 align:middle line:84%
I can think about
it if I'm going

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:23.954 align:middle line:84%
to ask someone to take herbs,
or nutrition, or lifestyle.

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.957 align:middle line:84%
But it can be used for
massage, aroma therapy.

00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:31.211 align:middle line:84%
Any modality of healing,
you could use the principles

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.963 align:middle line:90%
or the philosophy of Ayurveda.

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:37.968 align:middle line:84%
Because most of those principles
are really energetic principles

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:39.469 align:middle line:90%
of how you see the body.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.887 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What kind of people--

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.264 align:middle line:90%
who is it that approaches you?

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:44.724 align:middle line:84%
What is the patient
that seeks you out?

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.184 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So being
a medical doctor

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.855 align:middle line:84%
and being that I kind of
integrate functional medicine

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:53.483 align:middle line:84%
and Ayurveda and have
an East-West practice,

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.319 align:middle line:84%
the kind of people I
see tend to be people

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.697 align:middle line:90%
who have seen multiple people.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
They've been to 10
different practitioners.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.161 align:middle line:84%
They've done the whole
Western medicine route.

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:06.705 align:middle line:84%
They've gone to the Mayo
Clinic, or National Jewish,

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.875 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the high
level centers are.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:13.086 align:middle line:84%
And then they also might have
dabbled in some alternatives.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.297 align:middle line:84%
They might have seen a
naturopath, or a chiropractor,

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:90%
or tried acupuncture.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.841 align:middle line:84%
And nothing has really
worked for them.

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.385 align:middle line:84%
So by the time they
come to see me,

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.722 align:middle line:84%
they've really been
through a journey already.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:24.806 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: We are all unique.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:29.269 align:middle line:84%
And we have to find the
path that works for us.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:34.399 align:middle line:84%
And so in this, why do you
feel that healing happens

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
with Ayurveda that it might
not be being accomplished

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.447 align:middle line:90%
with other approaches?

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: I think the energetics
has a lot to do with it.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.952 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
the other approaches

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.372 align:middle line:84%
sometimes don't take
that into account.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.124 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of patients,
especially when

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.377 align:middle line:84%
they're very ill,
there's a weakness there.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.546 align:middle line:90%
There's a delicacy there.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.716 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't take into
account the energetic balance

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:03.303 align:middle line:84%
of that individual, even the
best medicine in the world

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:07.849 align:middle line:84%
can throw them over and get them
out of balance, just because it

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.809 align:middle line:90%
was too much for them.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.686 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I think it's
important for viewers

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.898 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that the energies
that we're speaking about

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.775 align:middle line:90%
are really subtle energies.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.194 align:middle line:84%
And so important
for us to realize,

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.738 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about this
subtle, invisible energy

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes that can
have everything to do with

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.077 align:middle line:90%
whether we heal or not.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.995 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
measure these things

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.747 align:middle line:90%
and reference the doshas.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.125 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain to
us what doshas are

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.962 align:middle line:90%
and share some insights there?

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:39.256 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So because I
do the East-West thing,

00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:42.259 align:middle line:84%
I always like to try
to explain it in a way

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.928 align:middle line:90%
that Westerners will understand.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.013 align:middle line:84%
So when I think of
the doshas, I do

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:51.351 align:middle line:84%
think of them as the
energies that stand behind

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:55.647 align:middle line:84%
and control some of the physical
activities of our bodies.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:06:01.278 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, the vata dosha
is the energetic principle

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
that stands behind
the nervous system

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.241 align:middle line:84%
and controls the nervous
system of the body.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:84%
It controls the
movement, the change.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.912 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's
happening in the body

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:15.792 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with movement,
and change, and transformation.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.587 align:middle line:84%
To some degree,
the vata dosha is

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:21.214 align:middle line:84%
the energy behind that
that's controlling that.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.968 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
the puppet master.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.638 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very subtle,
as you said, concept.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.724 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you just
explain the relationship

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.726 align:middle line:84%
between the elements
and the doshas?

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:33.602 align:middle line:90%
And how many doshas?

00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:34.686 align:middle line:90%
There's three main doshas.

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:35.979 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Three doshas.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.273 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And there are elements
associated with each.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:40.358 align:middle line:84%
Just give us a big
overarching picture

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.485 align:middle line:84%
here for people that
may not be familiar.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.363 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So in Ayurveda, we
talk about five elements.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.994 align:middle line:84%
So the Chinese
medical system chooses

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.204 align:middle line:84%
to leave the five
elements separately

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.081 align:middle line:84%
and they deal with
the five elements

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.875 align:middle line:90%
as five separate elements.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:01.254 align:middle line:84%
We feel that in living things,
in anything that's alive,

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.591 align:middle line:84%
those elements actually
combine in a certain way.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's more relevant
to talk about the doshas.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.974 align:middle line:84%
So we combined wind
and air or space air--

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:17.145 align:middle line:90%
that concept of space--

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.774 align:middle line:84%
and we call the concept of wind
and we combine them together

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.942 align:middle line:90%
and we create the vata dosha.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:27.989 align:middle line:84%
We combine fire and water,
because in human or even

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:30.909 align:middle line:84%
in any biological
system that's alive,

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:34.371 align:middle line:84%
there are no fires
that are without water.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.081 align:middle line:90%
Our fires are biological fires.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.084 align:middle line:84%
They're mostly
biochemical reactions.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.544 align:middle line:84%
And so we combine fire
and water together

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:90%
to create the pitta dosha.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.219 align:middle line:84%
And then we combine
water and earth element

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.554 align:middle line:84%
to do something called
the kapha dosha.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And kapha, again, is in our--

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.517 align:middle line:90%
we're not as hard as a rock.

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.686 align:middle line:84%
We don't have pure
Earth elements.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:02.023 align:middle line:84%
We're a combination for the
physicality of our body.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:06.444 align:middle line:84%
So it's more that Ayurveda likes
to make things easy and simple.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:09.572 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you give us
examples about people having

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.616 align:middle line:90%
a specific dosha imbalance?

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Like, what might be
happening that someone

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.079 align:middle line:90%
would recognize symptoms?

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So the simplest one,
since I live in Colorado,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that I see all the time is
when the vata dosha goes out

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.044 align:middle line:90%
of balance.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.214 align:middle line:84%
So we live at a very high
altitude in Colorado.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.257 align:middle line:90%
It's very dry.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.383 align:middle line:90%
It can be very windy.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.843 align:middle line:90%
It can be very cold.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:33.638 align:middle line:84%
These are all factors that
really aggravate the vata

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:34.639 align:middle line:90%
dosha.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.976 align:middle line:84%
So when the vata dosha
gets more aggravated,

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.227 align:middle line:90%
things start to scatter.

00:08:40.227 --> 00:08:43.565 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see somebody
who's really vata aggravated,

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.108 align:middle line:90%
they feel scattered.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.818 align:middle line:90%
They feel ungrounded.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:50.655 align:middle line:84%
They might have issues
with anxiety or worry.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:51.698 align:middle line:90%
They can't focus.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.409 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how to pull
themselves together and focus.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So that would be an example of
a vata type of an imbalance.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.376 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And people can have
multiple doshas expressing

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:07.338 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, can
you speak about that?

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So a typical
vata person is someone

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.345 align:middle line:90%
who has a lot of creativity.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
They really love to do
many different things

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and they like to dabble in
a lot of different things.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.934 align:middle line:90%
They're open-minded.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.561 align:middle line:90%
They're flexible.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.563 align:middle line:84%
However, somebody
who's very pitta,

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.608 align:middle line:84%
they usually tend to be
more type A. Organized,

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:28.902 align:middle line:90%
get things done type of people.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So you would get your
more type A person

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.865 align:middle line:84%
and then you might get you
a more creative person.

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.659 align:middle line:84%
But then there are people who
are vata and pitta together

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.412 align:middle line:84%
so those people have
elements of both.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And so an example
would be they're

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.999 align:middle line:90%
really good at multitasking.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.375 align:middle line:84%
They can look at
the big picture.

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:90%
See the entire forest.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.003 align:middle line:90%
Be really creative with it.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.922 align:middle line:84%
And then they can take
care of all the details

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.507 align:middle line:90%
and they can go back and forth.

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.133 align:middle line:84%
So that would be an
example of someone

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
who is vata pitta, where
they have two doshas that

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.263 align:middle line:90%
are dominant in their body.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:02.185 align:middle line:84%
And then there's various
versions of that in Ayurveda.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.062 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And do you
see it changing over

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:90%
the course of someone's life?

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.775 align:middle line:84%
Is there a phase in their
life where they're more pitta

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.529 align:middle line:84%
and a phase of their life
where they become more kapha?

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.864 align:middle line:84%
Or is it, pretty much,
here's your signature,

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.491 align:middle line:84%
this is what you're
dealing with?

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:20.328 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Well, everybody has
a signature that they were--

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:23.873 align:middle line:84%
that at the time of
conception from your parents,

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:84%
you inherit a certain
energetic signature.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.712 align:middle line:84%
And we say that is
your constitution.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:34.133 align:middle line:84%
However, it is then influenced
by many, many things,

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.844 align:middle line:90%
the stages of your life.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.679 align:middle line:84%
We say the early
stage of your life

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:41.432 align:middle line:84%
as your growing and building
is a very kapha stage.

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:45.728 align:middle line:84%
The middle stage, after
puberty and until menopause,

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
is sort of your middle stage,
very pitta part of your life.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:55.154 align:middle line:84%
And then usually after menopause
or late 50s, early 60s for men,

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:57.615 align:middle line:84%
it starts to become
the vata part of life.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:01.619 align:middle line:84%
And so the seasons
can affect the doshas

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.955 align:middle line:90%
and your constitution.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.291 align:middle line:90%
Where you live can affect it.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.209 align:middle line:84%
What part of your
life you're in.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:11.296 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things
that can affect it,

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:15.174 align:middle line:84%
even though, the
actual constitution,

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
the actual energetic signature
that you're born with

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.095 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really change.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.724 align:middle line:84%
What changes is how it
goes out of balance.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:26.477 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is I have to figure
out what's your constitution?

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.229 align:middle line:90%
What is going on right now?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.355 align:middle line:90%
How is it out of balance?

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I try to bring you
back into balance, again.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.193 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I know that
at one time I moved

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.654 align:middle line:84%
from being in a clinical
practice, such as yourself,

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.531 align:middle line:84%
into traveling all
the time and teaching.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.951 align:middle line:84%
And I was on airplanes and the
dry, and the wind, the wind.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:42.869 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Yes, the wind.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:46.247 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So I had to
begin some practices--

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.999 align:middle line:84%
Abhyanga, the oils, and
these kinds of things

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:53.338 align:middle line:84%
to bring a harmony into the
energetics of my own system.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.673 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a big fan, definitely.

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:56.466 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Absolutely.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.676 align:middle line:90%
Travel is very vata aggravating.

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:00.595 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, vata
deranged was the word

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.932 align:middle line:84%
that was used to get
you under control here.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:08.061 align:middle line:84%
So I have great appreciation
for what you're doing.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.022 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin
working with someone,

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:84%
is it typically that
you begin with the foods

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.571 align:middle line:90%
and the nutritional component?

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Is that where you typically
begin with people?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.828 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: I usually like to
start with diet, nutrition,

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.413 align:middle line:90%
and digestion.

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle line:84%
Because that's kind of
the core of a person.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.961 align:middle line:84%
We really feel from
Ayurvedic point of view

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.838 align:middle line:84%
that someone's digestive
fire, their ability

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:41.052 align:middle line:84%
to assimilate nutrients is very,
very important to their core

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.261 align:middle line:90%
well-being.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.931 align:middle line:84%
So for that reason,
many, many times,

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:48.643 align:middle line:84%
I will start with
that basic foundation.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:52.397 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And there are so
many diet plans out there

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.316 align:middle line:84%
that people are plugging
into from a variety

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:58.069 align:middle line:84%
of different places, different
reasons and motivations

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:84%
for doing so, how does one
select something that's

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.702 align:middle line:84%
going to work for them inside
of the construct of Ayurveda?

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:07.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So with
Ayurveda, we look at diet

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.205 align:middle line:90%
completely differently.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:13.209 align:middle line:84%
We're not looking at
proteins, fats, carbs.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.919 align:middle line:84%
We're not necessarily
even looking

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.672 align:middle line:84%
at nutrients or
nutrient content.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:21.467 align:middle line:84%
We're really looking at diet
from a completely energetic

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:90%
component.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.429 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing, how is
this going to affect

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:90%
your body energetically?

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.769 align:middle line:84%
So I can, many times, not remove
the entire diet from somebody.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:33.771 align:middle line:84%
If they choose to be
paleo because that's

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.232 align:middle line:84%
something they really
love, I sometimes

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.861 align:middle line:84%
don't even have to remove that
or tell them to change that.

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:42.113 align:middle line:84%
I can just tweak it
a little bit to make

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle line:84%
it more pacifying,
more agreeable

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.826 align:middle line:90%
to their constitution.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.162 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
I work with diet.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:55.001 align:middle line:84%
I like people to have some
flexibility in what they enjoy,

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:58.296 align:middle line:84%
what their lifestyle
is all about.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:13:59.714 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, there's ways

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.632 align:middle line:84%
of tweaking it to make
it so that you're going

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:02.759 align:middle line:90%
to digest the food better.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.427 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: There are
certain foods that have

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.679 align:middle line:90%
certain qualities of energies.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.806 align:middle line:84%
And a person might
have a certain energy

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:12.769 align:middle line:84%
that they're exhibiting or
experiencing at a certain time.

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.604 align:middle line:84%
And it's about
finding foods that

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.648 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to balance
these energies for them.

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:20.234 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us some examples
of a certain kind of food

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of energy quality
that it contains that you

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.239 align:middle line:90%
might use for these purposes?

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:26.282 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.826 align:middle line:84%
So an example is
cayenne pepper, which

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:84%
is so easy to do as an
example because it's so hot.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.915 align:middle line:84%
There's no denying
the heat of it.

00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:39.462 align:middle line:84%
So if you burnt yourself and
you had a burn on your skin,

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.964 align:middle line:84%
the last thing you would do
is shake some cayenne pepper

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:42.173 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.509 align:middle line:84%
Because you would know that
would sting, and burn, and not

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.301 align:middle line:90%
heal.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:48.137 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, if
you have a lot of burning

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:53.101 align:middle line:84%
pain in your stomach and that
was some of your symptoms,

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:56.229 align:middle line:84%
you probably don't want to
be eating very spicy food

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.981 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
aggravate that condition.

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:01.943 align:middle line:84%
But if you put something
very cool, energetically

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.612 align:middle line:84%
cool into your
digestive system when

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.405 align:middle line:84%
you're having that
burning pain, it's

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:08.282 align:middle line:90%
going to cool your system down.

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So milk, actually, can be very
cooling if you can digest it.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.748 align:middle line:84%
But aloe vera juice,
which is really popular.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:19.585 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of aloe juices out
there now, can be very cooling.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.796 align:middle line:90%
Watermelon is very cooling.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:26.467 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of
how we might use energetics

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:29.637 align:middle line:90%
to actually treat something.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:32.515 align:middle line:84%
And if we had to
pick and choose,

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I would choose the one that was
energetically more appropriate,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:41.149 align:middle line:84%
rather than the one that
was just therapeutically,

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:43.901 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be
what treats your issue.

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.528 align:middle line:84%
But if it's more
cooling, then I'm

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.488 align:middle line:84%
going to choose that
for that person.

00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you give us an
example of small changes

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.827 align:middle line:84%
that someone could
make in their diet that

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:57.373 align:middle line:84%
would have a large impact on
how they metabolize, or digest,

00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:00.877 align:middle line:84%
or something along these lines,
that anyone could safely begin

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.086 align:middle line:90%
doing that would be helpful?

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.213 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So one of the things
I see a lot of, again,

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.756 align:middle line:84%
because we live
here in Colorado,

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.426 align:middle line:84%
is gas, bloating,
and constipation

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:10.678 align:middle line:90%
is such a common symptom.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:15.016 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody is doing a lot
of raw foods, a lot of salads,

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:18.811 align:middle line:84%
I'll just switch them over
to a cooked food diet.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.022 align:middle line:84%
Where they're doing
more soups more

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:24.483 align:middle line:84%
stews, adding a little bit
more moisture into their food.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Warming their food up so that
it's not ice cold right out

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.155 align:middle line:90%
of the refrigerator.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:33.868 align:middle line:84%
And that simple trick of just
eating more warm, cooked food

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.996 align:middle line:84%
can completely take away
the gas, the bloating,

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:41.334 align:middle line:84%
and the constipation
many, many times.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.044 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I have such
a deep appreciation

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:48.341 align:middle line:84%
for such a holistic approach to
anything regarding health care.

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:53.512 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the mind,
body, and spirit components

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.681 align:middle line:90%
are all a part of Ayurveda.

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:57.767 align:middle line:84%
That we're not just talking
about here's your body

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.518 align:middle line:84%
and here's the foods that
you're going to put in it

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.519 align:middle line:90%
and here we go.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:05.191 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to how mind,
body, and spirit are related

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.902 align:middle line:90%
in the digestive complex?

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:08.694 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Absolutely.

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:13.531 align:middle line:84%
So from a Western point of
view, so many people come in

00:17:13.531 --> 00:17:16.786 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
focused on the food.

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:19.914 align:middle line:84%
I'm eating this and I'm getting
sick, or I'm not feeling good,

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:21.415 align:middle line:90%
or these are my symptoms.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:23.667 align:middle line:84%
So there is a physical
component of something

00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:27.088 align:middle line:84%
that might be irritating
or not digesting well.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.215 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the
mental emotional component

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:33.719 align:middle line:84%
that the thought that you
are having around that food

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.139 align:middle line:84%
or when you ate,
your feelings can

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.433 align:middle line:90%
affect how you digest the food.

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
your digestive system

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.354 align:middle line:90%
is a huge nervous system.

00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:46.732 align:middle line:84%
So there's that piece that's,
sort of, the mind body piece,

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.652 align:middle line:84%
the gut brain connection that so
many people are talking about,

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.822 align:middle line:84%
which Ayurveda has
always incorporated

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.907 align:middle line:90%
into how it treats people.

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.118 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
spiritual part, which

00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:01.122 align:middle line:90%
is just so, I think, important.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:04.458 align:middle line:84%
Because food is really about
nurturing and nourishing

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:05.543 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:08.254 align:middle line:84%
And when people start to
have so many digestive issues

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.548 align:middle line:84%
and have so many
issues with food,

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:14.427 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge disconnect
that can happen.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.554 align:middle line:90%
Where more and more food--

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.097 align:middle line:90%
food becomes the bad guy.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:21.475 align:middle line:84%
And I think that would be
an example of how now we're

00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:24.729 align:middle line:84%
getting into an existential
spiritual issue here.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:28.858 align:middle line:84%
You need to nourish your body,
but you think all food is bad.

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.652 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So that conflict alone
can just shut down the system,

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:90%
throw us into fight or flight.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Exactly.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.532 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And nothing's happening
now, except running from bears.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:37.742 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Exactly.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:41.287 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to digest food
if you think it's the bad guy.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.872 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to digest anything

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.083 align:middle line:84%
if you're so worried,
so nervous, so stressed

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:46.959 align:middle line:90%
every time you eat.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.627 align:middle line:84%
That oh, my god,
what's going to happen?

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.796 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to feel bad?

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:56.052 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a huge nervous
system emotional feeling.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.678 align:middle line:84%
There's just a huge
connection there

00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:00.931 align:middle line:84%
that's mind, body,
spirit, in my opinion.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so,
someone has heartburn,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.728 align:middle line:84%
what's the mind,
body, and spirit

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:10.733 align:middle line:84%
approach to some symptom like
that, that seems so commonplace

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:12.693 align:middle line:90%
that Ayurveda would take?

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:15.154 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: An example for
heartburn would be physically,

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.239 align:middle line:90%
we might work on the heat.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:20.076 align:middle line:84%
We say heartburn, again,
that burning sensation

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.577 align:middle line:90%
is a lot of heat in the body.

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:25.289 align:middle line:84%
So on the level of the physical,
we might avoid the spicy foods.

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.583 align:middle line:90%
We might avoid sour foods.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:31.128 align:middle line:84%
Foods that irritate
the physical aspect

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:33.714 align:middle line:84%
of that burning to
heal the physical.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:37.551 align:middle line:84%
Mentally, emotionally,
heartburn can have a lot

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:38.677 align:middle line:90%
to do with the pitta dosha.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.555 align:middle line:84%
It can have a lot to do
with anger, frustration,

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:42.723 align:middle line:90%
irritability--

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.559 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those emotions,
a lot of the type

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:48.729 align:middle line:84%
A behavior that goes
along with pitta.

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:54.151 align:middle line:84%
So being able to calm the
brain down and get people

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.196 align:middle line:84%
to be cooler from a mental
health point of view,

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.907 align:middle line:84%
a little more
diffuse, not so type A

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:02.493 align:middle line:90%
can really help with heartburn.

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:06.414 align:middle line:84%
And then from a spiritual
level, again, energetically, we

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:11.544 align:middle line:84%
say that the vata scatters,
but that it pulls things up.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:14.797 align:middle line:84%
So it's pulling a lot of
heat in an upward direction.

00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So when the vata pushes the
pitta in an upward direction,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.469 align:middle line:90%
that's an energetic imbalance.

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's various things
we would do in Ayurveda

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.975 align:middle line:84%
to help balance that back down
and get the energies to come

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.184 align:middle line:90%
back into balance.

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.686 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: One example.

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:29.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Of the vata--

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Of what you
would do right there.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.692 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So that's
where the way you eat

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.695 align:middle line:84%
would actually be a vata
pitta balancing diet.

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:41.907 align:middle line:84%
So I would want you to eat
warm, cooked, moist foods.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.869 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I would
make sure that nothing you eat

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:48.873 align:middle line:90%
is spicy, hot, sour, acidic.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:53.502 align:middle line:84%
And so the combination
of very specific diet.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.421 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases
like that, we would

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:58.716 align:middle line:84%
be very specific about your diet
for a certain period of time,

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.385 align:middle line:84%
six to eight weeks, to get
the energies to come down.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:04.096 align:middle line:84%
We might add the oil
massages for the vata--

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.599 align:middle line:84%
which you talked about
a lot, which actually

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:09.393 align:middle line:84%
take that scattered energy and
bring it back to the center

00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
and ground you.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.983 align:middle line:84%
So we might do some lifestyle
things, like the oil massage.

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.403 align:middle line:84%
We might take afternoon
naps because maybe, there's

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.697 align:middle line:84%
a fatigue factor going on
and the heartburn's only

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:90%
happening at night.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.492 align:middle line:84%
And you're stressing
your system out

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and there's a stress
component here.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.622 align:middle line:84%
So then maybe between
2:00 to 4:00, which we say

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.540 align:middle line:84%
is the adrenal time
of the day, maybe

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.292 align:middle line:90%
you would rest a little bit.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:37.671 align:middle line:84%
Take even a 10-minute
break to allow yourself

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:41.217 align:middle line:84%
to recover and let
the adrenals come back

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.302 align:middle line:90%
to a nice, healthy place.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.303 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: To kind of reset.

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:45.846 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Reset themselves, yeah.

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:47.264 align:middle line:84%
So there's so many
things I would

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:50.935 align:middle line:84%
do that are not just
conventional ways of treating

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:51.727 align:middle line:90%
heartburn.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.854 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Take a Tums.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:55.397 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
taking Tums every day

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:57.983 align:middle line:84%
and wondering why you're
not feeling so well.

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.694 align:middle line:84%
And wondering why other
things are starting to happen.

00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:03.113 align:middle line:84%
And it's all because the
system is just out of balance.

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Just bring the
system into balance.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.827 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: And there's a great
example that I have of a woman

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:10.329 align:middle line:84%
that I worked with
for many years

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and we got her almost completely
free of her heartburn.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.294 align:middle line:84%
She was on a great
diet, great lifestyle.

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:20.047 align:middle line:84%
Every once in a while,
twice a week or so,

00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:21.215 align:middle line:90%
she would get her heartburn.

00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:24.802 align:middle line:84%
And we just couldn't
figure out what it was.

00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:27.763 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her to stop running
because she was a runner

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:29.515 align:middle line:90%
and she was very vata.

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And vata people
shouldn't really run.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.228 align:middle line:84%
It's a very vata
aggravating sport.

00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:37.231 align:middle line:84%
And she realized that every
time she ran, she got heartburn.

00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:38.065 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interesting.

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:40.859 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So that energetic
thing of running,

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:44.071 align:middle line:84%
which was aggravating her vata,
was causing the heartburn.

00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:45.406 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Even though she loved it.

00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:46.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Even though
she loved it.

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:46.907 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It wasn't
working for her.

00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:47.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: It wasn't working.

00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:49.785 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what would you
suggest that she do, instead?

00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:52.079 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Walking, swimming, yoga.

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:54.915 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's a little more
rhythmic, a little more vata

00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:56.375 align:middle line:90%
pacifying.

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:59.253 align:middle line:84%
Something that's more
grounding, more nurturing.

00:22:59.253 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So all of the graceful
sort of sports.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.427 align:middle line:84%
Dance, if it's a real
graceful type of dance.

00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:09.471 align:middle line:84%
Even just going on elliptical,
where you're not really running

00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:11.974 align:middle line:90%
and getting that high impact.

00:23:11.974 --> 00:23:14.643 align:middle line:84%
Just doing elliptical
machine might

00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:17.855 align:middle line:84%
help if it's done in
a very rhythmic way.

00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:20.357 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Especially being outside
in the elements and the wind

00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:22.776 align:middle line:84%
and all that is
even aggravating.

00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:24.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: It might be
aggravating even further--

00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:26.196 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:27.615 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Very interesting.

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:30.534 align:middle line:84%
So what about these
digestive symptoms,

00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:33.954 align:middle line:84%
are they the telltale sign
that something more significant

00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:34.747 align:middle line:90%
is going on?

00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:39.001 align:middle line:84%
Or are we able to really
catch these things

00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:41.253 align:middle line:84%
when they're just an
introductory symptom that's

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:42.046 align:middle line:90%
revealing?

00:23:42.046 --> 00:23:43.505 align:middle line:84%
Is there concern
that people should

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.424 align:middle line:84%
have one when they're
having these symptoms,

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:48.302 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
serious behind the scenes?

00:23:48.302 --> 00:23:49.887 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: There's not
always something

00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:51.221 align:middle line:90%
serious behind the scenes.

00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:53.641 align:middle line:84%
But our philosophy
in Ayurveda is

00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:55.934 align:middle line:84%
that some of these
digestive issues

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:59.521 align:middle line:84%
are the beginnings of
things going out of balance.

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And that if we let them continue
to be out of balance, that's

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:84%
when 20 or 30 years later,
people come to you and say,

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.405 align:middle line:84%
I got cancer and I
have no idea why.

00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:11.533 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you trace
someone's history back,

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:14.662 align:middle line:84%
you might see that there
were these symptoms of things

00:24:14.662 --> 00:24:16.747 align:middle line:90%
going out of balance.

00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Constipation, or gas, or
bloating, or whether it's

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.043 align:middle line:90%
heartburn.

00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:22.961 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is,
that digestively,

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.755 align:middle line:90%
they were having issues.

00:24:24.755 --> 00:24:27.591 align:middle line:84%
But they just chose to
ignore it or they didn't

00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:28.801 align:middle line:90%
realize that was an issue.

00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:32.054 align:middle line:84%
Or like me, when I was just
doing regular old family

00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:35.015 align:middle line:84%
practice, I didn't really
have any good solutions

00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:38.602 align:middle line:84%
to offer people of how
to permanently really fix

00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:40.479 align:middle line:84%
the core imbalance,
not just medicate

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:42.398 align:middle line:90%
it to get the symptoms away.

00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:45.818 align:middle line:84%
Like Tums or some
heartburn medicine.

00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:48.112 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's such a shortcoming
in Western medicine

00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:51.657 align:middle line:84%
and the general approach that
has been symptom-related,

00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
treating the symptom instead of
generating balance in the body.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.831 align:middle line:84%
And I know that our viewers
are very interested in hey,

00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
give us the information that
allows us to take charge,

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.462 align:middle line:84%
to really be in charge of
creating the level of health

00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:06.964 align:middle line:90%
and vitality that we want.

00:25:06.964 --> 00:25:09.049 align:middle line:84%
So that we're not just
waiting for the other shoe

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:11.468 align:middle line:84%
to fall until something
more significant happens.

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:14.972 align:middle line:84%
And we end up having to go
into that system of medicating,

00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:84%
or surgeries, or
these kinds of things.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.768 align:middle line:84%
That we're preempting all that
by living in this balance.

00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:21.854 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: And that's where
Ayurveda is so beautiful.

00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:24.773 align:middle line:84%
Because it is such a great
preventative science.

00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:26.066 align:middle line:90%
It's so much about--

00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:29.653 align:middle line:84%
I tell my patients, it's like
when you're by a computer,

00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:30.946 align:middle line:90%
it comes with a manual.

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:33.574 align:middle line:84%
Well, Ayurveda is like
your user's manual.

00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:35.951 align:middle line:84%
Once you know what body
type you are and you

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:38.328 align:middle line:84%
learn how to take care
of that body type,

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:39.288 align:middle line:90%
you have your manual.

00:25:39.288 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to know how
to take care of yourself.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.127 align:middle line:84%
And it's very preventative
to prevent further problems.

00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:46.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And it
allows us to thrive,

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:49.089 align:middle line:84%
instead of just
trying to get by.

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:53.719 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that plagues
our Western world is fatigue.

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:55.429 align:middle line:84%
And lots of
approaches to fatigue

00:25:55.429 --> 00:25:59.224 align:middle line:84%
have shown up as on every street
corner, the coffee shop trying

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:01.894 align:middle line:90%
to overcome the fatigue.

00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:04.229 align:middle line:84%
And some smarter
approaches, of course,

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
are available in all kinds
of health approaches.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.611 align:middle line:84%
And I know that integrative
medicine has their approach

00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:12.696 align:middle line:84%
and naturopathy would
have its approach.

00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:16.575 align:middle line:84%
And how would Ayurveda
address fatigue differently

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
than some of the
other disciplines?

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.248 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Again, we look at the
energetics behind it, as well.

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:27.461 align:middle line:84%
While in the Western
realm, a lot of times,

00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:29.546 align:middle line:90%
things go through fads.

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:33.008 align:middle line:84%
First, people who had a
lot of fatigue had Candida

00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:34.885 align:middle line:90%
and nowadays, they have Lyme.

00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:37.638 align:middle line:84%
And there's always some
new kid on the block.

00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:39.389 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're singing
my song, like,

00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:40.974 align:middle line:90%
what's the disease du jour?

00:26:40.974 --> 00:26:42.518 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: The disease
of the day that's

00:26:42.518 --> 00:26:45.521 align:middle line:84%
causing all your problems
and that's why you're tired.

00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So we look actually
at the person

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.775 align:middle line:90%
and their core imbalances.

00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:53.028 align:middle line:90%
What's going on inside of you?

00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:54.571 align:middle line:90%
What is out of balance?

00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.032 align:middle line:90%
How can I fix that?

00:26:57.032 --> 00:26:59.284 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you're
being affected, maybe,

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:01.662 align:middle line:84%
by the Lyme, or the
Candida, or whatever it is.

00:27:01.662 --> 00:27:03.664 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that is
affecting you, but it's

00:27:03.664 --> 00:27:06.208 align:middle line:84%
because your immune
system is out of balance.

00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:11.672 align:middle line:84%
It's because your adrenals, the
core vitality, what do they do?

00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:14.216 align:middle line:84%
Adrenals are all
about homeostasis.

00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:15.676 align:middle line:90%
They're all about balance.

00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:17.052 align:middle line:90%
They affect your immune system.

00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:18.887 align:middle line:84%
They affect your
ability to have energy.

00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:21.223 align:middle line:84%
They affect your
blood sugar balance.

00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:22.474 align:middle line:90%
And all of this is related.

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:24.101 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with
somebody, I want

00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:25.894 align:middle line:90%
to work with the whole system.

00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It's really a comprehensive
plan that I have with people.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.319 align:middle line:84%
And I basically, tell them,
and we do have little groups

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.447 align:middle line:84%
that we do a little
teaching around,

00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:40.742 align:middle line:84%
where you really have to have
a lifestyle to get better.

00:27:40.742 --> 00:27:43.662 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
about one thing.

00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:46.498 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole
lifestyle that helps.

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:48.458 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: One of the things
people are recognizing

00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:50.419 align:middle line:84%
that adrenal fatigue
is a real issue with me

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:52.504 align:middle line:84%
and how do I treat
the adrenal fatigue.

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.172 align:middle line:84%
But I'm interested
in the question,

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:56.425 align:middle line:84%
also, where does adrenal
fatigue come from?

00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:57.968 align:middle line:84%
So what would
Ayurveda have to say

00:27:57.968 --> 00:28:01.305 align:middle line:84%
about the cause of
adrenal fatigue,

00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:03.015 align:middle line:90%
regarding the doshas, et cetera?

00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:05.392 align:middle line:10%
>>NITA: So from an
Ayurvedic point of view,

00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:10.564 align:middle line:10%
severe adrenal fatigue, we call
it a severe vata imbalance.

00:28:10.564 --> 00:28:15.152 align:middle line:10%
It's when you've let that vata
dosha get so out of control, so

00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:16.278 align:middle line:10%
out of balance.

00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:19.114 align:middle line:84%
Where the energy of the
nervous system and then the

00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:21.366 align:middle line:84%
nervous system controls
the endocrine system--

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:25.746 align:middle line:84%
everything has become so
scattered and so diffuse,

00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:30.459 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, that how can you,
if you even thought about it,

00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:32.753 align:middle line:84%
how could you have any energy
when everything is just

00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:90%
scattering out?

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.633 align:middle line:84%
And so it's about
collecting all of that

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:40.594 align:middle line:84%
and bring it back to
center and grounding it.

00:28:40.594 --> 00:28:43.096 align:middle line:84%
And so we say that
adrenal fatigue

00:28:43.096 --> 00:28:46.892 align:middle line:84%
is about that scattered
nervous system energy.

00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:51.438 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with you, people
get stuck in different phases,

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:54.107 align:middle line:84%
depending on their body
type, their constitution,

00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:90%
how they view things.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.736 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, it has to
do with their perceptions.

00:28:57.736 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Creating
bears all the time.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Stress is-- everything's
out to get me.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.866 align:middle line:90%
I'm never safe.

00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:84%
That is constantly sending
that message to the body.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And the adrenal fatigue
and then the thyroid

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.165 align:middle line:84%
gets affected by
the adrenal fatigue.

00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:12.584 align:middle line:84%
And you work with
the thyroid disorder

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.836 align:middle line:84%
so speak to us about
your approach there.

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:17.381 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that it's
progressed to the degree

00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:20.717 align:middle line:84%
that someone now has a thyroid
condition, what do you do?

00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:22.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So I work
with, again, looking

00:29:22.636 --> 00:29:24.346 align:middle line:84%
at all of the endocrine
system because I

00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:27.432 align:middle line:84%
feel like the whole endocrine
system is a big system.

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:30.185 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that nervous system,
and the endocrine system,

00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:32.604 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system,
everything talks.

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.523 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of times,
thyroid function

00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:37.192 align:middle line:84%
will go down not just because
your thyroid is having

00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:40.487 align:middle line:84%
a problem, but many times,
it's because you just

00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:41.530 align:middle line:90%
don't have enough energy.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not supporting
yourself well enough.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.368 align:middle line:84%
And now your adrenals are
telling the thyroid, hey,

00:29:46.368 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:90%
bud, you have no energy.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.914 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep metabolizing
at this normal rate.

00:29:50.914 --> 00:29:53.041 align:middle line:84%
We're going to lower
your metabolism.

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:55.335 align:middle line:84%
So the thyroid is
actually down regulating.

00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:57.963 align:middle line:84%
And you want to know that
because just giving someone

00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:01.174 align:middle line:84%
thyroid hormone and up
regulating them back might not

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.343 align:middle line:90%
solve the problem.

00:30:03.343 --> 00:30:06.096 align:middle line:84%
There might be a temporary
spurt of energy, again.

00:30:06.096 --> 00:30:08.515 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, they're
going to burn out, again.

00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:09.891 align:middle line:84%
And so working
with the adrenals,

00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:11.893 align:middle line:84%
working with the thyroid
around menopause.

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:16.189 align:middle line:84%
The ovaries get involved there
with estrogen and progesterone.

00:30:16.189 --> 00:30:17.983 align:middle line:90%
There's so many cascades.

00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:20.444 align:middle line:84%
So again, Ayurveda is
all about the balance

00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:21.945 align:middle line:90%
between all of these things.

00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:23.447 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So there's
another thing that

00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:28.535 align:middle line:84%
is a common question about
seasonal affective disorder

00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:33.206 align:middle line:84%
and what does Ayurveda
have to say about this?

00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:36.376 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Again, we work so
much with things seasonally

00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:39.838 align:middle line:84%
and as the fall and
the winter comes on,

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:43.467 align:middle line:84%
we say that's a vata
time of the year.

00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:45.844 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll notice I
use that word vata a lot.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:49.306 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the vata, we say
is 80% responsible for almost

00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:50.807 align:middle line:90%
all diseases.

00:30:50.807 --> 00:30:54.019 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
change and the body

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:56.354 align:middle line:84%
is not able to
adapt to that change

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:59.024 align:middle line:84%
because the vata is getting
more and more scattered,

00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:02.569 align:middle line:84%
we say that that is how
the seasonal affective

00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:03.820 align:middle line:90%
disorder comes about.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.948 align:middle line:84%
So it is a vata type
of an imbalance.

00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:09.576 align:middle line:84%
Having routines, waking
up at the same time,

00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:13.371 align:middle line:84%
going to bed at the same time,
eating your meals on time

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:15.415 align:middle line:90%
really does help it a lot.

00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:18.502 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's, as we know
from a Western point of view,

00:31:18.502 --> 00:31:22.255 align:middle line:84%
the light-dark
transition and being

00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:27.719 align:middle line:84%
able to adapt to the shorter
days is a huge aspect of it.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.847 align:middle line:84%
So because I'm an
East-West practitioner,

00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:32.641 align:middle line:90%
I do a little bit of both.

00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:35.268 align:middle line:84%
So I use light visors
because they're

00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:37.437 align:middle line:84%
nice that you can
just put it right on.

00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:39.648 align:middle line:84%
It's like a little cap
and you turn the light on.

00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:41.358 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you open
your eyes in the morning,

00:31:41.358 --> 00:31:42.234 align:middle line:90%
you stick that on.

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell people
to start September 1.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.365 align:middle line:84%
And you wear it every single
day for 30 to 45 minutes

00:31:48.365 --> 00:31:49.157 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:31:49.157 --> 00:31:51.076 align:middle line:84%
And you can do anything you
want to, other than jump

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:51.868 align:middle line:90%
in the shower.

00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:53.703 align:middle line:84%
You can brush your
teeth with it on.

00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:55.205 align:middle line:90%
Drive your car to work.

00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:90%
And it works like a charm.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.543 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So it's bringing light.

00:31:59.543 --> 00:32:02.963 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: It's bringing some
light into the back of the--

00:32:02.963 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:90%
full spectrum light.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.382 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Helping the
circadian system.

00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:08.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Helping that helping
to reset your circadian rhythm.

00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing
it every single day

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.850 align:middle line:84%
like a routine, in a rhythm,
first thing in the morning.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.768 align:middle line:84%
You're keeping
that rhythm going.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.229 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: There's also kind
of a spiritual component

00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:22.232 align:middle line:84%
when we're having
these systems and we're

00:32:22.232 --> 00:32:25.652 align:middle line:84%
becoming devoted to a
rhythm, and a cycle,

00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:27.195 align:middle line:90%
and having some regularity.

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:31.575 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of this
caretaking idea that I matter.

00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:34.911 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to set this
out as a system for myself.

00:32:34.911 --> 00:32:36.705 align:middle line:84%
And I matter enough
that I'm going to stick

00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:38.832 align:middle line:90%
to this kind of rhythm.

00:32:38.832 --> 00:32:40.792 align:middle line:84%
And so the spiritual
component kind of

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:43.795 align:middle line:84%
comes in as a self-care
kind of element

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.755 align:middle line:84%
all at the same time
that we're working

00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:48.717 align:middle line:84%
with these physical
elements, as well.

00:32:48.717 --> 00:32:49.759 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Yes, absolutely.

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:52.929 align:middle line:84%
So self-care is so
much part of Ayurveda.

00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:55.849 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much part of
the nurturing of the body

00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:57.017 align:middle line:90%
is the self-care.

00:32:57.017 --> 00:33:00.854 align:middle line:84%
And the listening to the
body, which, I think, we

00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:02.689 align:middle line:90%
have forgotten to do is listen.

00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:05.233 align:middle line:84%
Our body is actually
talking to us.

00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:07.903 align:middle line:84%
When we are in pain, it's not
just because the body feels

00:33:07.903 --> 00:33:09.487 align:middle line:90%
like making our life horrible.

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Miserable.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.114 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Miserable.

00:33:11.114 --> 00:33:11.489 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's not against us.

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:12.282 align:middle line:90%
It's not the enemy.

00:33:12.282 --> 00:33:14.242 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Yeah, it's
telling us, it's a signal.

00:33:14.242 --> 00:33:15.827 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's like
hey, pay attention.

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.329 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Yeah, something's wrong.

00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:20.707 align:middle line:84%
If we're tired, it's our
body signaling us saying

00:33:20.707 --> 00:33:21.999 align:middle line:90%
something's not right here.

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:24.127 align:middle line:90%
I don't have enough energy.

00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:27.255 align:middle line:84%
And so to look at those
signals and to listen to them,

00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:30.592 align:middle line:84%
I think are really the
key that people sometimes

00:33:30.592 --> 00:33:31.843 align:middle line:90%
miss completely.

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:34.471 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Learning to speak the
languages of the body, body

00:33:34.471 --> 00:33:35.555 align:middle line:90%
talk.

00:33:35.555 --> 00:33:38.058 align:middle line:84%
And I know as an
Ayurvedic practitioner,

00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:41.436 align:middle line:84%
you are also learning
the languages of the body

00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're reading
these languages.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.399 align:middle line:84%
You develop certain skills
to be able to give someone

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.443 align:middle line:84%
the feedback about
their doshas, et cetera.

00:33:48.443 --> 00:33:50.946 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak about
the skills that you

00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:53.949 align:middle line:90%
use in your diagnostic process?

00:33:53.949 --> 00:33:56.201 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Yeah, the
Ayurvedic diagnosis

00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:59.454 align:middle line:90%
has been around for 5,000 years.

00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:01.039 align:middle line:90%
We use face diagnosis.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.958 align:middle line:90%
We look for things in the face.

00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:06.086 align:middle line:84%
We look at the tongue,
various things that

00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:07.420 align:middle line:90%
are going on with your tongue.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.047 align:middle line:90%
We look at nails.

00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.465 align:middle line:90%
We feel pulses.

00:34:10.465 --> 00:34:14.302 align:middle line:84%
And that constitution
that I talked

00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:18.473 align:middle line:84%
about in earlier, that's
usually done by pulse diagnosis.

00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:20.725 align:middle line:84%
So we feel what that
constitution that you

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:22.435 align:middle line:90%
came into this world is.

00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:24.478 align:middle line:84%
And then we feel what's
gone out of balance.

00:34:24.478 --> 00:34:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's two separate
types of pulses

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.065 align:middle line:90%
there that we're feeling.

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But within that world of pulses,
we can feel organ pulses.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.156 align:middle line:84%
We can feel many
different things

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:36.616 align:middle line:90%
that's going on in the body.

00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:38.827 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And this is a
fascinating thing that, I think,

00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:42.831 align:middle line:84%
our viewers are wanting
to hear more about.

00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:47.752 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda is this beautiful
sophisticated approach

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:51.047 align:middle line:84%
to recognizing there are
multiple pulses in the body.

00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:53.675 align:middle line:84%
And that each pulse
is revealing something

00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:56.511 align:middle line:84%
about these various
systems of the body.

00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:59.014 align:middle line:84%
Different organs, and glands,
and systems that work together

00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:01.057 align:middle line:84%
have their own
frequency energetically.

00:35:01.057 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can pick up on that
with a different pulse.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.105 align:middle line:84%
And so can you share any
more about that, that might

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:08.565 align:middle line:90%
be of interest for everyone?

00:35:08.565 --> 00:35:11.026 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Yeah, it's an
art and it's a science.

00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:12.485 align:middle line:90%
I think, it's both.

00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:14.654 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
some technical aspects

00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:19.034 align:middle line:84%
where you have to learn
how to do pulse diagnosis.

00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:22.203 align:middle line:84%
So technically, you need to
know where to put your fingers.

00:35:22.203 --> 00:35:23.413 align:middle line:90%
How deep to feel.

00:35:23.413 --> 00:35:25.457 align:middle line:84%
All of these little
bits like that.

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:27.500 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
an intuitive piece.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.421 align:middle line:84%
There's an art, as well, where
you're listening into the body.

00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:35.425 align:middle line:84%
And where you're trying
to-- what information

00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:38.136 align:middle line:84%
you want to get, you have
to be receptive to it.

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:41.598 align:middle line:84%
So it's a balance between
an art and a science,

00:35:41.598 --> 00:35:44.726 align:middle line:84%
between an intuitive
and a technical aspect.

00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But with Ayurveda, when
we feel the pulses,

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.022 align:middle line:84%
we're feeling deep
pulses sometimes.

00:35:49.022 --> 00:35:51.274 align:middle line:84%
We're feeling more
superficial pulses.

00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:53.860 align:middle line:84%
We have seven layers
of pulses, depending

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.279 align:middle line:90%
on how hard you press down.

00:35:56.279 --> 00:36:00.075 align:middle line:84%
And within those layers,
we can feel pulses

00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:02.285 align:middle line:90%
as thready and very weak.

00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:06.873 align:middle line:84%
Or we can feel pulses that
are jumping like frogs at us.

00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:13.546 align:middle line:84%
Or we can feel pulses that are
more graceful and swan-like.

00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:16.049 align:middle line:84%
And so we're actually
looking at the rhythm.

00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:19.302 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at how it
comes up to meet our fingers.

00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:25.225 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a thready
or a frog-like meeting.

00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:26.935 align:middle line:90%
There's so many nuances to it.

00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:27.811 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: How beautiful.

00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:31.147 align:middle line:84%
And each of these is revealing
something different about how

00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:32.857 align:middle line:90%
the body is operating.

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:35.151 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in natural
health care environment.

00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:38.196 align:middle line:84%
I've never gone to the
doctor to take an antibiotic

00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:41.116 align:middle line:90%
to relieve some symptom.

00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:42.867 align:middle line:84%
And so I have this
great appreciation

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:45.245 align:middle line:84%
for what the body is
constantly revealing.

00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:47.205 align:middle line:84%
And the world of
bioenergetics where

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.707 align:middle line:84%
we're matching
pulses and getting

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:53.795 align:middle line:84%
them to synchronize in a
little bit different approach.

00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:56.756 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that
we are energy beings.

00:36:56.756 --> 00:37:02.053 align:middle line:84%
And we have to learn to sense
and feel into energies in order

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:05.056 align:middle line:84%
to maintain our true
vital force in the world.

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:10.228 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything along the
lines of pulse diagnosis-- now,

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.813 align:middle line:84%
not reading someone
else's pulse--

00:37:11.813 --> 00:37:15.859 align:middle line:84%
but that a person could sit
and sense about themselves?

00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:19.028 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of self-diagnostic
approach in Ayurveda?

00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:21.489 align:middle line:84%
Or is it, pretty much,
something that someone else

00:37:21.489 --> 00:37:23.533 align:middle line:84%
has to do the reading
and interview.

00:37:23.533 --> 00:37:26.786 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: No, there's obviously,
there's many books on Ayurveda.

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:29.998 align:middle line:84%
And almost all of them
will have a questionnaire.

00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:31.207 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: A questionnaire there.

00:37:31.207 --> 00:37:32.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: And you can definitely--

00:37:32.542 --> 00:37:34.836 align:middle line:84%
I usually tell people,
do the questionnaire

00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:37.464 align:middle line:84%
trying to remember what
you were like as a child.

00:37:37.464 --> 00:37:40.175 align:middle line:84%
Because most likely, you
were the most healthy

00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:41.718 align:middle line:90%
as a young person or a child.

00:37:41.718 --> 00:37:43.803 align:middle line:84%
And that might give
you your constitution.

00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:47.098 align:middle line:84%
And then do the questionnaire
of how you're feeling now.

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:48.808 align:middle line:84%
And that will give
you your imbalance.

00:37:48.808 --> 00:37:52.228 align:middle line:84%
And so then you'll have a sense
of this must be my constitution

00:37:52.228 --> 00:37:54.063 align:middle line:90%
and this must be my imbalance.

00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:56.941 align:middle line:84%
But as you learn more
about the different doshas

00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.278 align:middle line:84%
and the characteristics,
if you tune into that,

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:03.031 align:middle line:84%
you're going to know
what's out of balance.

00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:05.074 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much you
can do to self-heal, just

00:38:05.074 --> 00:38:06.951 align:middle line:90%
by thinking of qualities.

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.661 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, hot and cold.

00:38:08.661 --> 00:38:13.875 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes say, there's
20 attributes or qualities that

00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:16.794 align:middle line:90%
are opposite pairs in Ayurveda.

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:21.049 align:middle line:84%
And just by using those
alone, you can heal yourself.

00:38:21.049 --> 00:38:24.511 align:middle line:84%
So if something
is cold, then you

00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:26.596 align:middle line:90%
want to apply some heat to it.

00:38:26.596 --> 00:38:28.973 align:middle line:84%
If something is
dry, then you want

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.392 align:middle line:84%
to apply something
that's moist to it.

00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And just by using
those attributes alone,

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.482 align:middle line:84%
you could do so much
to heal yourself.

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:41.444 align:middle line:84%
By just sitting there
going inside, saying what

00:38:41.444 --> 00:38:42.737 align:middle line:90%
are the attributes?

00:38:42.737 --> 00:38:43.947 align:middle line:90%
What is it about it?

00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:48.535 align:middle line:84%
Well, my skin is really
dry and it's really rough.

00:38:48.535 --> 00:38:51.496 align:middle line:84%
OK, so maybe it need something
nice and moist on it.

00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:56.668 align:middle line:84%
That would be a very
simple example of something

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:57.585 align:middle line:90%
you could do yourself.

00:38:57.585 --> 00:38:59.128 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We get the
gist of it, though.

00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:02.006 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
is bringing a harmony

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:05.009 align:middle line:84%
by applying, or taking,
or eating differently

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.428 align:middle line:84%
in accordance with what
we're sensing and perceiving

00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:84%
or that the doshas
are showing us.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.017 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
bring that harmony,

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:15.311 align:middle line:84%
the body knows what
to do to heal itself.

00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:17.355 align:middle line:84%
So we're not trying
to heal ourselves,

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:20.942 align:middle line:84%
we're bringing things together
to create the environment where

00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:23.278 align:middle line:84%
healing can
automatically take place.

00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:24.904 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Healing
happens spontaneously.

00:39:24.904 --> 00:39:25.697 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:27.949 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: You're just balancing
the energetics of it

00:39:27.949 --> 00:39:30.451 align:middle line:84%
so that you're putting
yourself in the right place.

00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:31.786 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And it's meant to be.

00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:33.079 align:middle line:90%
We're meant to be self-healing.

00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:37.125 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is something
that we can't hear it enough.

00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:41.129 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been inundated
and trained up to believe that

00:39:41.129 --> 00:39:43.840 align:middle line:84%
the healing comes from over
there, from the outside,

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.217 align:middle line:90%
from a bottle or from something.

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:49.137 align:middle line:84%
And healing happens in the body,
that's where healing happens.

00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:50.847 align:middle line:84%
But we can do some
things that will

00:39:50.847 --> 00:39:53.725 align:middle line:84%
allow the perfect environment
for that healing to take place.

00:39:53.725 --> 00:39:55.727 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you're
providing for people.

00:39:55.727 --> 00:39:57.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: And this is
where sometimes when

00:39:57.395 --> 00:40:00.273 align:middle line:84%
people get overwhelmed and
they feel like they just

00:40:00.273 --> 00:40:04.652 align:middle line:84%
don't have time, this is where
the intuitive piece comes in.

00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:08.448 align:middle line:84%
This is where if you have
done the spiritual work

00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:11.909 align:middle line:84%
and you know how to go to that
center, that core of yourself,

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:16.039 align:middle line:84%
if you know where to
find that quiet space,

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:18.541 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
a place of refuge,

00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:21.210 align:middle line:90%
a place to reset and rebalance.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.339 align:middle line:84%
And that alone can have
such a tremendous effect

00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:25.965 align:middle line:90%
on health and healing.

00:40:25.965 --> 00:40:28.551 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what's
just missing from the West.

00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:31.179 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
that piece.

00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:35.224 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really understand
what meditation or what

00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:36.559 align:middle line:90%
any of that really means.

00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:38.186 align:middle line:90%
It's just all kind of mumbly.

00:40:38.186 --> 00:40:40.229 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:40.897 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: They might
seek meditation

00:40:40.897 --> 00:40:42.565 align:middle line:84%
for stress management,
but it's not

00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:46.194 align:middle line:84%
about cultivating the healing
presence within the system

00:40:46.194 --> 00:40:47.236 align:middle line:90%
as a way of living.

00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:49.197 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Learning that
you and inside of you

00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:53.826 align:middle line:84%
is an incredible presence and
an incredible healing potential.

00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:59.874 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn how to find
that place within yourself

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:00.958 align:middle line:90%
anything is possible.

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:02.919 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That we really
are that healing presence

00:41:02.919 --> 00:41:06.089 align:middle line:84%
and we have to train our
mind to come onto us.

00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:08.007 align:middle line:84%
That's how much of
a healer we are.

00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:09.384 align:middle line:84%
That's how much
of a self-healer.

00:41:09.384 --> 00:41:12.136 align:middle line:84%
We are the healer, but
our mind is so scattered

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:15.014 align:middle line:84%
and it's not on
us as the healer,

00:41:15.014 --> 00:41:16.766 align:middle line:84%
to allow that healing
to take place.

00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:20.978 align:middle line:84%
And so by doing these practices
and by bringing these materials

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:23.690 align:middle line:84%
in together and quickening
ourselves in the way

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:26.484 align:middle line:84%
that you're describing for
vata, in particular, it

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:29.654 align:middle line:84%
allows that presence
to do its thing.

00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:33.074 align:middle line:84%
And we get out of
the way with it.

00:41:33.074 --> 00:41:35.702 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned
facial, and pulses,

00:41:35.702 --> 00:41:37.870 align:middle line:90%
and also looking at the tongue.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.164 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you're
looking for with the tongue?

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:42.333 align:middle line:84%
I know lots of people are
always curious about that.

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.793 align:middle line:84%
So can you just
share that with us?

00:41:43.793 --> 00:41:46.713 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So in the tongue, we're
looking to see if it's coated.

00:41:46.713 --> 00:41:48.923 align:middle line:84%
If it is coated, what part
of the tongue is coated

00:41:48.923 --> 00:41:52.260 align:middle line:84%
will tell us which organ system
might have a lot of toxins.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.888 align:middle line:84%
So tongue coating is
usually related to toxins.

00:41:55.888 --> 00:41:57.807 align:middle line:84%
The color of the
coating can give us

00:41:57.807 --> 00:42:01.352 align:middle line:84%
an indication if its'
kapha-type of toxins or pitta.

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So yellowish color
might be a pitta toxin.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.858 align:middle line:84%
Very white might
be a kapha toxin.

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:08.693 align:middle line:84%
Where it's located,
if it's all the way

00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:12.655 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the tongue,
that relates to the colon.

00:42:12.655 --> 00:42:15.533 align:middle line:84%
So just like a
little homunculus,

00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:19.036 align:middle line:84%
we have a little version
of ourselves on our tongue.

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.663 align:middle line:84%
So we know where
all the organs are

00:42:20.663 --> 00:42:23.166 align:middle line:84%
and we can tell where
something is out of balance.

00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:26.043 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Kind of reflexology,
but also on the tongue.

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.837 align:middle line:90%
It's just the tongue's version.

00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:30.757 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: We look
at teeth marks yes

00:42:30.757 --> 00:42:32.842 align:middle line:84%
and that tells us
about malabsorption

00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:35.803 align:middle line:84%
and how you're doing with
hydration, malabsorption,

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:39.056 align:middle line:84%
digestion, assimilation--
a lot of things like that.

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:40.099 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:44.771 align:middle line:84%
So we're referencing spirit
in parts of our conversation.

00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:49.609 align:middle line:84%
And I just love for you
to come back onto that

00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:53.029 align:middle line:84%
and give people an
understanding about what

00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:58.951 align:middle line:84%
this spiritual component is to
healing, regarding Ayurveda.

00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:00.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So in
Ayurveda, we really

00:43:00.495 --> 00:43:04.373 align:middle line:84%
feel that if you don't
take care of the spirit,

00:43:04.373 --> 00:43:06.501 align:middle line:84%
you really aren't
a healthy person.

00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:09.587 align:middle line:84%
So an example would be
maybe an elite athlete

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:84%
who Western medicine might
look at that elite athlete

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.384 align:middle line:84%
and say, wow, that's as
healthy as you can get.

00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:20.723 align:middle line:84%
They might be physically in
incredible shape, very healthy.

00:43:20.723 --> 00:43:23.017 align:middle line:84%
They might be eating
the right nutrients.

00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:25.228 align:middle line:84%
But if mentally,
emotionally, they're

00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:28.356 align:middle line:84%
extremely self-critical,
extremely type A,

00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:31.400 align:middle line:84%
never satisfied with
how well they do,

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.612 align:middle line:84%
we would say that there's
a mental emotional.

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.239 align:middle line:84%
We would not
consider that person

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:39.200 align:middle line:90%
to be in harmony or in health.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.869 align:middle line:84%
So we say that health
is about balance.

00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:43.996 align:middle line:84%
The physical has
to be in balance.

00:43:43.996 --> 00:43:47.083 align:middle line:84%
The mental emotional piece
has to be in balance.

00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So there can't be that
self-critical, self-judgmental

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.754 align:middle line:90%
piece in there.

00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:56.259 align:middle line:84%
And then there has to be
this spiritual place where

00:43:56.259 --> 00:43:59.929 align:middle line:84%
there's a sense of
contentment, which

00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:04.517 align:middle line:90%
I've alluded to a little bit.

00:44:04.517 --> 00:44:08.688 align:middle line:84%
There has to be some
spiritual contentment--

00:44:08.688 --> 00:44:12.149 align:middle line:84%
is the only word I can
think of right now.

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:15.945 align:middle line:84%
And that all three of
those have to be layered on

00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:18.656 align:middle line:84%
and lined up for people
to be truly happy.

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:20.867 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
healthy happiness

00:44:20.867 --> 00:44:23.995 align:middle line:90%
is another way of saying it.

00:44:23.995 --> 00:44:26.497 align:middle line:84%
A balanced happiness
is a healthy happiness

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:28.875 align:middle line:90%
and that's the spiritual piece.

00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this happiness
idea is a big topic.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
pursuit of happiness.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:39.302 align:middle line:84%
How does Ayurveda look at
the pursuit of happiness?

00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:41.178 align:middle line:84%
What you're basically
saying is that it's not

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:43.598 align:middle line:84%
something to pursue,
it's something to have.

00:44:43.598 --> 00:44:47.685 align:middle line:84%
It's something to just
set back in and enjoy.

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.645 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak to that, at all?

00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:52.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: And that's where the
piece that is really within

00:44:52.315 --> 00:44:54.901 align:middle line:90%
you--

00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:56.611 align:middle line:84%
so many people are
always going out

00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:58.821 align:middle line:84%
looking for things that are
going to make them happy.

00:44:58.821 --> 00:45:02.325 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the only thing
that can truly make you happy

00:45:02.325 --> 00:45:07.038 align:middle line:84%
is finding that little bit
of space inside of yourself

00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:11.208 align:middle line:90%
that is going to calm your mind.

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:84%
That gap, if you want
to talk Deepak Chopra

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:20.217 align:middle line:84%
language, that space with
between thoughts that really

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:22.511 align:middle line:90%
is a place of complete calm.

00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:25.806 align:middle line:84%
And within that, there's
so much happiness.

00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:32.104 align:middle line:84%
It's not as exciting, maybe,
as something on the physical,

00:45:32.104 --> 00:45:35.232 align:middle line:84%
but it's a certain kind
of joy that you get.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.318 align:middle line:84%
A certain kind of
nurturing and nourishment

00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:40.154 align:middle line:84%
that you get that
nothing else can replace.

00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:42.615 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
are looking for that

00:45:42.615 --> 00:45:45.826 align:middle line:84%
and they just don't really know
what they're searching for.

00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:49.121 align:middle line:84%
So that yearning, that longing,
that searching that people

00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:52.249 align:middle line:84%
feel that discontent
with their life.

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:55.503 align:middle line:84%
And they think they have to
fill it with material things.

00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:56.295 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Something.

00:45:56.295 --> 00:45:57.088 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Something.

00:45:57.088 --> 00:45:59.757 align:middle line:84%
Many times, it's really not
what they're looking for.

00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:02.093 align:middle line:90%
It's not on this physical plane.

00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And it is on that
spiritual plane.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.139 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when we talk
about healthy happiness,

00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:08.683 align:middle line:90%
that's what we're talking about.

00:46:08.683 --> 00:46:10.101 align:middle line:90%
And it's a balanced place.

00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:13.104 align:middle line:90%
It's not extreme in any way.

00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:15.356 align:middle line:84%
So there are many people
who even take the spiritual

00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:21.654 align:middle line:84%
to an extreme, where you give
up your whole life because you

00:46:21.654 --> 00:46:24.615 align:middle line:84%
think you need to be a
certain way spiritually.

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:26.909 align:middle line:84%
And we would say that's a
little too extreme, too.

00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:29.954 align:middle line:84%
There's a balance
for ordinary people,

00:46:29.954 --> 00:46:32.415 align:middle line:84%
if you're not going to want
to be a monk or something

00:46:32.415 --> 00:46:34.083 align:middle line:90%
like that, there's a balance.

00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:37.044 align:middle line:84%
There's a balance between
this life, this life

00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:37.962 align:middle line:90%
that you have to lead.

00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:38.921 align:middle line:90%
You have to make money.

00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:40.673 align:middle line:90%
You have to be comfortable.

00:46:40.673 --> 00:46:42.091 align:middle line:90%
You have to be happy.

00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:43.551 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
good relationships

00:46:43.551 --> 00:46:45.386 align:middle line:90%
with people around you.

00:46:45.386 --> 00:46:47.972 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a spiritual
piece you can add on, as well.

00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:50.558 align:middle line:84%
And so it's about the
balance of all of that.

00:46:50.558 --> 00:46:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I know you were
speaking about this discomfort

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.939 align:middle line:84%
with just being present,
just being with the gap,

00:46:56.939 --> 00:47:00.735 align:middle line:84%
being with the nothing, the
no thing, the nothingness.

00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:02.319 align:middle line:84%
One of the moments
in my life where

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.822 align:middle line:84%
I was under the most
stress and strain,

00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:08.242 align:middle line:84%
so many things happening
at the same moment in time,

00:47:08.242 --> 00:47:11.787 align:middle line:84%
and I buckled over
and fell onto my bed.

00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:15.916 align:middle line:84%
And people would have called
it a break down in that moment.

00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:18.419 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually,
a break in for me.

00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Because in that moment,
the deepest pain

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.923 align:middle line:84%
that I was feeling,
wrestling with

00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:25.051 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was falling
down this deep, dark well.

00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:27.928 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I
felt myself just let go.

00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:33.017 align:middle line:84%
And just say if everything goes
away, at least I'll have me.

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:34.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll just be right here.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.521 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment
of acceptance,

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:41.275 align:middle line:84%
there was the greatest sense
of joy I had ever experienced.

00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:43.486 align:middle line:84%
Here in the midst of all
this pain in my life,

00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:48.115 align:middle line:84%
this joy was rising up
that was so profound.

00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:51.285 align:middle line:84%
And I knew then that there
was something tremendously

00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:53.537 align:middle line:90%
important about accepting.

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:54.789 align:middle line:90%
Accepting what is happening.

00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:57.917 align:middle line:90%
Accepting ourselves, et cetera.

00:47:57.917 --> 00:48:00.711 align:middle line:84%
And this is that happiness
that you're speaking

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.004 align:middle line:90%
of that is unconditional.

00:48:02.004 --> 00:48:03.297 align:middle line:90%
It's inside of all of us.

00:48:03.297 --> 00:48:05.508 align:middle line:84%
That we're so busy
trying to make life

00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:08.511 align:middle line:84%
be a certain way that
we can't find it.

00:48:08.511 --> 00:48:10.596 align:middle line:90%
We can't land and find it.

00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:14.892 align:middle line:84%
You speak about
acceptance, compassion.

00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:18.854 align:middle line:84%
What can you share about
compassion in our conversation

00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:19.647 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:48:19.647 --> 00:48:21.607 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So I think it's
exactly what you said.

00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:24.151 align:middle line:84%
I think so much of it
is about our perceptions

00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:26.612 align:middle line:84%
and what we think
we need to be doing.

00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:30.032 align:middle line:84%
And compassion
starts with yourself.

00:48:30.032 --> 00:48:32.076 align:middle line:84%
Learning how to
be compassionate,

00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:35.204 align:middle line:84%
learning how to accept things
in your life for what they are.

00:48:35.204 --> 00:48:36.831 align:middle line:84%
So many times, I'll
tell somebody who's

00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:38.624 align:middle line:90%
tired well, just accept it.

00:48:38.624 --> 00:48:40.417 align:middle line:90%
You are tired.

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:43.754 align:middle line:84%
And learning how to
accept it for what it is

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:46.841 align:middle line:84%
makes it so that you're
not so hard on yourself.

00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:50.636 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where the whole
idea of nonviolence comes in.

00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And from an Ayurvedic
perspective,

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.516 align:middle line:84%
from a yoga perspective,
we talk in the East a lot

00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:57.143 align:middle line:90%
about nonviolence.

00:48:57.143 --> 00:49:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that nonviolence
really begins with you,

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.482 align:middle line:90%
individually, as a human being.

00:49:03.482 --> 00:49:07.278 align:middle line:84%
I think if you don't know how
to be nonviolent to yourself,

00:49:07.278 --> 00:49:11.615 align:middle line:84%
then you can't even talk
about it to other people.

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:15.202 align:middle line:84%
And so being
nonviolent to the self

00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:17.663 align:middle line:84%
is about feeding yourself
when you're hungry.

00:49:17.663 --> 00:49:19.790 align:middle line:90%
You poor body's hungry, feed it.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.043 align:middle line:84%
Your poor body's
tired, let it rest.

00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:25.337 align:middle line:84%
Don't feel guilty because
you're taking a nap.

00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:31.635 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's where
acceptance comes in,

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:34.180 align:middle line:90%
compassion.

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.516 align:middle line:84%
People need to learn
that sometimes it

00:49:37.516 --> 00:49:39.560 align:middle line:84%
requires you to think
of your body almost

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.813 align:middle line:84%
as something separate
from yourself.

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:46.525 align:middle line:84%
Because then you are more
compassionate towards it.

00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:48.444 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I'll--
just the other day,

00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I told a woman
who was seeing me,

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:54.617 align:middle line:84%
I said think of your
body as a puppy.

00:49:54.617 --> 00:49:55.659 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:56.952 align:middle line:90%
Would you not feed your puppy?

00:49:56.952 --> 00:49:58.996 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: One little whimper
and you're all over it.

00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:00.956 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: I know, I know.

00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:03.209 align:middle line:84%
Would you not listen to it
when it was crying and sad?

00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:05.294 align:middle line:90%
Would you not give it a big hug?

00:50:05.294 --> 00:50:07.922 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Shh, the
puppy's sleeping.

00:50:07.922 --> 00:50:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So if you start to think
of yourself almost as a puppy,

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.972 align:middle line:84%
then you realize how violent
you sometimes are to yourself.

00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:19.475 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
listen to it very much.

00:50:19.475 --> 00:50:21.227 align:middle line:84%
You don't feed it
when it needs feeding.

00:50:21.227 --> 00:50:23.312 align:middle line:84%
You don't let it sleep
when it needs sleeping.

00:50:23.312 --> 00:50:25.105 align:middle line:84%
You don't go to the
bathroom sometimes when

00:50:25.105 --> 00:50:26.273 align:middle line:90%
you need to go pee.

00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:28.192 align:middle line:90%
You hold everything in.

00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:31.195 align:middle line:84%
And the same way with
emotions, with everything.

00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:33.280 align:middle line:90%
There's so much violence.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.033 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's sort
of the key for people.

00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:39.328 align:middle line:84%
If they can understand
that and start

00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:41.372 align:middle line:84%
applying some of that
to their own self,

00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:45.376 align:middle line:84%
that compassion leads to then
some acceptance of whatever

00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:46.710 align:middle line:90%
condition you're in.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.296 align:middle line:84%
And that acceptance
actually frees you.

00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:51.715 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it--

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.550 align:middle line:84%
it allows you to
not be overwhelmed.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:55.469 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's a
freeing that happens,

00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:57.429 align:middle line:90%
just like you explained.

00:50:57.429 --> 00:50:58.722 align:middle line:90%
There's a freedom in there.

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:01.433 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
unusual thing that

00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:04.270 align:middle line:84%
happens that unless it
happens to you many times,

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:05.479 align:middle line:90%
you don't understand.

00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:08.148 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We don't have
a reference for it.

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:11.360 align:middle line:84%
In our Western world,
we don't give ourselves

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:17.074 align:middle line:84%
permission to tend to ourselves
the way that you're describing.

00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:20.077 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous amount
of guilt and expectation.

00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:24.123 align:middle line:84%
And we've carved a pathway,
neural pathways of habits,

00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:26.792 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs, and ways
of being that are so

00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:30.921 align:middle line:84%
driven by the mind, and
competition, and showing up,

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.715 align:middle line:90%
and expectations.

00:51:32.715 --> 00:51:37.845 align:middle line:84%
That this idea of
puppy is so far

00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:41.015 align:middle line:84%
from where we're
performing and living.

00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:43.517 align:middle line:84%
So for somebody who's
caught up in that,

00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:48.397 align:middle line:84%
it's really in the drive, what
would you recommend for them?

00:51:48.397 --> 00:51:52.067 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the obvious would be,
hey, give yourself permission.

00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:55.612 align:middle line:84%
But what if somebody's
like just full steam ahead?

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:56.572 align:middle line:90%
What do you recommend?

00:51:56.572 --> 00:51:58.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: So the way
I work, I always

00:51:58.032 --> 00:52:00.534 align:middle line:84%
work very gently with
people because you

00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:03.495 align:middle line:90%
can't make big changes.

00:52:03.495 --> 00:52:05.581 align:middle line:84%
And that's almost
another expectation

00:52:05.581 --> 00:52:07.416 align:middle line:84%
that then is going
to lead to failure.

00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:09.418 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
feel bad about yourself

00:52:09.418 --> 00:52:11.879 align:middle line:84%
because you want to change
your whole life overnight.

00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:14.006 align:middle line:84%
And that's just not
going to happen.

00:52:14.006 --> 00:52:15.132 align:middle line:90%
You're right, it's a habit.

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.467 align:middle line:90%
It's such a rut.

00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:18.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen overnight.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:20.763 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I
start very small.

00:52:20.763 --> 00:52:23.349 align:middle line:84%
For example, if there's a
mom and she's overworked,

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:25.434 align:middle line:84%
and she's busy,
and she's working,

00:52:25.434 --> 00:52:26.852 align:middle line:84%
and she's got the
kids, and she's

00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:30.022 align:middle line:84%
trying to balance
everything, so I

00:52:30.022 --> 00:52:31.982 align:middle line:84%
might say so you're
waiting in the car for 10

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.984 align:middle line:84%
minutes while your kids
coming out of school.

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.819 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you use
that 10 minutes?

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.488 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you use
that 10 minutes

00:52:37.488 --> 00:52:41.950 align:middle line:84%
to just close your eyes in your
car, take some deep breaths,

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:45.454 align:middle line:84%
and just be so happy and
grateful that you have that 10

00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:46.747 align:middle line:90%
minutes while you're waiting?

00:52:46.747 --> 00:52:47.539 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:52:47.539 --> 00:52:49.666 align:middle line:90%
Take the time.

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:51.752 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: You can use that time.

00:52:51.752 --> 00:52:54.963 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, it's
about the small moments.

00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:58.300 align:middle line:10%
Giving yourself a break
in the small moments.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:01.845 align:middle line:10%
Learning how to say
OK, so what can go?

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.847 align:middle line:90%
I'm super busy.

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:08.143 align:middle line:84%
I have so many things to take
care of, what can I get rid of?

00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:09.395 align:middle line:90%
And it's about priorities.

00:53:09.395 --> 00:53:12.106 align:middle line:84%
I think we all think we
want to do more than we

00:53:12.106 --> 00:53:14.691 align:middle line:90%
really physically can do.

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
about prioritizing.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.113 align:middle line:84%
And I'll sometimes tell
people so take one thing

00:53:19.113 --> 00:53:23.033 align:middle line:84%
off of your list every day, just
X it off your list every day.

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.785 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great
habit to get into.

00:53:24.785 --> 00:53:27.871 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm just going to X one
thing off my list every day.

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:31.041 align:middle line:84%
So starting small is a
great place to start.

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It seems so simple and
it's it'll move mountains.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.838 align:middle line:90%
It will move mountains.

00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:39.425 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
approach, just one little thing

00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:43.345 align:middle line:84%
at a time I'm going to turn
this ship around and be

00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:45.889 align:middle line:84%
living a different
life before I know it.

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:48.183 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so
much for being here.

00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:50.269 align:middle line:84%
When a medical doctor
sits down and says

00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:52.020 align:middle line:84%
you know what, loving
yourself is going

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.314 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the most
important components

00:53:54.314 --> 00:53:57.526 align:middle line:84%
that you can implement to
turn your health around,

00:53:57.526 --> 00:53:58.735 align:middle line:90%
it carries a lot of weight.

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.571 align:middle line:84%
It's different than
someone's best friend

00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:01.947 align:middle line:90%
saying that to them.

00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:04.533 align:middle line:84%
But you're doing this as
part of your practice.

00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:07.244 align:middle line:84%
And you're integrating
your integrative approach

00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:08.370 align:middle line:90%
with Ayurveda.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.457 align:middle line:84%
And bringing
science, lab testing,

00:54:11.457 --> 00:54:14.084 align:middle line:90%
all of this to the picture.

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:17.463 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, dropping
down to some fundamental basics

00:54:17.463 --> 00:54:21.508 align:middle line:84%
that are so important for
people to accept, to embrace,

00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:24.470 align:middle line:84%
to give themselves
permission to implement.

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:26.472 align:middle line:84%
And it's changing
people's lives.

00:54:26.472 --> 00:54:27.639 align:middle line:90%
>>NITA: Thank you very much.

00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:30.142 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Thank you so much for
what you're doing, who you are.

00:54:30.142 --> 00:54:32.519 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for
being here with us today

00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:34.188 align:middle line:90%
and sharing your brilliance.

00:54:34.188 --> 00:54:36.148 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that the
beauty of the human being

00:54:36.148 --> 00:54:41.028 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes is what
makes your practice flourish.

00:54:41.028 --> 00:54:42.654 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:45.449 align:middle line:84%
>>NITA: Thank you
and you're welcome.

00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:47.993 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: For many people who are
suffering with severe symptoms

00:54:47.993 --> 00:54:50.662 align:middle line:84%
or they may have even a small
chronic issue for which they

00:54:50.662 --> 00:54:53.916 align:middle line:84%
cannot get an answer, Ayurvedic
medicine may be just what they

00:54:53.916 --> 00:54:57.836 align:middle line:84%
need to find true health for
their mind, body, and spirit.
