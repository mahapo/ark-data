00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD GROUP: Welcome
back to "Healing Matrix."

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:84%
With us again is
Dr. Blanche Grube.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:10%
We're going to pick
up where we left off

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:10%
in the last episode discussing
the extreme toxicity

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:10%
of mercury, which despite
irrefutable scientific evidence

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:10%
is still being used today.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
To start, let's take a look
at just what mercury poisoning

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:90%
can do to the body.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And remember, it only
takes a tiny amount

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
of mercury, about
as much as what

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:84%
can fit on the tip
of this pencil,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
to wreak havoc on
your entire system.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.393 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the symptoms
that you've experienced?

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.310 align:middle line:10%
>>BLANCHE GRUBE: Well,
for me it was primarily

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:10%
brain fog, and then cancer.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:10%
I guess I was fortunate
enough to skip

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:10%
the chronic fatigue that
most patients get in between.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's different-- it's
different for everybody.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on what
your weak genetic link is.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
If your weak genetic link
is to have chronic fatigue,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.767 align:middle line:84%
then that's where
it's going to go.

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I mean,
autoimmune diseases,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:84%
it affects the gut-- there's
so many different things

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:90%
that mercury toxicity affects.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yeah.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What
about infertility?

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that mercury
is affecting people's--

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.657 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: --ability to conceive.

00:01:35.657 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well,
remember we were having

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:84%
a discussion about mercury
attacking all of the protein

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:90%
molecules in our body?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of our hormones--
our hormones are proteins.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're-- the hormones that
you're producing to make you

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
ovulate, to be able to carry
a pregnancy to term are being

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
messed up by mercury, then
you're not going to be able

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:90%
to carry a pregnancy to term.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing more and
more young couples just not

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:90%
being able to conceive.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Autoimmune diseases
seems like it's more and more.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
pandemic or something.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with
mercury and autoimmune?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, mercury causes
the body to attack itself.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:84%
When mercury attacks a
cell, the body no longer

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
recognizes that
cell as being you.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That really is the function
of the immune system.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Those white blood
cells float around

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
in the bloodstream
all day long just

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
looking-- self,
non-self, self, non-self.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And the moment they see a cell,
even if it's part of you--

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
it's one of your muscle cells,
it's one of your nerve cells--

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
but it has mercury
attached to it,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
the body recognizes
it as non-self

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and begins to attack it.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot of
patients that have diabetes.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes is defined as
an autoimmune disease.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
We have patients with MS,
another autoimmune disease.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Rheumatoid arthritis.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:90%
The list is endless.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Why do you think some
people get symptoms and some

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:90%
people don't?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: That's the
million dollar question.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that some
people can smoke and don't

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:90%
get lung cancer?

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that some people
can drink every night

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.137 align:middle line:84%
and not become alcoholic and not
develop cirrhosis of the liver?

00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:17.595 align:middle line:84%
Well, because we're
all individual.

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yeah.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And we all have
different weak genetic links.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Some people just have
a stronger affinity for things.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that it
still causes some damage

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:90%
That's irrefutable.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: There's just
no way that it could not.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a toxin to the body.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Exactly.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So we have one
of Dr. Blanche's patients

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:84%
who suffered greatly
from mercury poisoning

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:90%
joining us today on Skype.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Here's David Staley
and his wife Patty.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Hi, David.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Patty.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.936 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us today.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:48.853 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID STALEY: Hello.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PATTY STALEY: Hi, doctors.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Hi.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PATTY: Good to see you both.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.515 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Hi.

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So David,
tell us, when

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
did you first get silver
fillings, or amalgams?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, boy.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Young age.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.884 align:middle line:90%
Young age.

00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PATTY: When you
were in grade school.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah, grade school.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I went to the dentist
regularly, and probably

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
had fillings put
in consistently.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.769 align:middle line:84%
When I say consistently, almost
every trip to the dentist

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
it seemed I was getting
drilled and filled.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:90%
So I've had quite a few--

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.510 align:middle line:90%
quite a few through the years.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: When did you actually
start noticing health changes

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:90%
for the negative?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: I would say,
probably, it was late 30s--

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:10%
39, 40, something like that--

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:10%
where I began with the
neurological symptoms.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.203 align:middle line:10%
Leading up to that, I
would get sinus infections.

00:04:48.203 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PATTY: Serious
sinus infections.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Serious
sinus infections.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Had workups done,
and nothing really

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:90%
pointed to the reason why.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But when I started with
the neurological symptoms--

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and the correlation there was,
I was going to the dentist

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
regularly, not realizing
the connection at the time,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:90%
but had--

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
just was, every six
months, getting cleanings.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, probably, I had
good insurance at the time.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.025 align:middle line:90%
So I was utilizing that.

00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And as that was
proceeding-- and again,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:90%
not making the connection--

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I started having vague symptoms.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Insomnia was
starting to creep in.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:84%
That was probably one
of the beginning signs.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PATTY: Numbness and tingling.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah,
numbness, tingling,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:90%
left side of my body--

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.480 align:middle line:90%
mostly on the left side.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And in hindsight, and looking
at the dental work that

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.195 align:middle line:84%
was being done, a lot of it
was on the left side of my--

00:05:57.195 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
in my mouth.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But it progressed
from the insomnia to--

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.035 align:middle line:90%
oh, man, memory loss, anxiety.

00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PATTY: I thought, you know,
we should go get a checkup.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And he started-- at that
point, he just started building

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
from not having a chart at
the doctor's office to slowly,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
incrementally, his
chart just began

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to grow and grow and
grow until it was

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:90%
this thick inside of one year.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And still, the doctor
had no answers for him.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And then one day he went
in-- we were just getting

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.870 align:middle line:90%
ready to go on vacation.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And he went in to see him
one last time, totally

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and completely exhausted.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Flopped on the office
couch, and Anna came out

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:90%
and she said to him, come in.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:90%
And what's wrong?

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And, well, it's the same
thing that's been wrong

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:90%
for the last nine months.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:90%
So in he goes.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And then the doctor came in.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, keep in mind, all
the blood work that was done--

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:84%
blood work, it all
came back fine.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And he would look at it and
just kind of shake his head.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And eventually--

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PATTY: That day.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.018 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That day,
pretty much told me--

00:07:25.018 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
called me into his
office, closed the door,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and said, listen, I think
you need to go see somebody.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:90%
And I said, see somebody?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean?

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him and
I went, you telling me

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:90%
I need to see a psychiatrist?

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:90%
And he shook his head.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:90%
And I went, no.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, that's it.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I just told him, I said,
you're not finding my problem.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It was very frustrating.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.095 align:middle line:90%
So at that point, we started--

00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PATTY: Looking
outside the box.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Yeah, looking
outside of the box.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I think the tipping point
to calling a doctor--

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:84%
again, I was born and
raised in this area--

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:90%
was driving.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And I pulled up to a stop sign.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And again, I knew where I was.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:90%
But I just blanked out.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- I didn't know if
I should turn left or right.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And that really scared me.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my god,
I'm losing my mind now.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I can't even think straight.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So I made the phone call,
and I went to see a doctor.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And that was
Dr. Von Kiel, correct?

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yes, yes.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
It was Dr. Von Kiel.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And he started-- he
asked me questions.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And at one point he said, can
I take a look in your mouth?

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course I said,
OK, wondering why.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And he got a tongue depressor
and was looking in my mouth.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.042 align:middle line:84%
And he said, boy, you have
a lot of metal in there.

00:09:06.042 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, I've had
it for a long time.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So it turned out that when
the test results came back,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.405 align:middle line:90%
I had probably--

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I think he said
I had the highest

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:84%
level of mercury and nickel
that he's seen in a patient.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Wow.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PATTY: Yes.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And at that point
he explained some things.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, I would
have to get the fillings out.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a list
of several dentists

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and said he had no financial
interest in this whatsoever.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And but he said that
the patients that he

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:90%
sent to Dr. Blanche got well.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:90%
So at that point--

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
he did, by the way, explain
to me about the vitamin C IVs.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And so I went to him regularly.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Probably was doing two or
three vitamin C IVs a week

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:90%
until I got to see Dr. Blanche.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And made it to see her.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was, what, over
a period of about a month she

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
took all the fillings
out, quadrant at a time.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, the symptoms
started resolving.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Amazing.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: What a story.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, since you
were a little kid,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
having all that metal in your
mouth, and didn't even know.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
happening a lot today.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So many people are going
to the doctor's office,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're being diagnosed with
all these different conditions.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
They're being put on all
these pharmaceuticals.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors are not
looking in their mouth.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Blanche, what were
your thoughts when you

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:90%
met David for the first time?

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, having had
so much experience listening

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:84%
to Hal Huggins, as
soon as he walked

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
into the office I just said, oh,
one more mercury toxic patient.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I knew that was what
his problem was.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
In those days, we didn't
have conscious sedation.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So Dave had his
fillings removed what

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I call the old fashioned
way, one section at a time.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we made
sure that we took out

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
the section that had the
highest negative charge first.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.287 align:middle line:84%
That's always a must,
even to this day.

00:11:21.287 --> 00:11:23.620 align:middle line:84%
You always have to take out
the filling with the highest

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.300 align:middle line:84%
negative charge,
because then that

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
allows the body to realize, oh,
yes, a change has taken place.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he started
feeling better right away.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if he had the
highest level of mercury

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever seen,
what about detox?

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:84%
You had to be pretty
careful about detoxifying--

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Absolutely.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: --his system, right?

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And there's no one
way to detoxify everybody.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Every patient is different.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I get that question
all the time.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
People say, what's the
best way to detoxify?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
There is no best
way to detoxify.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people do
better in a sauna.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Some people do
better with cilantro.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Some people do
better with charcoal.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is different.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have
one detox protocol

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.532 align:middle line:90%
for all of our patients.

00:12:09.532 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So David,
how long did it

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
take before you really
started feeling better

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
with the insomnia, with
the fatigue once you

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:90%
had the amalgams removed?

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Fairly quick.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't overnight.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:90%
But the improvements were--

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I was noticing improvements
probably first couple weeks

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:90%
with the sleeping.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I just have to
say, I used to say

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that this was a
living hell for me,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to go through what I
went through until--

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:90%
because you want to--

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:84%
you can fight something when you
know what it is, or who it is,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:90%
or what it is.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until I found out
that I had, OK, let's go.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the-- you
start searching out

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:90%
what you need to do.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Blanche
and Dr. Von Kiel--

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:84%
those two people saved my
life, the way I look at it.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I feel that if those
fillings were not removed

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I probably would end up with
MS, and I'd be in a wheelchair.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PATTY: Or worse.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Or worse.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How are you
feeling today, David?

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I have to
tell you, I have some--

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
maybe some lingering
neurological.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:90%
But for-- my energy abounds.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:90%
I have no problem sleeping.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:84%
For my age, sometimes-- some
of the fellows that work for me

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:90%
are 20 years younger.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And I can run
circles around them.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I just--

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
so-- and I know this would
not have happened had I not

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:90%
had these fillings out.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I just--

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PATTY: No.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
That's not the road that we
were heading down back then.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yeah.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
We're so glad that
you're feeling better.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Blanche, do
you have anything

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to comment on
regarding David's story--

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: No.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I just want to say thank you.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: --and Patty.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, thank you.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And I
appreciate both of them--

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PATTY: Thank you.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: --very much.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:10.935 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Just thank you.

00:14:10.935 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yeah.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming on today.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yeah.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PATTY: Thank you for
what you both are doing.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yes.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Thank you.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Trying to get the word out.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if
somebody is actually

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:84%
watching this right
now and they're saying,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:84%
hey, I might have
these symptoms,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
what would you tell them
to do at this moment?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, unfortunately,
it is a matter of finances.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:10%
Ideally, they should find
a good biological dentist,

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:10%
one that is board certified--

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:10%
IABDM is my favorite
organization--

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:10%
so you know that they
know what they're doing.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Find a good biological dentist.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Get the fillings done safely.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Get them taken out.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are a lot of
people that are going to say,

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I just can't afford that.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you can't
afford that, at least

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.248 align:middle line:84%
stop putting more
mercury into your body.

00:15:00.248 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Wait, are you telling
me that dental insurance does

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
not cover--

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: No.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --mercury
amalgam removal?

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: No, I'm sorry.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:90%
I hate to burst your bubble.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
But no, dental
insurance does not

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
cover mercury amalgam
removal for the sake

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:90%
of removing a mercury--

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:90%
toxic product from your tooth.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the tooth
has to be replaced

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's not serviceable,
that's a different story.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Then they will pay
for part of that.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:90%
You notice I said part of that.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So for those of you
who can't afford

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
to have the full dental
revision, because it usually

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
does cost a few
thousand dollars--

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
if you can't afford to
do that, for God's sake,

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.610 align:middle line:90%
please stop eating fish.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Stop chewing gum,
because when you

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
chew gum you heat up the
surface of the teeth,

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're giving
yourself more mercury.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
After you eat a meal, the
level of mercury rises.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the
meal gets digested,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:84%
the level of mercury
being released slows down.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And then comes the next meal,
and the level of mercury

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
rises again.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to be
chewing gum in between meals,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
you're keeping that
level of mercury

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:84%
being released from the
teeth high at all times.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:90%
So number one, stop eating fish.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Number two, stop chewing gum.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Number three, take care of
your mouth as best you can.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And that means
flossing, irrigating

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
with sodium ascorbate,
keeping your gums as healthy

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:90%
as you possibly can.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
If you have gum disease and
you have mercury fillings,

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to have
complete resolution of your gum

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
disease so long as the
mercury is still there.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean you
just throw in the towel

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.837 align:middle line:90%
and not do anything.

00:16:38.837 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:84%
You still try to keep your
mouth as healthy and as clean

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And then start your own fund.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Put in a certain
amount of money,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever you can afford,
towards your dental revision,

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know how
long you're going to live.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know how
many more years you have

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
before you begin
to get symptoms.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:84%
As Dave and Patty
were telling us,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
it took quite a few years before
he really started getting sick.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
He didn't drop sick right
out of the dental office

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:90%
when he was a kid.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Same with me.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Nobody made that
connection because it

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%
doesn't happen right away.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.119 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not sick, if
you don't have symptoms,

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
now is the time
to start saving up

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.020 align:middle line:90%
for your full dental revision.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And then make sure that
it's done properly,

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
that you have a biocompatibility
test done beforehand,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that you have IV vitamin C,
that you have a dentist that

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
knows to put on a rubber
dam, to put suction,

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:90%
to have lots of water.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we
all have a responsibility

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:90%
to protect the environment.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So ask the dentists, do they
have an amalgam separator

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:84%
to separate the water before it
hits our streams and our sewer

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:90%
systems?

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
things that a person

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
can do if they can't afford to
have the full dental revision.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yeah.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to clarify, if
somebody is watching this show

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and they say, I think I'm
being poisoned by mercury,

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.210 align:middle line:84%
if they go to their
general practitioner,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
if they go to their
medical doctor,

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:84%
is their medical
doctor going to be

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:90%
able to test them for mercury?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Or is this--

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yes.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.983 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --something that
they should go straight

00:18:09.983 --> 00:18:11.432 align:middle line:90%
to a biological dentist?

00:18:11.432 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: No, their medical
doctor can do tests.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:90%
They can do urine tests.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:90%
They can do a hair analysis.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:90%
They can see where they're at.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, they're
going to need the dentist.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Eventually you need to
sit in that dental chair.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that you can do.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
A medical doctor, or a
chiropractor, or a naturopath

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.830 align:middle line:84%
can give recommendations
about things

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
to keep their bowels
clean and to help detox

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.920 align:middle line:84%
some of the mercury while
they're still having

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:90%
the mercury in their mouth.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:84%
They can do all kinds
of things like that.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But eventually they will still
have to sit in the dental chair

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and have the full
dental revision done.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Why does the ADA only
list mercury as an allergy?

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: I have no idea.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:90%
It is not an allergy.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing as an--

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people are
also allergic to mercury.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:90%
But it's toxic for everybody.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.665 align:middle line:90%
The same with nickel.

00:19:01.665 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:84%
They say that there
are some people who

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:90%
are allergic to nickel.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But nickel is also a
carcinogenic for everybody.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: I just don't get it.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
scientific studies

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
that prove that mercury
is one of the most

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:90%
toxic elements in mankind.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Yet it's still allowed to
be put in people's mouths.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: I don't get it.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:90%
I really don't get it.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And every time the
American Dental Association

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
says that there's
plenty of studies

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:90%
to prove that it's safe--

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen one single study
produced by them, not a one.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how does that
make you feel when you talk

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.562 align:middle line:90%
to these conventional dentists?

00:19:39.562 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you hold
them responsible for not

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:84%
educating themselves on
the dangers of mercury?

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: No, I hold the
schools responsible,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
because the schools don't
want to rock the boat.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to change
their funding in any way.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is
always-- everybody's

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:84%
always looking at
the-- their pocketbook

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:84%
first and their pockets
first before they

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:84%
make a decision as to what
they should really be doing.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Why aren't the
schools teaching this?

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Biological dentistry.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.736 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: They're getting funded.

00:20:11.736 --> 00:20:14.153 align:middle line:84%
They're getting funded by the
companies that make amalgam.

00:20:14.153 --> 00:20:14.953 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Mm-hmm.

00:20:14.953 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: So they're not
about to teach the opposite.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So Dr.
Blanche, let's talk

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:90%
about removing silver fillings.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:84%
When did dentistry, or
biological dentistry,

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:84%
start actually removing
these silver fillings,

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:90%
or mercury-based fillings?

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, that began
with Dr. Hal Huggins.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hal Huggins is the one who
decided how would it be best

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
to remove the mercury fillings
without the patient getting

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:90%
more mercury.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And so he was one of the first
to say you must use a rubber

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:90%
dam.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So he actually
invented the rubber dam,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:90%
because he--

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.788 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: He didn't
invent the rubber dam.

00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The rubber dam was actually
used in dentistry for root canal

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:84%
treatments so that when you were
filing the inside of a tooth

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and you accidentally
drop the file,

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't drop the file
down the patient's throat.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So in dental school,
we were taught,

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
you must use a rubber dam
when you do a root canal.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:10%
And I graduated from
dental school in 1982.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:10%
100% of my classmates
said, I am never

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:10%
going to use a rubber dam again
unless I'm doing a root canal.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.063 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And so all of
those vapors, probably--

00:21:26.063 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That's right.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --chunks of
mercury, everything else,

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:90%
the patient swallowed.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Wow.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And in those days,
almost every dental office

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.632 align:middle line:84%
had a spittoon, a
little porcelain sink.

00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And when the dentist was
filling-- finished drilling,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.720 align:middle line:84%
they would say, take
some water and spit.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.605 align:middle line:84%
And you would spit
into the sink.

00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And you would hear
clink, clink, clink,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:84%
clink-- all these little
pieces of mercury amalgam.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And how many times did
you also take some water

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and accidentally
swallow a little bit

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.395 align:middle line:84%
and get some more of it
going into your intestines?

00:21:57.395 --> 00:21:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Is that
still going on today?

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.353 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: That is still going
on today, I'm sorry to say.

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Mm.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: And it has got to stop.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, we have
some shocking video for you

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.355 align:middle line:84%
of just what can happen when
a mercury filling is removed.

00:22:10.355 --> 00:22:10.905 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.905 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:10%
>>MATTHEW YOUNG: We're trying
to visualize here and prove

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:10%
the fact that there's a
significant amount that

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.090 align:middle line:10%
comes off during the
mixing, during the packing.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.183 align:middle line:10%
And then we have some
teeth with the amalgam

00:22:20.183 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:10%
that's been set for a while.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.808 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
be removing that

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:10%
with a high-speed
dental drill in order

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:10%
to visualize how much vapor
comes off during that procedure

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:10%
>>BOYD HALEY: The American
Dental Association

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:10%
has made the
argument that mercury

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:10%
is fixed in amalgam fillings,
and it doesn't come out easily.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:10%
And what this research that
we're doing here visually shows

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:10%
is that when you drill
on an amalgam filling,

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:10%
that it dramatically exposes
the patient, and the dentist,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:10%
and the dental technician, to
huge amounts of mercury vapor

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.450 align:middle line:10%
that enters the body.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:10%
It's even worse than
what they imagined.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEX HUMMEL: 2,483
micrograms per cubic meter.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:10%
And I've never seen levels
of mercury this high.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:10%
That's pretty much unheard of
in any type of work environment.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>>HALEY: Because it definitely
shows with just absolute fact,

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:10%
hard science, that
amalgams, when

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.980 align:middle line:10%
they are heated with the
drill, by drilling on them,

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.790 align:middle line:10%
release copious amounts of
mercury vapor into the air.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: That is
just shocking to see.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Mm-hmm.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: They should play that
video in every dentist's office

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.455 align:middle line:90%
before--

00:23:21.455 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.158 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --someone goes in
and gets a cavity filled.

00:23:24.158 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Then all the
patients would go running out.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Well, yeah.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
That probably would
be a good thing.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Hopefully, they'd find
a biological dentist somewhere.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what exactly is
involved in a safe mercury

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.387 align:middle line:90%
amalgam removal?

00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, number
one, the patient

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
has to be prepared
with supplementation.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And the patient has to be able
to have a good bowel movement.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I know you probably
didn't expect a dentist

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to start talking about
bowel movements right now.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:90%
But when you detoxify mercury--

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's what happens right
after a mercury revision.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
When you detoxify mercury,
80% of the mercury

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:90%
goes through the bowel.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And so if a patient
is constipated,

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:84%
that's not a good patient
to do a dental revision on.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So we like to make sure that our
patients are never constipated,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that things are flowing very
nicely, that they're taking

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:84%
minerals, that
they're on a good diet

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.830 align:middle line:84%
before they ever sit
in the dental chair.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, once they get
in the dental chair,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
we have IV vitamin C
flowing through their arms.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So are you saying that
before they even come in for--

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Before they--

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: --amalgam removal--

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --you have them on a
one-week or a two-week program

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:84%
to clean their diet up, make
sure they're not constipated--

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --get their body
prepared for the procedure.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Correct.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
come in we do--

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
we have IV vitamin C
flowing in their bloodstream

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
just prior to actually
getting started.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing we do.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got our
biocompatibility list.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
We know exactly what dental
materials we can put in.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:84%
We've sometimes have to purchase
those dental materials to make

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:90%
sure we have them on board.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Then the patient is sedated.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Then the patient
receives anesthetic.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And in our office, we
don't use any anesthetic

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:90%
that has epinephrine in it.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.878 align:middle line:84%
And we'll discuss that
in another interview.

00:25:09.878 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:90%
The patient gets an anesthetic.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we place a rubber
dam over the section

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to be working on.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing
that is showing

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
are the teeth that
need to have work done.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:84%
There's suction on the other
side of the rubber dam,

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.050 align:middle line:84%
on the inside of
the patient's mouth.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
There's suction on our
side of the rubber dam.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.603 align:middle line:84%
The rubber dam itself is smeared
with a sulfur-based cream.

00:25:34.603 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you the story
about how that came about.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, we actually have
some photos in your office--

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Oh, very good.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --if
that's going to help.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can talk us
through some of those.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, the dentist
has a hat covering her head.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:90%
She's got a gas mask on.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:90%
She's got her eyes covered.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
We're fully draped.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:90%
And we've got gloves on.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:10%
And as the mercury fillings
are being drilled on,

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:10%
the dental assistant is spraying
water on top of all of it

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:10%
so that most of it goes
up into the suction hose.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the safest way
to remove amalgam.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, right
in front of the patient

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
is something that looks
like a white elephant nose.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:84%
We actually call that
Mr. Snuffleupagus.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Snuffleupagus is a very
high-powered vacuum cleaner

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
with a filter in it so
that it sucks the air

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and keeps a positive
airflow away from us.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Behind the patient's
head is a machine

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:90%
called a mercury vapor ionizer.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:84%
This little machine spits
out 600,000 electrons

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:84%
per second that flow in an
arch over our working space

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and get hooked onto a
receiver at the other end.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, everything that
is positively charged

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.060 align:middle line:90%
is bad for us.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.910 align:middle line:84%
The mercury particles that
go floating in the air

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:90%
are positively charged.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria that may come out
of the patient's mouth--

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:90%
positively charged.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Viruses-- positively charged.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I could go on and on and on.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Mm-hmm.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: That
mercury vapor ionizer

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.720 align:middle line:84%
zaps all those positively
charged particles and gets them

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.830 align:middle line:90%
away from us.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see, the
patient is fully draped.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Their head is covered.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Their whole body is covered.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:90%
They've got the rubber dam on.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And then on top
of that, we've got

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:84%
another piece of plastic covered
paper to cover that completely.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So the only part of
them that is exposed

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.800 align:middle line:84%
are the teeth that
we're working on.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got the
ionizer behind them.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
We've got suction in the
front, suction in the back.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We've got IV vitamin C flowing
through their bloodstream.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:90%
This is a big deal.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:42.920 align:middle line:90%
This is a big deal.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
We do everything
we can possibly do

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to keep the patient from getting
one more molecule of mercury.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So take us
through the actual process.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:84%
A patient comes to
your office, says,

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to get my
amalgams removed.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.223 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What's the first
thing that you guys do?

00:27:58.223 --> 00:28:00.373 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming a good
history with the patient.

00:28:00.373 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Well, before they would
ever even walk into our office,

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:90%
they're calling us on the phone.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Oh.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And so that
initial phone call

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.970 align:middle line:84%
can be anywhere from
an hour to two hours,

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
because the patients need
to tell us their story.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we send the patient
an information packet,

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.750 align:middle line:84%
which includes a prescription
for a blood test,

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:84%
a prescription
for hair analysis,

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:84%
a questionnaire because I want
to know their whole history

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:90%
from the time they were little.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Many patients, as they're
filling out that questionnaire,

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:90%
they have that aha moment.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:90%
They go, wait a minute.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.800 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I started having the allergies
after that fifth filling

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.635 align:middle line:90%
was put in.

00:28:41.635 --> 00:28:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Or-- you know, they
have an aha moment.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:90%
They understand.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So just filling out
that questionnaire

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and putting all the dates
and what your symptoms were

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is a very educational tool
for the patients themselves.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.960 align:middle line:90%
So they fill all of that out.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And we send them the kit for
the biocompatibility test also.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So even before they
come to our office

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:84%
they've already
done a lot of work.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:84%
They've already had blood
drawn from their arm.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:84%
They've had somebody-- hopefully
somebody merciful would cut

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of hair off
the back of their neck,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:90%
the little--

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:90%
about three inches.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And they've already had the
questionnaire filled out.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:84%
They now have their
biocompatibility test done.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So now they know
what dental materials

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:90%
they can put in their mouth.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Now they're ready for their big
day, which is their exam day.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:84%
They come into the office
with all of that material.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And we very carefully
spend two to three hours

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.320 align:middle line:90%
going over everything.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Then we do a
complete examination.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:90%
We do X-rays.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:84%
We do a 3D cone beam
scan of the head.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What is the difference
between a 3D cone beam scan

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:90%
and an X-ray, a standard X-ray?

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: A standard X-ray
is only two dimensional.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:10%
It's a flat picture
of something that

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:10%
is actually three dimensions.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.080 align:middle line:10%
So with the new
cone beams that--

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:10%
it's only 14 seconds the
X-ray goes around the head.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:10%
The image gets placed
into my computer.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And in my computer, I can
slice the patient like an MRI.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:84%
I can slice them in an AP
direction, anterior, posterior.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I can slice them
right to left side.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I can slice them diagonally.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I can slice them from the top.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I can look at them in every
which direction I want to.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
abscesses on teeth

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:84%
that you could not see in
a two-dimensional picture.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You see the depth and
the width of a cavity,

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:42.142 align:middle line:84%
not just the little radiographic
darkness that tells you, yes,

00:30:42.142 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:90%
there's a cavity there.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
You actually see how big the
cavity is because everything

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:90%
is in three dimensions.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:84%
If the patient has an
infection in their jawbone,

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.240 align:middle line:90%
we can see that in a 3D picture.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So it really has brought
radiography and dentistry

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.577 align:middle line:84%
into the 21st century,
where years from now,

00:31:01.577 --> 00:31:04.160 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say, it was the
dark ages when they were just

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:90%
looking at 2D.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So after that
scan, then what happens?

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: After that
scan, then we sit down

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:90%
and we do a very thorough exam.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:90%
We do a cancer screening.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.060 align:middle line:90%
We do a periodontal screening.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We do an occlusion
screening to see, how

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.470 align:middle line:90%
is the bite coming together?

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Then I go over all of
their blood chemistry.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I go over their hair analysis,
give them recommendations

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:90%
about supplementation.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Then we write up
a treatment plan.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the treatment
plan has three or four

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:90%
alternative treatment plans.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:84%
By then, the patient's
head is spinning.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And I like it when they
come with a spouse,

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
they come with other
family members.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's in a living room setup.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Our exam room has
very comfortable seats

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:90%
plus the examination chair.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So we welcome other
people in the family

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.250 align:middle line:84%
to join in and
give their opinion.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we get lucky--
the patient can actually

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:90%
make a decision that day.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they need to
gather all this material

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:90%
and take it home and digest it.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So during the
procedure, you're detoxifying.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.403 align:middle line:84%
What happens after
the procedure?

00:32:07.403 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: After the
procedure, then

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.520 align:middle line:84%
they usually will see my
husband, who's a chiropractor.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Or they go to back to their
naturopath, their physician,

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:90%
or their chiropractor.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And we together will work
out a detoxification plan

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.270 align:middle line:90%
for that patient.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: For the
individual patient.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Yes.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's different
for everybody.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How do you know-- you
talked about biocompatibility.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:84%
How would you explain
that to each individual?

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.395 align:middle line:84%
What is the testing
procedure like?

00:32:34.395 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Mm-hmm.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And why is it
different for each individual?

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I first heard
about it, I was shocked.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
that's a unique idea--

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:84%
find out what somebody's
allergic to before you put it

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:90%
in the mouth.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:90%
What a unique idea.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.820 align:middle line:90%
This is just fantastic.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think about it,
if you had an allergic problem

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.720 align:middle line:84%
with dairy, would you go
into a French restaurant

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and tell the chef to bring
whatever's on the menu?

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Bring whatever
you think is best?

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:84%
You would never do that,
because in a French restaurant

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.770 align:middle line:84%
you know it's going
to have dairy.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have butter,
because every French meal

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.870 align:middle line:84%
starts out with those
two ingredients, right?

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet in dentistry we
go into the dental office

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and we say to the dentist, well,
give me what you think is best.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.290 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we do that
in the physician's office too.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.948 align:middle line:84%
And these poor physicians
write out prescriptions--

00:33:26.948 --> 00:33:28.740 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they don't
even know what they're

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:90%
writing out prescriptions for.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say it.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm amazed at how
many people come out

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
of a doctor's office,
a medical doctor's

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.120 align:middle line:84%
office, with a prescription in
their hand for an antibiotic.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And I say, oh, did
they do a culture?

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Did he take a culture
of your throat

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:84%
before he gave you
that prescription?

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, how does he know, then,
which antibiotic to give you?

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:84%
How does the dentist know
which filling material

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.080 align:middle line:84%
to put in your mouth without
doing a compatibility

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:90%
test first?

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So just to be
clear, what you're doing is

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:05.830 align:middle line:84%
you're just finding out what
type of composite or what you

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.460 align:middle line:84%
can replace those
fillings with--

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Correct.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --that are
not going to cause

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.503 align:middle line:84%
any type of negative
reaction in the patient.

00:34:12.503 --> 00:34:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And so how
do you measure that?

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:84%
You measure that by looking
at the immune reactive cells

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Those are our white blood cells.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:84%
That's the army
that is constantly

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:90%
looking for self or non-self.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, so here
we have a problem,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.179 align:middle line:84%
because we have to put a dental
material in your mouth that's

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:32.870 align:middle line:90%
not you.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.880 align:middle line:90%
So your body's going to react.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.681 align:middle line:84%
But we want something that
is going to react the least.

00:34:38.681 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, we actually
had the opportunity

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.109 align:middle line:84%
to visit BioComp labs
in Colorado Springs.

00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.909 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.076 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Let's take a look.

00:34:45.076 --> 00:34:47.399 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Hi.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:49.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Blanche Grube.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing in front
of the building that

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.639 align:middle line:84%
houses my two laboratories
and my education company,

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:84%
called Huggins Applied
Healing, DNA ConneXions,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:90%
and BioComp Laboratories.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
all happens, where

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:84%
the doctors and the
patients are educated

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.480 align:middle line:84%
from beginning to end and
find everything that they

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.460 align:middle line:90%
need for their healing journey.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time we've ever

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.390 align:middle line:84%
allowed somebody to do filming
inside of our companies.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So I've allowed Gaia to come in
and give you all the privilege

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.820 align:middle line:90%
of seeing what goes on inside.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Come on in.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.385 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.385 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So when a doctor
has been educated,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and they know how to
protect the patient

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and remove all the toxic
materials from their mouth

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and do it properly,
then they have

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.830 align:middle line:84%
to answer to the
question of, what

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:90%
do I put in the patient's mouth?

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where BioComp
Laboratories comes into play.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We're a laboratory,
also CLIA certified,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that tests the serum of a
patient with dental components.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Kendall, can you show us
what one of the samples

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.655 align:middle line:90%
looks like when it comes--

00:35:56.655 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:90%
ah, look at that.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You notice it's got a
little bit of an orange hue.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's not red.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:84%
The red blood cells would have
been at the bottom of that test

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.450 align:middle line:90%
tube.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And they were disposed of.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:90%
This is the serum portion.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:13.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the part that has all
of the different proteins that

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:16.540 align:middle line:90%
are part of the immune system.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:84%
We have 88 different
dental components.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:84%
All 88 wells would be filled,
placed into this machine.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:90%


00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:84%
When the machine is done mixing
the serum with the dental

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
components-- it takes
about 20 minutes--

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
then we pass a light
through that test tube.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:84%
If the light goes through
the test tube very easily,

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.190 align:middle line:84%
meaning the amount of light
that comes in on one end

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.140 align:middle line:84%
is almost the same as
the amount of light

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.210 align:middle line:84%
that comes out the
other end, then

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:49.220 align:middle line:84%
that is a material
that is relatively

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:84%
safe for the patient, or what
we would call least reactive.

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:58.040 align:middle line:84%
If the immune system does
not like a dental material,

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:90%
it will clump around it.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:84%
It will cause the test tube
to turn opaque, or white.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.010 align:middle line:90%
And less light goes through it.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:84%
That's called a highly
reactive material.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want
to put something

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
in your mouth that is going to
cause your immune system to be

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:19.700 align:middle line:84%
constantly fighting against
it, to be constantly trying

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.660 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, how do
we get rid of this?

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:84%
You always want to
put a dental material

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.600 align:middle line:84%
in your mouth that
is least reactive,

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that your immune
system recognizes.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not self, but it also
doesn't freak out and say,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:90%
we've got to get rid of this.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Most people are sick
because they have materials

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.080 align:middle line:84%
in their mouth that
their immune system

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:84%
has been trying to get rid
of for 20, 30, 40 years,

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and the immune
system is exhausted.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So now the computer has
received all the information

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.700 align:middle line:84%
it knows about how much light
passed through the test tube

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and generated the
compatibility report.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:84%
This report has
literally thousands

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.640 align:middle line:90%
of dental materials in it.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And it tells the patient
what they're OK with

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.380 align:middle line:90%
and what they're not OK with.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very easy for a
dentist to take a look at this.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And now the patient
is going to have

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:84%
something put in their
mouth that they're

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:90%
very compatible with.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Now that you know what
you know, my wish for you

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is that before you have
any dentistry done,

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.610 align:middle line:84%
you have a biocompatibility
test done first

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and have safe
dentistry completed.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Thank you
so much for allowing

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:90%
our cameras behind the scenes.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: You're welcome.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I think that was the
only time you've ever allowed

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.470 align:middle line:90%
cameras in your lab, correct?

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That is correct.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:84%
We have never allowed
somebody to actually come

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.760 align:middle line:84%
into our laboratory and
see what's going on.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:84%
But we decided to
do it this time

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.110 align:middle line:84%
because I'm at the
point in my life

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:90%
where I'm tired of holding back.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let the world
know there's a better way

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:90%
to do dentistry.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is the better way.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And you're only one
of two of these biocompatibility

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.380 align:middle line:90%
labs--

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: That is true.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.513 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --in the
world, or in the country?

00:39:13.513 --> 00:39:14.872 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: In the country.

00:39:14.872 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:84%
To be honest with
you, I'm not sure

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.060 align:middle line:84%
if there are any other labs
in other countries that do it.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so, because we
receive tests from dentists

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.630 align:middle line:90%
in other countries.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So do most
people not even know

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.770 align:middle line:90%
what goes in their fillings?

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Most people have no
clue what the dentist has just

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.270 align:middle line:90%
put in their mouth.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And most
people don't even ask.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: And most
people don't even ask.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How should
people go about finding

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:90%
the right dentist?

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRUBE: Goggle it, or Google--
as Dr. Hal Huggins would

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:90%
say, goggle it, or Google it.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:45.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:50.293 align:middle line:84%
Put in-- Google "biological
dentists in my area."

00:39:50.293 --> 00:39:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: That's
one of the things

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that I always say as well-- just
ask questions and research it.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Mm-hmm.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I think people are
just not doing enough research

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.140 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.417 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's easy
for us to say, when

00:40:01.417 --> 00:40:03.500 align:middle line:84%
we want to get something
done, we do the research,

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.160 align:middle line:84%
or something's going on with
us that's not comfortable--

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:06.452 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:40:06.452 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: --we do the research
and we find solutions.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But most people out there
just go to their local dentist

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.350 align:middle line:90%
or go to their local doctor.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRUBE: Right.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What advice would you
give somebody that's suffering

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:21.170 align:middle line:84%
or that has mercury
amalgams in their mouth?

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
A message that you would like
to tell them to give them

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.760 align:middle line:90%
hope, to give them faith?

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.130 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUBE: I would say,
first, go to your physician

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and see what the physician
can-- first do the testing

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.380 align:middle line:10%
to see if it's mercury issue.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, second, the
physician can give you

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.380 align:middle line:84%

because if I don't have
that I have nothing.

your health, you have nothing.
