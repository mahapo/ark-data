00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
There is a reason

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.430 align:middle line:84%
that Eastern medicine has
found a place in the West.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Western diagnostic
techniques are simply not

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:84%
adequate when trying to
decipher the source of most

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.465 align:middle line:90%
chronic illness.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:84%
If you can't find
the source, you

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:90%
don't know what you're treating.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And thus, you're stuck
with throwing palliatives

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:90%
at the problem.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:84%
David Scrimgeour was on
his way to medical school

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:84%
when his life took
an abrupt turn,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:84%
literally-- he
ended up in Taiwan,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
where he was exposed
to acupuncture

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and other Asian medical
modalities, which changed

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:90%
the direction of his life.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
He joins us today to speak about
the complexities of diagnosis,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:84%
adrenal burnout, and other
challenges to Western medicine.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you
could join us here.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
These are problems that
pretty much everybody,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
either if they don't have
some adrenal burnout issues,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:84%
misdiagnoses, chronic
illness anymore,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
then they're probably not
living and breathing or over

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:90%
40 years old.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.503 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID SCRIMGEOUR: Pretty much.

00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I mean, you can
die from adrenal burnout,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:10%
so it's an important topic.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Launch into it because you
have a lot to say about it.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: I do have a lot
to say about it, and part of it

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:10%
is because I've seen so
much of it over the years

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:10%
and I think I have felt it in
my own ways, as so many of us

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:10%
have, and it prompted
me to figure out

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:10%
what's going on here.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.803 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine, of course,
is a great reference for it,

00:01:24.803 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
even though we don't
call it by the same name.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
We call it kidney deficiency
in Chinese medicine.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:84%
They've mapped this out
a long, long time ago

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and said, well,
here's what happens.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
If you really get overburdened--
and they use this term "yali,"

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.277 align:middle line:84%
which means pressure
in Chinese--

00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
if you get overburdened
by different things,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.735 align:middle line:84%
and they really listed it-- they
talk about the seven emotions,

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
any kind of excess they say will
really create this imbalance

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
in the system which leads to
this concept of deficiency.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big differences
in terms of, I would say,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Western thinking in
terms of medicine

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and Eastern thinking
in terms of medicines

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:84%
is this whole concept
of deficiency,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:90%
which is lacking in something.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we could look at that
and think, well, it's cortisol.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Or we can look at
that and think it's

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
some disease, some
genetic-type situation where

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
there's a true deficiency, or
we could think thyroid hormone.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But we're not talking
about that necessarily.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, we talked earlier
about this balance thing,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
where when you get out of
balance, what starts happening,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
or you just get,
let's say, rundown

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:90%
in the early phases of this.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But then as that progresses,
as you sort of ignore that--

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
biggest issues for people

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.702 align:middle line:84%
is kind of what you
were just saying,

00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
it's ignoring what's
actually happening.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So we think that the world we
live in, it's just all fine,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.833 align:middle line:90%
and we're the problem.

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not the world, but we
just have to adapt to it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So we basically
have to speed up.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a good example
of this is ADD in kids.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I grew up, I
never heard of ADD in kids.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It was like some kids got
it, and some kids didn't.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
some kids, you just said

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:90%
they had ants in their pants.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Or something.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, that was it.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: But it
was never like now.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:10%
Now you have a
disease, and you have

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:10%
to be medicated for it, which
is not even to sedate you,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:10%
which is the most
shocking thing of all.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:10%
It's to speed you up.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:10%
It's speed.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:10%
The stuff is speed.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Exactly.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ritalin.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Literally.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So in Chinese
medicine, we actually

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:90%
treat that differently.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
We actually calm things
down to treat that,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:90%
and it works just as well.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just that things are
kind of out of rhythm,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and so things aren't
functioning right.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
You can either speed it up,
or you can slow it down.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.357 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now,
when someone says--

00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
continue on that track,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
but you're spurring a
question in my mind.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
If they're giving
speed, essentially--

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
you know methamphetamine
or speed--

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to people with ADD in
the form of Ritalin,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:84%
is it in a sense,
like cures like?

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.407 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can giving
a hyperactive child--

00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
how does that respond
to something that is--

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Well, over time,
it doesn't respond well at all.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.197 align:middle line:84%
It creates a different
type of burnout

00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:84%
is really the thing because
you're speeding it up,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what I'm saying.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole issue with
any of these types of things.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's how do you
want to look at things?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.677 align:middle line:84%
How do you want to look at
what's the root of the problem?

00:03:49.677 --> 00:03:51.975 align:middle line:84%
Is the problem the
kid who can't keep up?

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Or is the problem what he's
trying to keep up with,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:90%
which is completely-- who knows?

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:84%
What have we created in
terms of what it is that--

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, don't get me
going on our educational system.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course these
kids can't keep up.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: And part
of me, I almost want

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
to jump ahead, because if
you don't, you can't really

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
answer the question, which is,
what's the purpose of life?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: And honestly, I
know that sounds like-- ugh.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:84%
In Western medicine, it's kind
of like, we don't go there.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:10%
But it's like, that's the
problem because you've

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:10%
got to know what
the purpose of life

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:10%
is, and here you are
dealing with life,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:10%
in a sense trying
to solve problems,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:10%
trying to cure something,
trying to bring people back

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:10%
to this homeostasis, trying to
bring people back for as long

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:10%
as they can live--

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.683 align:middle line:10%
as long as they can exist
and breathe, that is--

00:04:31.683 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:10%
that we need to
ask that question.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:10%
And so to me, that's
essential to the whole thing

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:10%
because if you don't really
know what am I doing here--

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.405 align:middle line:10%
what am I supposed to be doing?

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so that
is a big problem.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
the typical client that

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:10%
walks through your door.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.837 align:middle line:84%
I assume your clientele skews
more female, or does it?

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Pretty much.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.837 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Pretty much?

00:04:48.837 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yes
and no, but yeah.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: On the adrenal
burnout question,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:10%
what is the typical profile
that walks through the door.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: OK, I had a
woman come in the other day,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and she said, I have
adrenal burnout.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how do you know
you have adrenal burnout, first

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.682 align:middle line:84%
of all, because she
had been tested for it.

00:05:01.682 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I've had
this many times, which

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.005 align:middle line:90%
I start thinking, many times?

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Many times?

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: You know, probably
it never really got fixed.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, you've never
really cured that issue.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And she started telling
me the whole thing.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I think she has, I don't
know, one kid or two kids.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:90%
She's a mother.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:10%
She doesn't really have to
work, although she had this job,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:10%
and she really got into it.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And she would tell
me, well, then I just

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
started pushing and pushing
and pushing and pushing

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and pushing, and I can't stop.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And I really get into it,
and I really wire myself up

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
thinking I need to
do all these things,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish all these things--

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.323 align:middle line:84%
never stopping to ask,
well, you know, why?

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that people come in

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:84%
for, it's not usually-- they
don't label it themselves,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:90%
adrenal burnout.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:90%
They label it insomnia.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.562 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, insomnia
but also exhaustion.

00:05:48.562 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Well, exhaustion,
but they go together.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.662 align:middle line:10%
But the insomnia is not--

00:05:52.662 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:10%
again, there's stages of
how all this stuff develops,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:10%
like all these other
things, as they worsen.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But one of the worst stages
is when people can't sleep.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about the
four stages, just briefly

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
so we know how to recognize it.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: The early stage
is typically people just

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.863 align:middle line:10%
don't-- it's all
about adaptation.

00:06:08.863 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back to the real
early one, the initial book,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.983 align:middle line:84%
this guy Hans Selye, a
doctor from Eastern Europe,

00:06:13.983 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:90%
it was actually in the '30s.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:10%
The book was actually
written in, I think, 1956.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.558 align:middle line:84%
It was called "The
Stress of Life."

00:06:18.558 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of outlines
this whole thing

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
of what he examined--
most in mice and rats--

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
but it was this whole idea
of here's what happens.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
If you subject an
animal to stress,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:90%
here's what will happen.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So there will be a
little bit of a breakdown

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.933 align:middle line:84%
in the system initially,
and they'll get sick a lot.

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Like if there are things
around, their immune system

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:90%
They get a little bit tired.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
You're just malfunctioning
a little bit.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not too bad.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.855 align:middle line:84%
Second phase, they
actually start

00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to adapt even
better because it's

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
like there's something
in the system that goes,

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.062 align:middle line:90%
aha, we can figure this out.

00:06:46.062 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Now we know what to do.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But what it does, it
starts putting out

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.825 align:middle line:84%
things like hormones-- certain
types of hormones, usually

00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:84%
cortisol, norepinephrine,
and other types of things

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.272 align:middle line:84%
that really, in a sense,
keep the system going.

00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little
bit of an adaptation.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
bit of a trade-off,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:90%
but you don't notice it so much.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.892 align:middle line:84%
So then everything will
kind of come back to almost

00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:90%
what looks like normal.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you were
paying attention,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
what would that
trade-off look like?

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: I think
the trade-off would

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:10%
be that you start to
notice that you're actually

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:10%
getting a little bit
wired, and that's

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.157 align:middle line:10%
what I've seen with people.

00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Here's the beauty of
using Chinese medicine,

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:90%
you can feel it in the pulse.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.392 align:middle line:90%
It's what we call wiry pulse.

00:07:15.392 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, huh,
you feel really good,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.970 align:middle line:84%
but your pulse says that
you're actually kind of--

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:90%
you're wired up.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not good.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:90%
You're out of balance.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't really feel healthy.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.765 align:middle line:84%
Other little things
will be digestion.

00:07:25.765 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:90%
This comes up all the time.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I got a little bit of stuff.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I have a little
bit of acid reflux.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, why do you
have acid reflux?

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, sure, diet.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But just in terms
of intrinsically,

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with
this acid thing,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:90%
this thing that's in a sense--

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is huge.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: --it's
a heat element.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I see people
at Costco taking home

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.867 align:middle line:10%
these monstrous
containers of Tums.

00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, god, you're
going to eat all of those?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: That stuff's
not that hard to cure.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.375 align:middle line:10%
But again, that's
still an early phase.

00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:51.000 align:middle line:84%
There's an adaptation,
and maybe you're

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
still going to have
some of these symptoms,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:90%
but they're fairly mild.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.117 align:middle line:84%
As you start getting into,
let's say, phase three,

00:07:56.117 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:84%
then you start to notice
these sleep disturbances.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:90%
And these are not good.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.325 align:middle line:84%
So maybe even in
phase two, we'll

00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:02.747 align:middle line:84%
start to have difficulty
falling asleep.

00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:90%
What is it that's affecting you?

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's usually performance.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
It's usually some
kind of anxiety

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:90%
about I need to do more.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:90%
I need to do better.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:90%
It's my job.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:90%
It's usually my job.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.993 align:middle line:84%
It's job and money
are the big things.

00:08:11.993 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are the
ones that get everybody.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: In a down economy,
of course, it is epidemic.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Oh,
yeah, it's even more.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:10%
And relationship stuff, more
for women than men, I think.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:10%
But it's just these things,
and then, so again, people

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.183 align:middle line:10%
are lying there, and
they can't fall asleep.

00:08:24.183 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, they fall asleep.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's stage three?

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.062 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: That's kind of--
we're going from two to three.

00:08:29.062 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
In three, what starts
to happen now is really

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:90%
you're not doing so well.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:90%
You're not adapting very well.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Now what's happening
is you don't sleep.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.490 align:middle line:84%
You fall asleep because
you're so exhausted

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.900 align:middle line:84%
because you're doing this
[MIMICS WHEELS SPINNING]----

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
you're doing this whole
adaptation response to all

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
the stresses that
are coming at you.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And you're trying to catch up.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to stay
up with all that stuff,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:90%
but you can't really.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And again, I have to
emphasize this whole point.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Is it you?

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Or is it the situation?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.032 align:middle line:84%
Is it the crazy world that
we live in, god forbid?

00:08:57.032 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Or is it you that you
just can't keep up?

00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.072 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that that's
important is because then we

Fear really starts to kick
in, but it's still subtle,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:90%
and you don't want to admit it.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:84%

>>SCRIMGEOUR: Right.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:10%
The biggest thing is you
don't want to be aware of it

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:10%
because it's like, well,
that means I'm weak.

you're out of touch with nature.

what to tell you-- you know,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even when you
don't have the resources.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yes, and
that's where it all

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
starts to fail because now,
when you get to this point of I

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.710 align:middle line:90%
can't sleep, people go crazy.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what do you
think the number

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:90%
one medication is that people--

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:90%
I think there were--

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sleeping aids.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: --last year,
60 million prescriptions

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
were filled for sleeping pills,
pharmaceutical sleeping pills.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
[WINCES] So what's
happening here?

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.692 align:middle line:90%
This is epidemic.

00:10:24.692 --> 00:10:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's 60
million that just

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:90%
went and got the medication.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't know about all the
other people that are going,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't need the medication.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, you don't
know about the people who

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:10%
are self-medicating too and
taking over-the-counter stuff.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Exactly.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Benadryl.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Or just
not dealing with it.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:10%
Or just getting depressed and
anxious and everything else,

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.768 align:middle line:10%
which are also the
other big things

00:10:38.768 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:10%
that people get treated for.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So it creates this
whole situation

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:84%
that is really difficult
to solve because you're not

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:84%
solving the root of
the problem, and it

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:90%
gets worse and worse and worse.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And the whole thing is--

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.547 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
stage four in a sense,

00:10:49.547 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
but it's really what
we would call you're

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:90%
knocking on death's door.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But most people
don't really go there

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:90%
because something happens.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
thing that I think

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.545 align:middle line:84%
is so important that
people don't understand,

00:10:59.545 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and Western medicine doesn't
help in the situation

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
because there's no concept
of how to restore balance

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.075 align:middle line:84%
to the system, there's
no concept at all

00:11:08.075 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
of how to strengthen
this system,

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's really no
understanding of how

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.425 align:middle line:84%
to take someone back-- back
to this thing of balance.

00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, way down
the line here,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:90%
you're way out of balance.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:90%
How do we bring you back?

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
is a lot of people,

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
now the genetics kick in.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have
autoimmune disease,

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and now your, in a sense,
resistance defenses are down.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Your core has become weak.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Now the genetics kick in--

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:32.930 align:middle line:90%
bang.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Some of it is--

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
you can look at it.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.107 align:middle line:90%
It's not all random.

00:11:37.107 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
You could say, well,
yeah, genetically

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:90%
you were predisposed.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but if everything
was working fine,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:90%
you may not get this.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:90%
You may not manifest--

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
the DNA may not
manifest in that.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
Bruce Lipton's work--

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:10%
I mean, certainly we
can point to that.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Absolutely.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:10%
And I tell people this all
the time, yes, it can change.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.620 align:middle line:10%
If you do the right
things, you can change it.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So again, we get to
this point where now we

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:84%
start manifesting
chronic illness, whatever

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:90%
your genetics are.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.172 align:middle line:90%
It can be cancer.

00:12:00.172 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:90%
It can be autoimmune disease.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:90%
It's bad stuff.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And people think, yeah, but
what's the cure for cancer?

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.712 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wear a pink
ribbon, get lots of money,

00:12:06.712 --> 00:12:08.338 align:middle line:84%
and throw money at
research for drugs.

00:12:08.338 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's treatment.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.108 align:middle line:90%
That's not cure.

00:12:11.108 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:90%
That's not the cure for cancer.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, it's how can you
prevent that from happening?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
How can you, in a sense,
turn off these influences

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:90%
that we've all bought into?

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a big, big,
big, big question.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's much deeper
than adrenal burnout,

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and that a lot of people
are suffering from it,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.543 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very, very happy that I
feel like Chinese medicine can

00:12:27.543 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:84%
help with that, and I love
helping people with that.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.835 align:middle line:10%
But just to understand,
this is deep stuff, guys.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:84%
This is not some little, tiny
thing that just went wrong.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.918 align:middle line:84%
This is something
where it's like, uh-oh.

00:12:36.918 --> 00:12:38.377 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And to
get there you have

00:12:38.377 --> 00:12:40.730 align:middle line:10%
to have missed every cue
for a long period of time,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:10%
pretty much, right?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Well, you
have to override it.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you missed it,
but you had to override it.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's a
good way of saying it.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: And that's
what I think people do.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.577 align:middle line:90%
And I ask people that.

00:12:48.577 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:90%
I say, how did you--

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:90%
you're sacrificing your life.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:90%
For who?

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.802 align:middle line:84%
For a corporation that
chews you up, spits you out,

00:12:56.802 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't really
care when you're done?

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just the way it is.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just America.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.917 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the place.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:90%
But that's a lot of what it is--

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
for money, fame, for
some other person?

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like our values, it's
just all whacked out, to me.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is what-- but again,
I see how this manifests.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and your clients,

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:90%
you have to talk to them about--

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR:
That's what I mean.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --these values
to get going, yeah.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yeah, it's
not a personal thing.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.490 align:middle line:10%
It's just this is
what I observe.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.115 align:middle line:10%
And I ask them, well,
what's the issue?

00:13:21.115 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:10%
It's always these things.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:10%
Well, I got divorced, so now
I'm not totally stressed out,

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.772 align:middle line:10%
and now I don't know
how I'm going to live.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's all hooked
in to this whole thing.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.425 align:middle line:10%
And again, even in terms
of just economically,

00:13:32.425 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:10%
there are different
ways of doing

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:10%
that and different systems where
people take care of each other.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have
a very good system,

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel, in the West and
certainly in this country.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.657 align:middle line:84%
We don't have extended
families anymore.

00:13:40.657 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are just a lot of
systems that we don't have that

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
were there-- community support
systems that we don't have--

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and they're really,
really important.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.985 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So that
has to be number one.

00:13:49.985 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:10%
When you're looking at
starting to recover a person,

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:10%
or find this the state of
homeostasis or balance again,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't having
communal support--

00:13:59.360 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: It
would be really good.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --really
be intrinsic to it?

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: I don't
know if it would be first.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.535 align:middle line:84%
It would be if we
could get them there.

00:14:03.535 --> 00:14:05.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just to have
a good friend there

00:14:05.285 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:90%
for you or a family member.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yeah.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about how one can

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:90%
start rebuilding that balance.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.025 align:middle line:84%
If you've, say, gotten
to stage three of this,

00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:90%
where you're not sleeping--

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Which is
the most common, yeah.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --very common.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Those are most
of the people that I see.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, before
it manifests in really

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:10%
life-threatening diseases.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: They have
to feel really bad usually

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.233 align:middle line:84%
before they show up, which means
they're not sleeping anymore,

00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and their digestion
is usually off,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and for women, the
hormones are really off.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
For men it can be too,
but for women, it's

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
usually the hormones are
off, and so nothing works.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And there are all these
psycho-emotional things

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:90%
that go with it.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
There's almost always some level
of anxiety and/or depression,

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.607 align:middle line:84%
almost always, that
goes with all of that.

00:14:38.607 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So how do we fix it,
is really the question.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.815 align:middle line:84%
So people come in, and it's
like, OK, I just try to talk.

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:90%
First, how'd you get here?

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think you
can do to change that?

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.493 align:middle line:84%
It's not like everyone can
go and quit their jobs,

00:14:48.493 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:84%
but some people need to, or
they need to change it in a way

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that they feel they
are not completely

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.267 align:middle line:84%
succumbing to forces around them
that they have no control over.

00:14:57.267 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's the whole issue in
terms of what stress really

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.683 align:middle line:90%
is, and that's what it is.

00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:03.025 align:middle line:84%
If you feel you have some
control over your environment,

00:15:03.025 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
over what's
happening to you, you

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.620 align:middle line:84%
can make a lot of these
changes on your own.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So the lifestyle
thing is part of it.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:10%
I have to encourage people,
inspire people, motivate

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.605 align:middle line:10%
people, understand
people in that way

00:15:13.605 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:10%
to sort of bring them out of
that-- usually it's despair.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:90%
They don't even see it.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Most people are so freaked out
when they're in this state,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:90%
it's just like, help me--

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:90%
It's dramatic.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.495 align:middle line:84%
It's like a panic attack, but
it's going on all the time.

00:15:25.495 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a chronic panic attack.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:10%
So I do simple little things.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:10%
One of the first things
I do is I will give them

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:10%
things, like herbs,
that help strengthen

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:10%
the system because
this is very real,

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:10%
and you can measure this
in terms of cortisol.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:90%
This is deficiency.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Usually, there is an imbalance
and a deficiency of cortisol,

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
meaning the whole
circadian rhythm is

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:90%
completely out of balance.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going high in the
morning and low at night,

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:84%
which is nice and normal-- it's
just like the sun comes out

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:90%
and the--

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:90%
it's not like that.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's like
this, or it will

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:84%
be high at night,
which is usually

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
the thing with the sleep thing
because the cortisol is going,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I have to stay awake
because I don't

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
know what's going to happen
to me, and if I fall asleep,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.008 align:middle line:84%
I'll never wake up,
and I'm going to die,

00:16:01.008 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and something's going to
happen, and I won't be awake.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:90%
So you stay awake.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't blame it, the body.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just trying to respond.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's in panic.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: It's
trying to survive.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly,
it's trying to survive.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:10%
So what kind of herbs
are you looking at?

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.510 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Oh, I
give people most-- these

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle line:10%
are like the adaptogenic herbs.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:10%
We don't call them that
in Chinese medicine.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
tonifying herbs.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about adaptogens.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: The
biggest one is ginseng.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:90%
We use astragalus.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I want
to say something.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yeah?

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right now, if
someone's listening to this,

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
they'll think, but
ginseng's an upper.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Why would you give
someone ginseng?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: No,
it's not an upper.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really
misunderstood.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, I
know it is, and that's

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:90%
why I want you to talk about it.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.072 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR:
Ginseng-- and again, we

00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
don't use this term adaptogen,
but even earlier today, I

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:90%
was looking at this book.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at ginseng,
and I was like, OK,

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
what does it say clinically
that they do with ginseng?

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Well they'll use it when
people are really fatigued

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and burned-- all these things
that we're talking about is

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
sort of a classic
example of it--

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:84%
but they also use it
to help moderate things

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
like palpitations and
high blood pressure.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just a funny thing.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, for certain
people, in other words,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
if your blood pressure
is really low,

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
it will actually
help to bring it up.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that it typically
brings up somebody's blood

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:84%
who already has
high blood pressure.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.305 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
that it wants to--

00:17:04.305 --> 00:17:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Find equilibrium.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Exactly.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why it's
called an "adapt-o-gen," right?

00:17:08.244 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Absolutely,
but with the underlying

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.986 align:middle line:10%
energetic of it that
it's strengthening.

00:17:13.986 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:90%
Because again, if this adrenal--

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.652 align:middle line:84%
if our core is weak, we need
something to strengthen it.

00:17:17.652 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
There is no concept
in Western medicine

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.742 align:middle line:90%
of strengthening anything.

00:17:20.742 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not just giving you
cortisol or giving you

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:90%
some form of cortisone, really.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's really something
else because we're talking

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.083 align:middle line:90%
about something different.

00:17:27.083 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:10%
This person has the
ability to do this,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:10%
to produce this cortisol,
but it's not happening

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:10%
because they've used it up.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
So they've burned it out.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So the term, it's
accurate in that sense.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.237 align:middle line:10%
You've actually literally,
spun those wheels so much,

00:17:41.237 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:10%
created so much friction--

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: So now you're
introducing the adaptogens,

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:10%
ginseng--

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.897 align:middle line:10%
what else?

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Astragalus
is a wonderful one.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So that's where
the astragalus comes in, OK.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.737 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Astragalus
is really cool.

00:17:49.737 --> 00:17:52.737 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I'm using it now in
this concentration of 50 to 1

00:17:52.737 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:10%
because there's a
lot of research done

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.610 align:middle line:10%
on astragalus and telomeres.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.100 align:middle line:10%
Telomeres is a whole other
thing about anti-aging.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:10%
And so the idea is this.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:10%
If the telomeres, as we age--

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.167 align:middle line:10%
not even as we
age, but as we get

00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:10%
influenced by a number
of different things--

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:10%
they shorten.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't want that.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So if they're not replicating,
then basically we're

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.700 align:middle line:90%
getting older faster.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.907 align:middle line:90%
So it's called the--

00:18:11.907 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cellular deaths.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR:
Exactly, senescence

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.243 align:middle line:10%
or the death of the cell.

00:18:15.243 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea is that we can
stimulate that to happen again.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:90%
So the research that was done--

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
actually by one of my mentors,
people that he works with--

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.495 align:middle line:84%
on astragalus because
they were looking

00:18:24.495 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
for a particular aspect of
astragalus that would do that,

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:90%
they found that it did that.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.997 align:middle line:84%
It will get the
telomeres growing again

00:18:29.997 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:90%
in certain concentrations.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: It's fascinating--

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't know
that about astragalus.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.660 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR:
--really fascinating.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Fabulous.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: So that's
part of the reason

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:10%
that in Chinese medicine,
when you look back

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:10%
at why did they think
this stuff is so cool?

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And then now we can apply
these sort of modern ways

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:90%
of analyzing and go, whoa.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's very cool.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yeah, some of this
anti-aging stuff is for real.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.932 align:middle line:84%
And if we're talking about
turning on telomeres--

00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:53.557 align:middle line:84%
and again, some of the fear was,
well, would you create cancer?

00:18:53.557 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't do that.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these herbal
things, they don't do that.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like food.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:84%
If it's a good, whole
food, it doesn't do that.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't get
these side effects.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so we have
ginseng and astragalus.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Ginseng and
astragalus, Reishi, which is--

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reishi mushroom.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: --really
well known in Asia.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.147 align:middle line:84%
Reishi comes from
Japan and China.

00:19:10.147 --> 00:19:10.980 align:middle line:10%
We use that as well.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot of emphasis
on that in terms of cancer

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:10%
because it stimulates-- if you
really get into the research

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:10%
on these things,
which some people--

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:10%
it's all in PubMed.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.537 align:middle line:84%
It's all over the
place now because it's

00:19:19.537 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
become very popular in terms
of looking for alternatives,

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:90%
mostly for things like cancer.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But how can you actually
stimulate the immune system

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.138 align:middle line:84%
to respond to these things
that are overwhelming it?

00:19:30.138 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, the question
is, what are those things

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
because some of them
are just stress,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but there are different
types of stresses,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:90%
whether they're environmental.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Toxicity is a huge issue.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
huge issue, yeah.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: But
we want to deal

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:84%
with things that actually
bring our defense system up

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:90%
against that.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.827 align:middle line:84%
So Reishi is one
of those things.

00:19:44.827 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them has
very different properties

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.618 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how they
affect immune system

00:19:48.618 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:84%
through the thymus, through the
T cells, through the B cells.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's pretty
incredible stuff.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It'll stimulate
certain cytokines

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
to have certain reactions
against certain pathogens

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:90%
that are coming in.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.105 align:middle line:84%
So those are some of
the things we use.

00:20:00.105 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Some of the other ones--

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.178 align:middle line:90%
those are the big ones.

00:20:02.178 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I would say, ginseng,
astragalus, Reishi.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Cordyceps is a really old one,
which is kind of a strange one.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a larva.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
We call it [CHINESE] in Chinese,
which means "winter worm summer

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:84%
grass," because it's actually
this kind of larva that

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.792 align:middle line:90%
grows in the spring.

00:20:17.792 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there are all
these strange things in--

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's ground up larva.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yeah, pretty much.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, gotcha.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: [LAUGHS]

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: All right, cordyceps.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: We use these
things in Chinese medicine

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:10%
that they didn't
care what it is.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.980 align:middle line:10%
They just care what
the effect was.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.783 align:middle line:90%
And so that's one that we use.

00:20:30.783 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
other ones that we put--

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:90%
even licorice is actually--

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.932 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are
there compounds that

00:20:34.932 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:84%
are made that people can use
for restoring the adrenals?

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've seen a lot of--

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: There
are a number of things.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --adrenal
support things,

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:90%
even in the health food store.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Oh,
there are a lot

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:90%
of things that are out there.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it is the potency.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we want to be
looking for these things?

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Those
types of things.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The potencies are
really, really important

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:84%
in terms of people accessing
that kind of stuff.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Usually, you're
going to do better

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
going to someone who's a
practitioner because they're

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.237 align:middle line:84%
going to have a lot more
experience with that stuff.

00:20:55.237 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I recently made
a formula for my patients

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and for me because
I wanted to combine

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle line:84%
all those things in there and
have a real high concentration

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:90%
of the astragalus.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to put the
cordyceps in there.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to put all these
things in there that I

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:90%
think are things that really--

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:90%
I put Schisandra in there.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I put the Lycium,
which is like--

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
which helps us sleep.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yeah,
the goji berries.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.160 align:middle line:10%
There's a little story
in China, the guy who

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:10%
lived to be 212 eating
nothing but goji berries.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.967 align:middle line:10%
You know, there's
stuff like this,

00:21:17.967 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:10%
but the anti-aging aspect of it.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:10%
So you want a very
balanced formula,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.998 align:middle line:10%
but you want these
things to be strong.

00:21:23.998 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:84%
You want them to
really do something.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.915 align:middle line:84%
There's another
great herb called

00:21:26.915 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Rehmannia, which is
not often used in terms

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.352 align:middle line:90%
of these classic forms.

00:21:30.352 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a little hard to digest.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:90%
It's really thick.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of, we would say,
kidney deficiency classically

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese medicine, it's a
really, really common herb.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let
me ask you about that.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about how
it's called kidney deficiency.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yes.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the adrenals sit
on top of the kidneys.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Is there a relationship that--

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.383 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Absolutely.

00:21:47.383 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So really, we are
talking about adrenal burnout,

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.342 align:middle line:84%
but what's happening
with the kidneys

00:21:51.342 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that they're sitting on top
of that would maybe even be

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:90%
a precursor?

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Well, the thing
is you can't necessarily

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.953 align:middle line:84%
make an exact
correlation between what

00:21:58.953 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:84%
we call kidney deficiency
in Chinese medicine,

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
or even adrenal burnout,
and kidney organ

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
function in Western anatomical
physiological medicine

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:90%
because it's different.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.487 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it doesn't
mean you actually have a kidney

00:22:10.487 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:90%
problem at all, necessarily.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So what we assign to
this kidney deficiency

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.573 align:middle line:84%
is really more of an
energetic, symptomatic way

00:22:19.573 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of looking at that, of
measuring what that is.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So for example, people
might have back pain.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:90%
They might have knee pain.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:90%
They might have tooth problems.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, lower back pain
is like almost endemic to--

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: It's
endemic, absolutely--

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:10%
ear problems, with hearing
things, tinnitus, you know,

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:10%
hear loss.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.788 align:middle line:10%
All these things we relate
to kidney, but also things

00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:36.714 align:middle line:10%
like willpower we
relate to kidney,

00:22:36.714 --> 00:22:38.506 align:middle line:10%
which is another one
that people experience

00:22:38.506 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:10%
when they're burnt out.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well now,
see this is a big one--

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Lack of.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --lack of willpower.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:10%
Interesting.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:10%
So really, it's the
whole person and spirit

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:10%
that we're looking at here.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, I want to
get to this subject

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
because people will
have to read books.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:90%
They'll have to find you.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
But we have so much
more we can talk about,

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and we only have about
five minutes left.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:90%
So now someone has taken it on.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
They're going to embrace some of
the healing forms of exercise,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:90%
such as yoga.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.535 align:middle line:84%
And I ask you this for
a reason because yoga,

00:23:08.535 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:84%
when I started doing
yoga about 30 years ago,

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:84%
it was just people in
T-shirts and Hatha yoga,

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:90%
and it was rather gentle.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm terrified to go
into most yoga classes--

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just on a
performance level

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:90%
alone and the amount of stress.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you go into Bikram,
the amount of heat.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And I see a lot of people, women
in particular, that have now

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:84%
embraced the yogic lifestyle,
that are rail thin,

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and they're not appearing to
me to be a whole lot happier

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
than they were before, although
they were dealing with burnout

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:90%
issues perhaps and others.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.840 align:middle line:90%
And we're in Boulder.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:90%
This is like a yoga capital.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:90%
And I love yoga.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful healing
modality and art,

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:84%
but what happens when they
end up in your office weighing

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.060 align:middle line:90%
100 pounds?

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Well,
that's a big question,

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.775 align:middle line:90%
and that's a lot to take on.

00:23:56.775 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm
seeing a lot of it.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:10%
That's why I'm
asking because that's

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:10%
like you're now burning
out in another direction,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:10%
trying to heal yourself.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Part of it
is cultural, the extremes.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:84%
If a little bit is good,
a whole lot is better,

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.783 align:middle line:84%
and that's kind of where
a lot of that comes from.

00:24:08.783 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm a little
bit healthy, maybe I

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
can be extremely healthy,
which leads to an imbalance.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, Chinese medicine--
extreme yin turns to yang.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Extreme yang turns to yin.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So this case, extreme
yang, meaning overdoing it,

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
pushing your body
so far that it turns

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to yin in this state, which is
more of the deficient state.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.805 align:middle line:84%
In that respect,
that's what happens.

00:24:26.805 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So if that's what
you're asking--

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
depleting yourself?

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Absolutely.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:90%
People just overdo it.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:31.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just like anything.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:90%
It's like an eating disorder.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I really
want to be strong and healthy

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
and we can see how

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:10%
marathoners-- it's
like, jeez, you're

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:10%
going to do that, of
course, you're going

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:10%
to start depleting yourself.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: So
an ultra marathon

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:10%
would be even better, right?

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: An ultra marathon?

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.235 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Because
if I can run 100 miles,

00:24:43.235 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:10%
then it means something.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:10%
We don't know what.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But then
you think of yoga.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:10%
It's so gentle.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:90%
How can you do that?

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Yeah,
it's a beautiful thing.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you can really
burn out, even on yoga.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.290 align:middle line:90%
And so this whole thing--

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Cultural.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then again--

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Hollywood.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.917 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --this gets
us into Hollywood.

00:24:54.917 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It gets us into discussions
about self-worth,

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:84%
our sexuality, our desirability,
and everything else.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a really,
really big topic.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to just
kind of end that at that

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.082 align:middle line:90%
for the moment.

00:25:10.082 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:10%
At another time, I would love
for you to come back and talk

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:10%
a little bit more about
those kinds of cycles

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.302 align:middle line:10%
because you really do address
it from the spirit to the cell.

00:25:19.302 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:10%
But in the interim, we still
have a couple of minutes left.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So while we're talking
about this adrenal burnout,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.242 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about
some of the herbs.

00:25:25.242 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about prioritizing
our energy and our time.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Talk a little bit more
about this whole notion

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:34.105 align:middle line:84%
of self-respect in
our own recovery.

00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: It's
beyond self-respect.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I think it's self-worth.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I think it's knowing yourself.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know yourself,
that's the problem, to me.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I've
spent many, many years

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.385 align:middle line:84%
examining that and
looking at that,

00:25:46.385 --> 00:25:48.885 align:middle line:84%
doing things like practicing a
particular type of meditation

00:25:48.885 --> 00:25:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that I've done for
many, many years

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to try to find, what
is that within me?

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So if I know what that
is, if I have a reference

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:84%
point within me that's
very, very clear and strong,

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:90%
from that--

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, wisdom--

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:90%
I can apply that out here.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of looking at all
these issues for other people,

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.723 align:middle line:90%
that's also part of the process.

00:26:05.723 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:84%
How can I get a person to, in
a sense, become self-aware?

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:90%
I can't just make them aware.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I have to get them somehow
interested enough in themselves

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
that they want to really
find out what's at their core

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.943 align:middle line:84%
and not to be distracted
away from it by all

00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:19.443 align:middle line:84%
these other issues,
where it's like,

00:26:19.443 --> 00:26:22.020 align:middle line:84%
if I work myself to death,
maybe then I'll find happiness.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.720 align:middle line:84%
If I do something, whatever it
is, become beautiful or this--

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.143 align:middle line:84%
all these extremes that we go
into that we've known forever--

00:26:28.143 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
forever-- that they don't
bring you happiness.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:90%
They don't bring you health.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.915 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it's just
they bring you emptiness.

00:26:33.915 --> 00:26:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it's that
kind of a thing.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:84%
If I can help
somebody to rediscover

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.510 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
actually becoming

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.972 align:middle line:84%
healthy, of nourishing
yourself, because you're right--

00:26:41.972 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:84%
if you feel like I don't have
any reason to nourish myself,

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to do it,
but if you can do that.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense,
it's like, wake up.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is all about
consciousness in the end.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Absolutely.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Self-awareness and
consciousness, and that's

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.500 align:middle line:10%
the journey that has to really
precede all the rest if we're

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.580 align:middle line:10%
truly going to recover.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And David, thank you
so much for your time.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:90%
It's gone by just in a snap.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I love your energy.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: My pleasure.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You don't
appear to be burnt our.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:10%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: I
hope not-- not yet.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No, you're
a joy to be around,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:10%
and I hope to see
you here again.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SCRIMGEOUR: Thank you.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope this has
given you some food for thought

00:27:10.815 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your
own hamster mill.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Prioritizing energy use
is not easy in this world,

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:84%
but it sounds like that may
be our path to salvation

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.547 align:middle line:90%
and happiness once again.

00:27:19.547 --> 00:27:21.630 align:middle line:10%
If you'd like to know more
