00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Many of you
have taken the time to look up

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:84%
in the sky and have become aware
of the phenomena called chem

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:90%
trails.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed the producers
of "What in the World

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
are They Spraying?", Michael
Murphy and G. Edward Griffin,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
as to the chem trails' effect on
people, animal, and plant life.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MICHAEL MURPHY: We now have
a huge major ozone hole above

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:84%
both the Northern and
Southern Hemisphere.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.265 align:middle line:84%
A number of people
now are recognizing

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that they're burning
much quicker in the sun,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and we have documented
cases of our UV going up.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.864 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's a stated
consequence of geoengineers.

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which should be
directly relating to skin

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:90%
cancers as well.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I would think a rise
in skin cancers.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> MURPHY: Which we've seen
is an incredible increase

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.737 align:middle line:84%
in respiratory mortality, which
has gone from number eight down

00:01:16.737 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to number three in
the past six years,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:84%
which geoengineers
deny about that.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
But PH changes in our soil--
and they even state that once,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:84%
if they implement
these programs,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.805 align:middle line:90%
which they already have--

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: If?

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing this
for well over a decade.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MURPHY: Well over a decade.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.974 align:middle line:84%
And they state that it
could disrupt the food

00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:90%
supply of over 2 billion people.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, we're going to
take the conversation further

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:84%
in an interesting direction
into some of the science

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and technologies that may be
neutralizing the chem trails.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
In addition,
researcher and engineer

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Ken Rohla and I
will also discuss

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the most powerful
technology of all

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
in encountering negative impacts
on our health and well being,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's consciousness.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Ken, I'm so happy
to have you here.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Not too long ago, we were
both at the same conference

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
here in Boulder, and I heard
about you after the fact.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.486 align:middle line:84%
I think you kind of
sneaked in under the wire.

00:02:07.486 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And everyone said,
oh my God, you

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:84%
have to hear what
this man has to say.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I couldn't at that
time, so here we are.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, chem
trails, they're there.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
What's more interesting to me
is what we can do about it.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And I really love the
research that you've done,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.324 align:middle line:84%
and also, we have on the table
here a very interesting device.

00:02:29.324 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to get a
little background on you

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
first so that everyone
here will know

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
how you came to create
this, starting back

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.472 align:middle line:84%
with your fascination with
the work of Wilhelm Reich.

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> KEN ROHLA: My whole life,
I've been a troublemaker

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and class clown in school and
always questioned authority.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And really, it was just because
I wanted to understand things.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So all of this has
come from wanting

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to understand reality and
the world and the universe

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and how things work.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And so after about 23
years working in the health

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:84%
industry-- I should say
the medical industry--

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the
shortcomings of that,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
I decided to get
out of all of that,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
get out of the high-technology
work that I was doing,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:90%
and become a potter.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that, became a
potter for about five years,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and in the course of that, wound
up spending some years healing

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
my own body of health
issues using living foods

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:90%
and detoxification.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And so people started
coming to my house

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and asking me, what's
up with the way you live

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and all this living
food stuff and not

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
watching television and this
whole different way of life?

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And after moving
to Florida, I got

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
tired of having two and
three-hour conversations

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
having to explain my
lifestyle to people,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and I was complaining about
it to a friend of mine.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you ought to
do a workshop for your friends

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:90%
and get them off your back.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's a brilliant idea.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So I did a workshop
in teaching about how

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:90%
to heal with living foods.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.569 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, great.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Those people will
leave me alone now.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And instead, what happened
was they went and told people,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:90%
and then I had to do another.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.809 align:middle line:84%
And they went and
told people, and I

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:90%
had to do another and another.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I got deeply
into teaching

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
about healing with
living foods and did

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:90%
that for quite a few years.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so in the course of
that, being an engineer,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
being trained as
an engineer, I've

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
always viewed this as
creating solutions, finding

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:84%
the solutions or else creating
the solutions for myself

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and then sharing it
with other people.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.394 align:middle line:84%
And so probably 10
years ago, I started

00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
seeing people that were
coming to me when they would

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.768 align:middle line:84%
go and get testing showing
up with these heavy metals

00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies-- barium,
strontium, and aluminum.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that came
on my mind was chem trials.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And nobody was talking
about it back then,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
but I was seeing it in the
skies and wondering about it

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.095 align:middle line:84%
and then seeing this in probably
85% of my clients showing up.

00:04:57.095 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it was actually
isolating those particular

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:90%
heavy metals in tests?

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Strontium as well?

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Oh, yeah, those three.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It was always those three.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people always have
other heavy metals, but always

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.420 align:middle line:84%
those three, and I always
wondered why and in such high

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
concentrations and
so consistently.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And also, I started comparing
notes with other friends

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:84%
around the world who
were practitioners,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and they were seeing
the same things

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:90%
showing up in people's bodies.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I suspected
it, and then I

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
started seeing scientific
evidence that there were

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
scientists coming out and
saying, we're seeing this, too.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the "Why in the World?"

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and "What in the World are They
Spraying?' videos came out.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So in the course of all that
in looking for solutions,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I had looked at some technology
that Nikola Tesla had developed

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.996 align:middle line:84%
called a personal oscillator
for destressing people

00:05:44.996 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and getting them
into deep sleep.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I modernized
that technology

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and created this
small device that you

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:90%
can carry with yourself.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it puts out this subtle
energy called skalar waves,

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
so I knew how to create skalar
waves with electronic circuits.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And then it was really when
the Fukushima nuclear disaster

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
happened-- and notice
I didn't say accident--

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.330 align:middle line:84%
but when the nuclear
disaster happened,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.517 align:middle line:84%
the first thing in
my mind was, OK,

00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be a
solution for this.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I had already been
a student of consciousness

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:90%
my entire life.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that whenever
a problem is created,

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
the solutions are always
created simultaneously,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
because that's how the energy
of consciousness works.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And I get into this
a lot about how

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:84%
the physics of consciousness
works and how these polarities

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:84%
of energy, when a
problem is created,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.715 align:middle line:90%
the solution is also created.

00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very important
point to make here.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Very important.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because people
go into fear thinking

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:84%
they're isolated there
with the problem.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Not the case.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.969 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Exactly.

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is
something that I make

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
a point of sharing with
people, not to get in fear.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Because even if it
looks like everything's

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.990 align:middle line:84%
going to hell in a
handbasket, the solutions

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.270 align:middle line:90%
are already out there.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And for the people that choose
them, they'll be just fine.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Forget about anything that
may come down the road.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
If you just look at
what's already occurring,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
people are
self-destructing already

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
with what's going on,
choosing the old paradigm

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:90%
over the new paradigms.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And those people that try
to hang on to the old ways

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.696 align:middle line:90%
are going to self-destruct.

00:07:18.696 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's interesting,
because a lot of people that

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:84%
are in fear regarding these
externals that are coming

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
in at the same time often
will not take or do not choose

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.316 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility on
a much more personal level

00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
for what's happening
to the body.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We can trash this
body so easily.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to look as far
as radiation or chem trails,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:84%
so what you say is
a very good point.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:84%
First, you have to look at
yourself and your own habits.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.395 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: That's very true.

00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And human beings in general
usually won't look at things

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and change until
they've reached a pain

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.451 align:middle line:90%
level that's pretty high.

00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.425 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's continue
with your story then.

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: OK, getting back to
how I discovered this stuff

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:90%
and Reich's technology.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So when the nuclear
disaster hit, I immediately,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.519 align:middle line:84%
knowing that there were
solutions already out there,

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:90%
I started looking around.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.976 align:middle line:84%
I just started
doing some googling

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and immediately
found lots and lots

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
of people developing these
devices called cloudbusters

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
or chem trail busters
using Reich's technology

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
to clear chem trails
and stuff out of the sky

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.900 align:middle line:90%
with varying degrees of success.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it
all and also came

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:84%
across a man named Karl Hans
Welz, who also developed

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
this material based on
Reich's work called orgonite,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
which is basically a
non-conducting resin,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
like fiberglass, with crystals
and minerals and metal powders

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.474 align:middle line:84%
in them doing the
same kinds of things.

00:08:47.474 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at
all of that and said,

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.366 align:middle line:90%
well, I understand it.

00:08:50.366 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And also, I see that the people
who are playing with this stuff

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle line:84%
don't really understand
what's going on with it.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's kind of
regurgitating all of this.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What are you seeing
that is not commonly known

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
by those who follow
the orgonite story?

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, one of the major
things was that what's creating

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:84%
the skalar waves coming off
of these devices is the ORMUS

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:84%
elements or the monoatomic
superconducting minerals

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:84%
in the crystals, in the minerals
that they're using in these

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Crystals have
these minerals that

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:84%
can occur as individual atoms,
rather than normally they

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
are bound together in some
kind of three dimensional grid

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:90%
pattern to make that element.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But certain elements like
the platinum group metals

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and a few others can exist
as individual discrete atoms.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
They're known as
monoatomic elements.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole huge
story about them.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But long story short, they
have very, very weird physics,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:90%
very weird properties.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:90%
And they are hiding.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
like stealth matter.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:84%
They are not true physical,
three dimensional matter.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
They are like this
multi-dimensional or

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:84%
inter-dimensional matter
that exists simultaneously

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
throughout different
frequencies of space and time.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they're kind
of like an iceberg

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:84%
where the tip of the iceberg
is the physical mineral

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that we see, but
the majority of it

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
exists simultaneously in other
dimensions of time and space.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.739 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's
all information.

00:10:12.739 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Right.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you take this
physically, internally,

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, being from Sedona, a lot
of people use monoatomic gold.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, actually,
probably everybody ingests

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:90%
them, because they're in food.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But intentionally ingesting
them-- and I know what you're

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:84%
talking about is man-made
monoatomic minerals--

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I do not do man-made
monoatomic minerals.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.554 align:middle line:84%
I do monoatomic
minerals made by nature,

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I've
been teaching for years.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.845 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
that look like?

00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Fermentation,
photosynthesis,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and certain rocks-- they
naturally create monoatomic

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
elements that the body
can recognize and handle,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and it will only
enhance the body.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these man-made
monoatomic minerals

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
throw the body off, because the
electron spin on them is off,

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.489 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of different
things about their structure

00:11:01.489 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:90%
that can create problems.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, that's
what I've heard.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know which
one you're getting.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Some actually are working
beautifully, and others not.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But I guess you would
tell by the effect.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Exactly, exactly.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the
effects can be subtle

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:84%
until you have a train
wreck or something.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
What they do is
they short circuit

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:84%
the time between thought and
manifestation of thought.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the way they
work when you ingest them

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
in natural states,
they go into the body

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and they plug into the
superconducting junctures

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
throughout the body that are
actually little black holes.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:84%
They're little
singularities, and they're

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:90%
all along the nervous system.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.840 align:middle line:84%
They correspond to the
acupuncture meridians,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
the chakras, the brain
neural pathways, and the DNA.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.060 align:middle line:84%
They're all loaded up with
these superconducting minerals,

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and they are the interface
between consciousness

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and the physical body.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So the more of them that
you have in your body

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
in natural forms, the
faster you can manifest,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.922 align:middle line:84%
the more easily you go
through life, the more aware

00:11:58.922 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
you are, the more connected to
yourself and to other people

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and to nature and
to all of reality

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:84%
you are, the more
compassionate that you are,

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
the more psychic you are,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
But when you ingest them
in these man-made forms,

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.490 align:middle line:84%
typically when they're not in
a form beneficial to the body,

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
they will artificially
shorten that time

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
between thought
and manifestation.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you can wind up creating
a nightmare for yourself.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.579 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like if all your
dreams came true at night,

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't necessarily--

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In an instant.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Right.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't be a pretty picture.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you explain
on your site the difference

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
between the two and how
to create and utilize

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.301 align:middle line:90%
the naturally-occurring ones?

00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:40.425 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: I do extensively.

00:12:40.425 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And In my workshops
and in my talks,

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I do talk a lot about it.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I generally just recommend for
people to make it themselves,

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.984 align:middle line:84%
because they can make
their own for cheap.

00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
do we make ourselves?

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.345 align:middle line:84%
This is preempting the
rest of the conversation,

00:12:51.345 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
but let's go to
this part right now.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.149 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: OK.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, a very simple
thing you can do--

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and the cool thing
about it is it

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of other applications
just besides health--

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
but you can take some microbe
mixtures-- there's one

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.136 align:middle line:90%
called Effective Microorganisms.

00:13:06.136 --> 00:13:07.612 align:middle line:84%
They go by different
brand names.

00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:08.695 align:middle line:90%
I sell them on my website.

00:13:08.695 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is this is like humic
or folvic acid or any of these?

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: You can put humic
and folvic in it and create

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
monoatomics, and humic and
folvic are great to have

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle line:90%
in these mixtures.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But what I teach
people to do is create

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
this ferment, this
fermented brew,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
with this culture of microbes
from this Japanese professor

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:90%
named Teruo Higa.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Effect Microorganisms
is what it's called.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
You mix a quart of that with
a quart of blackstrap molasses

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and five gallons of
water, and then you

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
can throw in mineral powders
that are high ORMUS-bearing

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
mineral powders-- for
example, Azomite, Rhyolite.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a fantastic book called
"The Enlivened Rock Powders"

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.224 align:middle line:90%
by a man named Harvey Lisle.

00:13:50.224 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: "The
Enlivened Rock Powders."

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:52.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing this down.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: "The Enlivened Rock
Powders" by Harvey Lisle.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:84%
You can get that
book, and you can

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
learn about 20
different rock powders

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that you can put
into these brews.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:90%
You can put in herbs.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You can actually custom
make your own brew

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
if you just look
at different herbs

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:90%
and what they're used for.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can
go to herb companies

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.705 align:middle line:84%
and see what they
put in their blends

00:14:15.705 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and just copy what
they're doing.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Throw them into this brew.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can custom
tailor brews for anything

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
from losing weight
to regaining hair

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.107 align:middle line:84%
to whatever, healing
cancer, you name it.

00:14:27.107 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Depending on
the other elements, herbs,

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:90%
and so forth that you put in.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:31.608 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Right, right.

00:14:31.608 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so does
this have to actually brew?

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: It has to brew.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And typically, it takes
three to six months,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
but I know people that
are brewing it for years.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Because you can take,
for example, this brew,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can put the brew
bucket inside of magnets,

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
or you can put magnets
around it or magnetite

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.296 align:middle line:84%
sand, which is a
natural magnetic field.

00:14:50.296 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Put it around the
brew bucket, and that

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
will enhance the creation
of the ORMUS elements.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:90%
That will increase it.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
You can also put the
brew in a skalar field,

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
particularly like orgonite
field or like my devices--

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Near one of these?

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.224 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Yeah,
my power devices.

00:15:04.224 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They will increase the nutrient
levels and the ORMUS levels,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
because it distresses
the microbes.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And then they eat more, and
they make more monoatomics

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.668 align:middle line:84%
and more angstrom minerals
that are small particles.

00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:16.376 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:16.376 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And so then when you
do finally consume it,

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.949 align:middle line:84%
is it just like a
teaspoon or tablespoon?

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: As much as you want.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the beautiful thing.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:90%
You can't hurt yourself.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.501 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: No.

00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a food.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.516 align:middle line:84%
So as long as you don't put
anything in there that's

00:15:28.516 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:84%
toxic-- and
actually, even if you

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:84%
do put some things in
there that are toxic,

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.459 align:middle line:84%
usually these microbes
will them break them down

00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and make them nontoxic.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So don't necessarily
make a cocktail out of it.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.556 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Right, yeah.

00:15:37.556 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you throw herbs and
rock powders and things

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
like that in there,
you're basically

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.608 align:middle line:84%
making this weak vinegar that
tastes kind of like molasses.

00:15:44.608 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's loaded with
probiotics, and it's

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
loaded with monoatomic
and angstrom minerals.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all bioavailable.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you've bought a boatload

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.807 align:middle line:84%
of crappy supplements
that aren't any good,

00:15:54.807 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
you can just throw them in there
and ferment them and rot them

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.639 align:middle line:84%
and break them down, and
they will become bioavailable

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:00.700 align:middle line:90%
completely as well.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.866 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ooh, interesting.

00:16:01.866 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:90%
What about vitamin C?

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: You can
throw all of that in.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because there's a lot
of poor quality vitamin C out

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.066 align:middle line:84%
there that is actually
harming some people.

00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
that can transform it

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.845 align:middle line:84%
into what the true potential
vitamin C should be.

00:16:15.845 --> 00:16:16.803 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Right, right.

00:16:16.803 --> 00:16:17.761 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: And toxins will get
broken down by this stuff.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Teruo Higa is proving--
and I've got this

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
on a hidden web
page on my website.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
We'll give out
the link to that--

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.029 align:middle line:84%
but there's a Japanese
professor named

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Teruo Higa who came up
with these microbes.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, he is neutralizing
radioactivity

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:84%
in Japan on the
farms and in soils

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and on plants with
these microbes.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's dirt cheap.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
You can culture
your own and make

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
gallons and gallons
and gallons of it.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what you do
is take the microbes,

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:84%
mix it thousands
of parts of water

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:90%
to one part of these microbes.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Spray them on the crops.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Spray them on the soil.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
They will eat the
radioactive elements

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and break them down
into nontoxic elements.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's fabulous.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: And he's not
the only one doing it.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
University of
Birmingham in the UK,

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
there's a professor there
named Lynne Macaskie who

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.160 align:middle line:84%
is using E.coli
bacteria to break down

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:84%
radioactive elements
into nontoxic elements.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:84%
And she's proving it, and
there are other people.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's amazing what
microbes can do and bacteria

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
can do to transform
things that are negative.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.744 align:middle line:90%
We think of them as our enemies.

00:17:21.744 --> 00:17:23.243 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: They're
nature's nanotech.

00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: They're
highly beneficial.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And these ORMUS
elements, these angstrom,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
which are just a few atoms of
these minerals bonded together,

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and the monoatomics, which
are individual atoms-- those

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:90%
are nature's nanotechnology.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are the nanotech that
are healing and helpful.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:90%
They enhance consciousness.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:84%
They strengthen the
mind-body connection.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
They accelerate
healing because they

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
strengthen the
mind-body connection.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
interesting point, too,

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and this is the role of
consciousness in healing.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a man named
Thomas Bearden

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.350 align:middle line:84%
who was a NASA
nuclear physicist.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.716 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant skalar physicist.

00:17:56.716 --> 00:17:57.757 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Brilliant man.

00:17:57.757 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: And I was looking at
one of his patent applications

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
for a method for
neutralizing radioactivity,

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and he said in that patent
application that he got

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
the idea from observing
how human cells regenerate.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And what he figured out was
that human cells will actually

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:84%
send skalar waves through these
monoatomic elements in the cell

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:84%
structures out into other
dimensions of time and space

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
or other frequencies of time
and space, go into the past

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and get the genetic pattern
for the healthy cell,

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle line:84%
bring it back into the
present, and utilize

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.094 align:middle line:90%
it to make the new healthy cell.

00:18:32.094 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
that makes sense.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of certain
healing methods

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:84%
as well where all one
has to do is use the mind

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:84%
to collapse the
time-space continuum back

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
into that perfect
reality, and you

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
can have instant
healings with people.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.539 align:middle line:90%
And this is, again, the same.

00:18:46.539 --> 00:18:48.788 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: That's the way all
healing actually happens.

00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
The mind is restructuring
the matter in the body moment

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:90%
by moment.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we take in
food or supplements

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
or whatever to heal
and regenerate cells,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
that's really just because
of our belief systems.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
We're getting these raw
materials, yes, to help out,

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and it does accelerate it.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But I have worked with people
who just work on the mind

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and will heal major
ailments like brain cancer

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:84%
or restructure bones in the
body from severe trauma.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So the mind absolutely
has the ability

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.460 align:middle line:84%
to restructure matter in
the body and elsewhere.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
We have just not
developed those abilities.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
we've got to get back to,

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:84%
is purifying our mind,
purifying our emotions,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
purifying our bodies,
getting these toxins out,

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:84%
whether they're physical
toxins or emotional toxins.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I've done work, for example,
with meditation-- vipassana

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:84%
meditation in particular--
where you sit and do

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
12 hours of meditation a
day for 10 days straight.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:84%
You take a vow of
silence, and all

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:84%
you do is go within and
observe your breath.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But in that process, I have
disconnected my consciousness

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
from my physical body and
seen the subatomic energetic

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
structure of the
body and seen what

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
they call Gordian knots,
these energetic knots that

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
block the physical
structures in the body.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can use the
mind to release those.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that
you do, whatever

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
physical issues you had related
to them go away instantly.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So absolutely we can
heal very quickly just

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.195 align:middle line:90%
using the mind and emotions.

00:20:13.195 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about this.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: OK.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.835 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
what this device is

00:20:16.835 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
is basically it
has inside the box

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:84%
a very small circuit that
generates skalar waves,

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and it sends those skalar
wave signals into a coil

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that I developed that
mimics human DNA.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when I learned that
human DNA was basically

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
a superconducting antenna
for consciousness,

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
it takes consciousness
and brings it

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
into a form in the
genetic expression.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So the genetic blueprint is
not in the DNA chemistry.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
It's in consciousness.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's in
consciousness, yes.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.174 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: And it's just
transferred through the DNA

00:20:47.174 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:90%
into physicality.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the coil in
it mimics the human DNA.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And that coil is wrapped
around a selenite crystal,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and then it's all
immersed in a resin that

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
is full of 12 different
ORMUS-bearing minerals

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and metal powders
of various kinds.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it's orgonite
amped up in its power.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So it puts out a strong skalar
field that pulses at what's

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:90%
called the Schumann resonance.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:84%
The Schumann
resonance is a pulsing

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.779 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth's atmosphere
that is supposed

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:84%
to slow us down and relax our
brains and nervous systems.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Our brains and
nervous systems are

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:84%
designed to entrain
with pulsing.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.192 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you hear
a beat or you hear music,

00:21:33.192 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:90%
you want to go with the beat.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
It's because we're designed
to entrain with that.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And so the Earth
has its own pulse

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that is designed like
a mother's heartbeat

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:84%
to calm us down, relax us,
and slow us down and get us

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
into deep sleep, particularly
delta and theta brain wave

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:90%
states at night.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Nobody hardly is getting
into those brain wave states

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.240 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Because of all the
man-made EMF on the planet,

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:84%
the Schumann
resonance of the Earth

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.450 align:middle line:84%
has accelerated to almost
double of what it should be.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So instead of listening
to Lawrence Welk,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
we're all listening to
disco, and our brains

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and our nervous systems don't
shut down completely at night.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So this pulses at the
old Schumann resonance,

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:15.079 align:middle line:84%
the original 7.86 Hertz, and
slows you down and gets you

00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:16.120 align:middle line:90%
into deep sleep at night.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.203 align:middle line:84%
And when you're awake, it
doesn't make you sleepy.

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:90%
It destresses you.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It stops jet lag and a whole
host of different benefits.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But having developed
this technology,

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I was familiar with
building with skalar waves.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And skalar waves really are
kind of the energetic fabric

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.770 align:middle line:84%
What they are are
faster-than-light energy

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
that flows in these spirals
that branch as they go along.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And this branching
is called fractaling,

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
so they're spiraling
vortexes of energy

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
that branch and
fractal as they go.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And I liken it to
God consciousness,

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's been
discovered-- and I

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:84%
know you have had Nassim
Haramein and a bunch

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.625 align:middle line:84%
of other people on your
programs discussing this,

00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
but the structure
of the universe

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and how energy flows
through the universe.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
This faster-than-light
skalar energy

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
centers of universes,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:84%
flows outward,
spiraling and branching

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
as it goes through the
centers of galaxies.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And galaxies have this
energetic structure

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.869 align:middle line:90%
like a torus or a doughnut.

00:23:17.869 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the energy
comes spiraling out

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:24.439 align:middle line:84%
of center of that donut outward
around the outside of the donut

00:23:24.439 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and back into the center,
and it just continually

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:90%
is spiraling around like that.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at our galaxy,
that's how it's structured.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:84%
The planets and the suns
are all pinwheeling out

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the galaxy.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Well this energy, as it's coming
from the center of the galaxy,

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
it's relayed outward from the
centers of suns to other suns

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:42.910 align:middle line:90%
to other suns.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Nassim Haramein is
talking about this,

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
how the center of
suns and planets

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:84%
have singularities
inside of them

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
or this black hole-white
hole combination.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is simply
another higher dimensional

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
aspect of themselves and
information flowing through

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.829 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Exactly.

00:23:58.829 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And so just like at the
scale of the galactic

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you've got this torus-shaped
field of energy flowing

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:84%
in spirals of the whole galaxy,
individual suns and planets

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
also have that same field,
that same toral field

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:90%
with the same flow of energy.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And so as that energy's flowing
and being relayed from sun

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.530 align:middle line:84%
to sun to sun and from sun
to the planet, it gets to us,

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:22.897 align:middle line:84%
and it comes to us from
our sun from above and from

00:24:22.897 --> 00:24:24.355 align:middle line:84%
inside the Earth
from a singularity

00:24:24.355 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the Earth.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And it comes to
us, and guess what?

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
We're full of
singularities, too.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
We have the same
torus-shaped field around us.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So do our cells.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:90%
So does each atom.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Exactly.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Our cells, the atoms.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Everything is that.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Exactly.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It goes infinitely.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So what we're really
living in is a universe

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that is a web of black holes--
actually black hole-white hole

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:90%
combinations or singularities.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand
that, you get this flow

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
of faster-than-light skalar
waves going through all of it.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when it gets to us,
we can use our consciousness

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
to slow it down and
coagulate it into the matter

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.434 align:middle line:84%
and the energies that
we can see and measure.

00:25:01.434 --> 00:25:02.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
That's how consciousness
creates reality.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not some metaphysical
woo-woo concept.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are skalar
wave transceivers.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:84%
They pick up and
transmit skalar waves,

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and they create
reality that way.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
These skalar waves slow down
and become matter or the energy

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that we can measure,
and we're constantly

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:90%
doing this continually.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So these devices are just
constructs outside of ourselves

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.870 align:middle line:90%
that we don't really need.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.654 align:middle line:84%
We can do all this
stuff ourselves.

00:25:28.654 --> 00:25:30.195 align:middle line:84%
It's just that with
all the craziness

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that's going on in the
world-- for example,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.660 align:middle line:84%
you could get a group
of people and go

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
sit in a circle out
in your backyard,

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and you can clear chem trails
simply by meditating on it,

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.722 align:middle line:84%
using your skalar wave
generators to do that.

00:25:43.722 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But you'd have to be out
there all day and all night.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.195 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you'd have
to have very clear focus.

00:25:48.195 --> 00:25:50.320 align:middle line:84%
This is often the problem
when people come together

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:90%
in meditation.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The desire is to go away feeling
enhanced or better oneself.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And so the mind wanders
off to this and that,

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:02.735 align:middle line:84%
and you have very non-cohesive
types of meditations in group

00:26:02.735 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
instead of -- what you're
talking about would require

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:84%
laser-like focus of each of the
participants for an extended

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.705 align:middle line:84%
period of time, which
we're not very good at yet.

00:26:10.705 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Exactly, exactly.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this has that
laser-like focus is what

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.413 align:middle line:90%
you're saying.

00:26:14.413 --> 00:26:15.284 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Exactly.

00:26:15.284 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
That's it, and that's
a very good point.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why shamans
and mystics and teachers

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.470 align:middle line:84%
throughout time have talked
about purifying the mind,

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
purifying the body, purifying
the emotions so that you

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.370 align:middle line:84%
can develop that
focus and manifest

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:84%
the life of your dreams
rather than being subjected

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:90%
to the reality of other people.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.364 align:middle line:84%
So these are a crutch
for our current paradigm.

00:26:38.364 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But they're
a crutch that's useful?

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Very useful.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it protects against EMF.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.727 align:middle line:90%
It gets you into deep sleep.

00:26:44.727 --> 00:26:46.726 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about the chem trail part.

00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:90%
We have some chem trail images.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
that ruffled effect

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:84%
of these layers upon
layers upon layers,

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.827 align:middle line:90%
this one we're looking at here.

00:26:55.827 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:90%
That is not natural.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:84%
How can anyone look
up and say there's

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:90%
something natural about that?

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:84%
It just cracks me
up that it's so

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.737 align:middle line:90%
obvious there's a problem here.

00:27:04.737 --> 00:27:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, if you
study fluid dynamics,

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:84%
there are occasions when these
kinds of patterns can show up

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.137 align:middle line:84%
in clouds, but not
for 150 miles across.

00:27:12.137 --> 00:27:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not across.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: I mean, I've flown
in airplanes across the entire

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:84%
state of Georgia and seen the
whole sky across all of Georgia

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.807 align:middle line:84%
covered with these
patterns, these --

00:27:23.807 --> 00:27:25.890 align:middle line:84%
longitudinal wave patterns
is what they're called.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
have zippered effects.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.379 align:middle line:90%
Well, here we go.

00:27:29.379 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting here.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.564 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Those are two
skalar wave patterns that are

00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:84%
intersecting, as you
can see from above.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.658 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:27:36.658 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday when I was flying in,
I flew right over a chem trail

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:90%
just freshly made.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And it had that grayish
quality from above as

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
opposed to the white
of the cumulus and all.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Yeah.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't dissolve
like water vapors do.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it
doesn't dissolve.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So tell us again the
significance of this.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, these skalar
waves that I've been talking

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.913 align:middle line:90%
about, they always travel.

00:27:54.913 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They spiral in a
vortex, and they're

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.239 align:middle line:84%
what are called
longitudinal waves.

00:27:59.239 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Normal waves that
we're familiar with

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
are called transverse waves,
and they move up and down

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.269 align:middle line:84%
And in reality,
actually, they spiral.

00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:07.685 align:middle line:84%
I was taught in
engineering school

00:28:07.685 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that electricity flows
in waves like this.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.375 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it doesn't.

00:28:10.375 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It spirals.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: It's spiraling.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.350 align:middle line:84%
You're just looking
at it from the side,

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.058 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like it's
going up and down.

00:28:15.058 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:90%
But these are more like waves.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
If you take a Slinky and
you shake it back and forth

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and it jiggles back and forth,
that's a transverse wave.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.351 align:middle line:84%
If you take it and just drop
it straight down, hanging down,

00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:84%
it will get a pressure wave in
it, and that's a skalar wave.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:90%
That's a longitudinal wave.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So these are signatures of
longitudinal waves, which

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.030 align:middle line:84%
are created by these
man-made skalar wave

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:84%
generators like HAARP
towers or GWEN towers.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the HAARP is
interfacing with the chem

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:90%
trails?

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.457 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Right.

00:28:40.457 --> 00:28:42.790 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of it is
from what little information--

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's
a HAARP array.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: There's a HAARP array.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.915 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that that
classic one in Alaska?

00:28:45.915 --> 00:28:47.581 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: That's the
one in Alaska, mhm.

00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that when
you spray these metal powders

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.926 align:middle line:84%
over an area, they act as
an antenna for skalar waves.

00:28:53.926 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you bombard an
area with skalar waves

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
or other kinds of
frequencies, they

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:05.440 align:middle line:84%
spread the frequency evenly
below the metal aerosols.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm sure there
are other uses for them,

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you in
making skalar devices using

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:84%
these metal powders that it
evens out the wave patterns.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can bombard
an area more evenly

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
with a frequency which can be
used for healing or suppressing

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.375 align:middle line:84%
consciousness or
all kinds of stuff.

00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's another
one on your site that's really

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:28.350 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a satellite view in real
time of chem trails being laid

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
across the United States,
which is, when you look at it,

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:90%
is just shocking.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really going to
go into the emotions of it,

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:90%
depressing.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.524 align:middle line:84%
Because here, on
many, many levels--

00:29:44.524 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:84%
to say nothing of the fact
that we're being poisoned

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:84%
with this-- but secondarily,
you think about it,

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and here we have this horrible
economic crisis going on.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But somehow in the
black budget, there's

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:84%
enough money to do all these
amazingly expensive projects

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
that don't seem to work
toward our benefit.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So just on cost
analysis alone, this

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.794 align:middle line:84%
is devastating that our
money is being used that way.

00:30:08.794 --> 00:30:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, I don't know
that our money is being used.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.920 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the work of
David Wilcock and other people

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.489 align:middle line:90%
exposing this secret economy--

00:30:17.489 --> 00:30:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I understand
what you're saying,

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:90%
but it's still our money.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well,
ultimately it is, sure.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We supply
it through drugs.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:90%
There are many different ways.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly the
narcotics industry

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
is one of the big ways of
feeding that particular Black

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Ops beast, black budget.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And nonetheless, we're not
paying for it with tax dollars,

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.320 align:middle line:90%
but we're paying for it.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Right, in many ways.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Energetically as well.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:39.674 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:39.674 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.510 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I look at
what's going on with science

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.894 align:middle line:84%
and the military, it's
completely insane to me.

00:30:47.894 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe anybody would be
so stupid to think that the way

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.268 align:middle line:84%
to clean up pollutants
is by putting more

00:30:52.268 --> 00:30:56.110 align:middle line:84%
pollutants in the air, which is
their cover story, of course.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So none of it makes
sense to me, because they

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.640 align:middle line:90%
live on this planet as well.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But what's going
on in my impression

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.990 align:middle line:84%
of working with people
like this or meeting people

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.600 align:middle line:84%
like this is that
most of them are

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.020 align:middle line:84%
so disconnected from themselves
and from other people

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and from nature that
they are not aware

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and don't believe that
it's causing problems

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.490 align:middle line:84%
They are completely
objectified in it.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we were
talking about when

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:84%
you say this device has
the capability of clearing

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:84%
the effects of chem
trails, explain

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.830 align:middle line:90%
what that means technically.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, this particular
device doesn't, but this

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.980 align:middle line:90%
technology does.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
some for examples.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.025 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, this technology.

00:31:38.025 --> 00:31:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: OK, I have
worked with people.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't worked
with this man,

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:84%
but there is a Russian physicist
named Alexander Golod, who

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:84%
is a highly
credentialed physicist.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:84%
He works for the
Russian government.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:50.840 align:middle line:84%
He has a multimillion
dollar budget.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Russian
military, I'm sure,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:84%
was interested in studying
pyramids for weaponry.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.140 align:middle line:84%
But Golod, to his
credit, studied them

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.370 align:middle line:84%
intently for beneficial
purposes, including healing.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.325 align:middle line:84%
And he built a
very large pyramid.

00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:84%
He built lots of them
around the world,

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and he discovered
one thing-- that all

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.710 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids
around the world are

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:84%
part of one planetary
skalar wave grid system.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So even though they may have
been built at different times

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.910 align:middle line:84%
by different cultures,
there was somebody

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that had to have had a global
perspective or possibly

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
perspective that coordinated

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.890 align:middle line:84%
the building of these
pyramids into one skalar wave

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.480 align:middle line:90%
system around the globe.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So he showed that,
and he's talked a lot

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
about that, which is quite
interesting in and of itself

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:39.449 align:middle line:84%
that a high-level Russian
physicist would say this.

00:32:39.449 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And my understanding
is Putin and many other

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.880 align:middle line:84%
high-level physicists and
dignitaries around the world

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.472 align:middle line:84%
actually utilize one of those
pyramids for healing effects.

00:32:47.472 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: I wouldn't
be at all surprised,

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.830 align:middle line:84%
because these secrets have been
known by the powers that be

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:84%
throughout time, and they
have been utilized by them.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They just don't share them
with the average Joe Sixpack.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.376 align:middle line:90%
That's what it boils down to.

00:33:00.376 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you've just
opened up a whole other area

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.210 align:middle line:84%
of discussion we'll get into in
a moment because of this notion

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that these were intelligently
laid out to begin with

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and continued over millennia
after millennia to be laid out.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But before we get into that
and the potential consciousness

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.116 align:middle line:84%
behind that, let's look at
the pyramid as a mountain--

00:33:21.116 --> 00:33:23.115 align:middle line:84%
I mean, essentially, as
an artificial construct.

00:33:23.115 --> 00:33:26.867 align:middle line:84%
You say that mountains are
skalar wave transceivers.

00:33:26.867 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Yes.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so let's
look at the mountains.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.400 align:middle line:84%
We're in the Rocky
Mountains right now.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:30.941 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: OK.

00:33:30.941 --> 00:33:34.879 align:middle line:84%
This is a great example of
how this fits into this model

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:36.920 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking about
with this energy flowing

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.446 align:middle line:84%
for the centers of galaxies and
it's relayed from sun to sun

00:33:39.446 --> 00:33:39.946 align:middle line:90%
to sun.

00:33:39.946 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It comes to us.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It gets to us, and it's coming
up from the center of the Earth

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming
down from the sun.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.740 align:middle line:84%
When it's coming up from
the center of the Earth,

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.522 align:middle line:84%
it's passing through
the body of the Earth

00:33:50.522 --> 00:33:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and through the
crust of the Earth.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets
closer to the surface,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:84%
it's passing through
minerals and crystals

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:90%
that will modify its frequency.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Crystals are oscillators.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.841 align:middle line:90%
They modulate frequencies.

00:34:00.841 --> 00:34:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is well known
in physics and engineering.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're used for.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the crystals and
the minerals around the planet

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:84%
are chakras of the
Earth that modulate

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.460 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies of
this skalar energy

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
into beneficial and healing
natural frequencies that

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.290 align:middle line:84%
benefit living organisms
on the surface.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:23.874 align:middle line:84%
And mountains are simply
large skalar wave transmitters

00:34:23.874 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and receivers where
that energy is

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.690 align:middle line:84%
coming in from the center
of the Earth to them

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and also coming
down from the sun.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.989 align:middle line:90%
It meets inside of them.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And particularly with
volcanic mountains

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:84%
that are high in these
monoatomic minerals,

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
these superconducting
minerals, volcanic rock

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.850 align:middle line:90%
is particularly high in them.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And so they act as a lens or an
antenna for these skalar waves,

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:51.082 align:middle line:84%
and they bring them into form
and have effects in their area

00:34:51.082 --> 00:34:53.040 align:middle line:84%
that are very beneficial
for a living organism.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So mountains all around the
world are skalar wave antennas

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:90%
or transceivers.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out you can make
man-made artificial skalar wave

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:84%
transceivers by
mimicking mountains.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.915 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ie, pyramids.

00:35:04.915 --> 00:35:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Yeah.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.457 align:middle line:84%
Orgonite, Wilhelm Reich's
work, these pyramids--

00:35:08.457 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:90%
that's what they do.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.270 align:middle line:84%
If you build them out
of certain materials,

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.292 align:middle line:84%
particularly high ORMUS
stone-- the pyramids in Egypt,

00:35:15.292 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:84%
for example, are made out
of sedimentary stone that's

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
high in these
monoatomic minerals--

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and you build them with
certain dimensions and angles.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger they are,
the bigger the waves

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:90%
they can capture.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Then you can tune
them to pick up

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:84%
certain frequencies
for different purposes,

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and those purposes
can be for healing

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:84%
or for balancing weather,
neutralizing toxins.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Because Golod showed in
his scientific research

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:84%
with his pyramids, particularly
the one outside of Moscow--

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.010 align:middle line:84%
it's like an
141-foot-high pyramid--

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.980 align:middle line:84%
that it will neutralize
radioactivity.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It will neutralize toxins
in soil and air and water.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.396 align:middle line:84%
People that sit inside
of it, it will heal them

00:35:56.396 --> 00:35:58.700 align:middle line:90%
of major ailments.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:03.280 align:middle line:84%
It even brought back an
extinct species of flower,

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.370 align:middle line:90%
and this is mind-blowing.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about that.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:90%
That is mind-blowing.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: This was what really
gave me hope for the world when

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.710 align:middle line:90%
I saw this.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Because, like I say,
I know that there

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:84%
are solutions for
all these problems,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think that all of
these solutions are out there,

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:20.174 align:middle line:84%
and we're just going to
go up in a puff of smoke.

00:36:20.174 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that things
are going to change,

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and things are
going to get better

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:90%
for the people that choose it.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.457 align:middle line:84%
But Golod noticed that they've
got these large fields--

00:36:28.457 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and you can go on
YouTube, by the way,

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and you can see his
pyramid on YouTube.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Just search on his name.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It's Alexander G-O-L-O-D. And
outside the fields around this

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.886 align:middle line:84%
pyramid, large fields, they
noticed these flowers growing

00:36:42.886 --> 00:36:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that no one had
ever seen before.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.361 align:middle line:84%
So they called in a
botanist and discovered

00:36:46.361 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that the flowers had
been extinct on Earth

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.010 align:middle line:90%
for 11 million years.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard that,
it was mind-blowing.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And he theorized that
what was going on

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.360 align:middle line:84%
is that these
pyramids were bringing

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.470 align:middle line:84%
in the pattern
for these flowers.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Somehow they tuned into it.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.510 align:middle line:84%
What some people might
call the akashic records,

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:90%
he calls the quantum field.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But he theorized that the
pattern for everything

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that has ever
existed or ever will

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:84%
is out there in
the quantum field

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and that we can bring them in
with these skalar wave devices.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, human beings are
skalar wave transceivers, too.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Our brains and nervous
systems do the same thing.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So that told me that
we can potentially

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.950 align:middle line:84%
bring back extinct species
that we've killed off.

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So even if it looks hopeless,
even if we kill the oceans off

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and all of this stuff,
there's the potential

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.124 align:middle line:84%
that we could bring
these species back.

00:37:35.124 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Which is amazing.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: It's very exciting.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk a little bit about

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.846 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness behind it.

00:37:39.846 --> 00:37:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the controversial
part of our conversation.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But I've dealt with so
many people over the years

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and had experiences
myself that it's

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:90%
not even uncomfortable anymore.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.560 align:middle line:90%
So let's just go for it.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Throughout your
life, you have also

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.860 align:middle line:84%
had contact with beings--
off-planet cultures is

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.100 align:middle line:84%
the politically-correct term
now-- in other words, aliens.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And we can argue back and
forth in our communities

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
about whether this
is something that's

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.880 align:middle line:84%
projected from somewhere,
whether it's other dimensional,

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.600 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, the
proof is in the pudding,

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and the information
that has flowed through

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:20.280 align:middle line:84%
to you and others has been
extremely profound in helping

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.240 align:middle line:84%
you understand some of
these higher concepts.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about what was shared with you

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.675 align:middle line:84%
and how they
initially came to you?

00:38:28.675 --> 00:38:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Yeah.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've been coming
to me my whole life,

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
but it evolved over the
course of my lifetime

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.087 align:middle line:84%
as I grew and developed
and could understand more

00:38:40.087 --> 00:38:41.670 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of
what was going on.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.014 align:middle line:84%
As a child, I had a lot
of unusual experiences.

00:38:45.014 --> 00:38:47.180 align:middle line:84%
For example, I would wake
up in the middle of night,

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and there would be a
bright light coming

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in from the windows
in my bedroom.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And I would see humanoid
silhouettes in my bedroom,

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and I would just have
a brief memory of that,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and that would be it.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally, I would
have very, very vivid,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.289 align:middle line:84%
colorful dreams where
I would get information

00:39:04.289 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't even remember
what the information was.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I would just remember getting
downloads of information.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And as I got older, they
started becoming more conscious

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.330 align:middle line:84%
where I would have these not
really even dreams, but altered

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:84%
states, usually at night,
where I would get information.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't have any
bearing on anything in my life

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.320 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I got into
my 20s and I started

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:36.770 align:middle line:84%
getting exposed to the Seth
material and channel material,

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I started to wonder
if some of these

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.095 align:middle line:84%
experiences I had if
it wasn't just me.

00:39:44.095 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, oh,
these are just weird dreams

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.310 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, and it's just me.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
to think, well, I

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.504 align:middle line:84%
wonder if this is coming
from somewhere else.

00:39:50.504 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And so over a period of
many years, particularly

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.185 align:middle line:84%
throughout my 20s, I
started talking to myself,

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.560 align:middle line:84%
to these voices
that were sharing

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:84%
this information, these
pictures and things,

00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.885 align:middle line:90%
and saying, well, OK.

00:39:59.885 --> 00:40:03.950 align:middle line:84%
If this isn't me, then I
want to know who you are.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I went
through this period

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of many years of
experiences that brought me

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
to the understanding that
I was indeed having contact

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.829 align:middle line:84%
with inter-dimensional
beings, extraterrestrials,

00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:18.120 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call them.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.210 align:middle line:84%
They presented themselves
to me as reptilians.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I did
encounter them visually.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't touch them.

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.612 align:middle line:84%
But I kept saying to
them, if you're for real

00:40:29.612 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and this isn't all
just in my head,

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.852 align:middle line:84%
then I've got to
meet you physically.

00:40:32.852 --> 00:40:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell
me, we can't do that,

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.570 align:middle line:84%
because your DNA has been
programmed to fear us.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:39.030 align:middle line:84%
It would traumatize
you and thwart the work

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.265 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing with you.

00:40:40.265 --> 00:40:42.473 align:middle line:84%
But I kept pressing for it
and kept pressing for it.

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And so finally, I
did see them out

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.500 align:middle line:84%
in some woods at a very
powerful vortex place.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And they were right.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:51.900 align:middle line:90%
It terrified me.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And for a few years,
I was terrified

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of being abducted
and stuff like that.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, this is
an important thing to bring up.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the R word,
"reptilian," we

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.697 align:middle line:84%
are designed to be
frightened of it.

00:41:02.697 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, with a lot
of the work of my friend David

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Icke and others,
which have highlighted

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.710 align:middle line:84%
some of what the rogue
elements have done,

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:13.270 align:middle line:84%
we have reason to probably-- if
you're going to go into fear--

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.760 align:middle line:84%
you might as well fear that
as much as anything else

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and collaborations with
people in the power structures

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that we know of and you
alluded to a little bit ago.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same as
with human beings.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And this species,
just as there are

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:84%
those who have gone rogue and
choose to exploit humanity,

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.270 align:middle line:84%
there are those who
are certainly here

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
along with many other species
trying to help humanity.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
that's the nature

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.409 align:middle line:90%
of your relationship with them.

00:41:43.409 --> 00:41:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Exactly, and
that's been my experience.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've met quite a few
scientists and inventors

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:84%
who also have had
extraterrestrial contact quite

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.059 align:middle line:90%
extensively.

00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And most of them
won't talk about it,

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.767 align:middle line:84%
because it would destroy
their academic credentials.

00:41:55.767 --> 00:41:57.849 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I don't have
any academic credentials

00:41:57.849 --> 00:41:58.400 align:middle line:90%
to destroy.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.108 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care what
people think of me,

00:42:00.108 --> 00:42:03.440 align:middle line:84%
so I'll tell the truth about my
experience, delusional or not.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't really care
what people think.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.275 align:middle line:84%
But this is a little
secret that people in the

00:42:10.275 --> 00:42:11.900 align:middle line:84%
know who are developing
these-- I would

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.274 align:middle line:84%
be at all surprised,
for example,

00:42:13.274 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:84%
if Alexander Golod
is having some kind

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.439 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial interaction.

00:42:16.439 --> 00:42:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, well, I can't
tell you how many people I

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.660 align:middle line:90%
interview have.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Most of them admit it.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Some don't want to talk
about it on camera.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Even Colin Andrews has just
come out with his book finally

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.976 align:middle line:84%
revealing how he was exposed
to all this information

00:42:32.976 --> 00:42:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge
about crop circles.

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It took him a long
time, but he's saying,

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.360 align:middle line:84%
no, this is how
it actually works.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:84%
These beings are
reaching out to us.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.026 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, for anybody
that thinks it's a bunch

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:44.750 align:middle line:84%
of nonsense, just go on to
YouTube and search on Paul

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Hellyer.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I think it's H-E-L-Y-E-R.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I think I'm
going to be speaking with him

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.274 align:middle line:90%
on my show soon.

00:42:49.274 --> 00:42:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Great.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Paul Hellyer, the
former minister

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.711 align:middle line:84%
of defense of
Canada, the man who

00:42:54.711 --> 00:42:56.585 align:middle line:84%
was in charge of the
whole military in Canada

00:42:56.585 --> 00:42:58.376 align:middle line:84%
who reports directly
to the prime minister,

00:42:58.376 --> 00:43:03.400 align:middle line:84%
is on camera before US
Congresspeople saying not only

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.900 align:middle line:84%
have all these
different governments

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.090 align:middle line:84%
had extraterrestrial contact,
but the United States

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.110 align:middle line:84%
has two ETs working
for them right now.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:90%
OK so we have that straight.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.330 align:middle line:90%
This is a reality.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about--
because you're

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:19.000 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
healing implications

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.126 align:middle line:84%
for these technologies with
what we're being exposed to.

00:43:22.126 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as you say, the
solution arrives just

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.470 align:middle line:90%
in time with the problem.

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And what was explained
to you regarding

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.375 align:middle line:84%
this kind of technology,
radiation, all of it?

00:43:30.375 --> 00:43:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well,
in the beginning,

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I got lots and lots of
information that didn't make

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.310 align:middle line:84%
any sense to me about
gold, for example.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.560 align:middle line:84%
These reptiles spent a year and
half talking to me about gold.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.309 align:middle line:84%
They went on and on
and on about gold.

00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't make any sense
to me, because of the time

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.850 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't aware of monoatomics.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:47.474 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
really talking about

00:43:47.474 --> 00:43:48.340 align:middle line:90%
was monoatomic gold.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But they said things like
that extraterrestrials

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.970 align:middle line:84%
used monoatomic gold for
time travel and dimension

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.080 align:middle line:84%
travel because it
existed the same

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.120 align:middle line:84%
throughout different
dimensions of time and space.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And so guess what?

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.250 align:middle line:84%
There are, of course,
military and I

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:07.264 align:middle line:84%
think it was Argonne National
Labs developed a spacecraft,

00:44:07.264 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
supposedly, that can
time travel and dimension

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.440 align:middle line:90%
travel using monoatomic gold.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, David Hudson
has shown that it will.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.550 align:middle line:84%
So they gave me
information about that.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.784 align:middle line:84%
It was always these
snippets of information.

00:44:18.784 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
They had it very
well planned out.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it didn't
make any sense.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because this is
not information that you were

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:23.860 align:middle line:90%
familiar with at the time.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: No, not at all.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they prepped you
over a long period of time.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.191 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Oh, many years.

00:44:28.191 --> 00:44:30.054 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so you
came to the point --

00:44:30.054 --> 00:44:32.670 align:middle line:84%
once you were given
the bits of data,

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.780 align:middle line:84%
what was your clear and present
understanding about how all

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.560 align:middle line:84%
of this can be reversed and
utilized for healthy purposes

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.710 align:middle line:90%
instead of negative?

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.793 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, the most
important point, I think,

00:44:42.793 --> 00:44:45.840 align:middle line:84%
of it all is that the way to fix
everything is to reconnect with

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.840 align:middle line:84%
nature and reconnect
with ourselves.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, yes, you can
make monoatomic elements

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.160 align:middle line:84%
in all these alchemical
ways, but it's

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.520 align:middle line:84%
going to create all
kinds of problems,

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.370 align:middle line:84%
just like all these other
man-made things we've done

00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:59.180 align:middle line:90%
are going to create problems.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.570 align:middle line:90%
You've got to use nature.

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So instead of using lye
and all these toxic methods

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.400 align:middle line:84%
of making monoatomic elements
that are toxic themselves,

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.880 align:middle line:84%
use fermentation
or photosynthesis

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:90%
or vortexing water.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.005 align:middle line:84%
That's another
great way to do it.

00:45:13.005 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, water vortex.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.135 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: These are all natural
ways that have been tried

00:45:16.135 --> 00:45:17.621 align:middle line:90%
and true for thousands of years.

00:45:17.621 --> 00:45:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Teachers throughout time have
been talking about this stuff.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.250 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But with this new understanding
of the nature of it,

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.410 align:middle line:84%
we can make it
even more powerful

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.100 align:middle line:90%
and enhance it even stronger.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we only
have a couple minutes here.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about also

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:84%
some of the foods
and other elements

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that you really rely on
to keep the body clean

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.035 align:middle line:84%
and also to transmute these
heavy metals, for one.

00:45:40.035 --> 00:45:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Yeah.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.066 align:middle line:90%
That's a very important point.

00:45:42.066 --> 00:45:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Because for most people,
with their belief systems,

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.148 align:middle line:84%
you're going to need to
do the physical things,

00:45:46.148 --> 00:45:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and that means, for example,
continual detoxification

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:51.780 align:middle line:90%
of the body using food.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I use, for example, lots and
lots of chlorophyll in my diet.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I eat probably at least
80% raw living foods.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.377 align:middle line:84%
I grow most of my
own food and sprouts.

00:46:02.377 --> 00:46:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I just built a new greenhouse,
as a mater of fact,

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:90%
so I can grow all of my food.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:05.845 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:46:05.845 --> 00:46:06.720 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: And the cool
thing is, for example,

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:14.150 align:middle line:84%
you can grow plants, and you
can use these ferments to make

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.870 align:middle line:90%
plant foods.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:16.766 align:middle line:84%
The same way that you
can feed yourself,

00:46:16.766 --> 00:46:19.140 align:middle line:84%
you can feed them to plants
and it will jack up the ORMUS

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.060 align:middle line:84%
levels in your plants
astronomically.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So then your food is
extremely regenerative

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.237 align:middle line:84%
and will neutralize
radioactivity in the body.

00:46:25.237 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's one thing
right there you can do.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:84%
You can feed rock powders
and microbes to plants

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and create high ORMUS
plants that you can eat,

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and it will neutralize
radiation in body.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Chlorella, any kind
of chlorophyll,

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.282 align:middle line:84%
wheatgrass juice, spirulina--
and also, by the way,

00:46:41.282 --> 00:46:42.740 align:middle line:84%
you can take these
and ferment them

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and make them even
more bioavailable.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Putting
them in with that brew?

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:46.676 align:middle line:84%
Can you put those
in with the brew?

00:46:46.676 --> 00:46:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Yes, absolutely.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.770 align:middle line:84%
For example, Klamath
Lake blue-green algae.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons why
it's so regenerative

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.579 align:middle line:84%
is because the algae are
feeding on volcanic ash

00:46:54.579 --> 00:46:55.995 align:middle line:84%
from the mountains
surrounding it,

00:46:55.995 --> 00:46:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and volcanic minerals are always
high in monoatomic elements.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
ingesting is a big dose

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.126 align:middle line:90%
of ORMUS with those algae.

00:47:03.126 --> 00:47:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
the one I take, yeah.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: So all of those.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:12.980 align:middle line:84%
High-water content living foods
to flush the body continually.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I use zeolites to
pull toxins out.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.990 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
kind of zeolite.

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:18.859 align:middle line:84%
You can also take
zeolites and ferment them

00:47:18.859 --> 00:47:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and have the same effect.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.680 align:middle line:84%
But if there's any toxic
side elements in them,

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.390 align:middle line:84%
which some zeolites have,
you can get rid of them.

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.850 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:29.100 align:middle line:90%
There are medicinal mushrooms.

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:90%
There are fungi.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I stay away nowadays
from eating anything

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.130 align:middle line:84%
from the ocean, particularly
the Pacific Ocean.

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.670 align:middle line:84%
For anybody who thinks that
the Pacific Ocean isn't

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that polluted yet from
Fukushima, think again.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.160 align:middle line:90%
You can go onto YouTube.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And actually if you go to my
website, I'll give you a link,

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:44.560 align:middle line:90%
and you can go and see all this.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's talk
about your website now.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.849 align:middle line:90%
How do people find you?

00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: OK.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, my main website
is freshandalive.com.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:52.130 align:middle line:90%
My blog is beyondrawfood.com.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I talk about
this stuff and I

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:84%
get so many people,
particularly people

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.307 align:middle line:84%
with heavy scientific
conditioning,

00:48:00.307 --> 00:48:02.140 align:middle line:84%
they think that what
I'm saying is nonsense.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So I've accumulated a huge body
of scientific evidence showing

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:07.890 align:middle line:90%
what I'm talking about.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to
 radiationlinks.freshandalive.com,

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:14.669 align:middle line:90%
you can see I've got--

00:48:14.669 --> 00:48:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Those are the
secret files, the proof.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.251 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: And it's
not anywhere else.

00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:20.360 align:middle line:84%
You cannot get to it on
my website from any links.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.318 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go there.

00:48:21.318 --> 00:48:22.520 align:middle line:90%
I will get it on my blog.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.186 align:middle line:84%
But that's got
mountains and mountains

00:48:24.186 --> 00:48:26.560 align:middle line:84%
of evidence about all this
stuff I've been talking about,

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.600 align:middle line:90%
showing this stuff.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And there is a link there to a
video of a man in San Francisco

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.080 align:middle line:84%
measuring radiation
on the beaches,

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.320 align:middle line:90%
and its astronomically high.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous levels.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.084 align:middle line:90%
So it's definitely in the ocean.

00:48:39.084 --> 00:48:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we have a problem,
but we also have the solutions.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:42.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's right to make
the scientific information

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.890 align:middle line:84%
available to people, because
we still have a conscious mind,

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.848 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to
bypass it any time soon.

00:48:51.848 --> 00:48:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So it just has to make sense to
us so that we can take action.

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So any final comment
before we sign off?

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Well, the one thing
that I always leave people with

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:04.640 align:middle line:84%
is to understand that we
truly always have the solution

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously
with the problems.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to do nowadays
is do a few magic hand

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.079 align:middle line:84%
motions like this and this
with the great oracle Google

00:49:13.079 --> 00:49:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and you can find the solutions.

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean just google
"neutralize radioactivity."

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.320 align:middle line:84%
There's 61 patents for
neutralizing radioactivity

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.222 align:middle line:84%
on the first page
of Google results.

00:49:22.222 --> 00:49:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: Why aren't
these people googling?

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, no kidding.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.151 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's such an
important message.

00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I guess because we start
becoming paralyzed.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:33.850 align:middle line:84%
When we're faced with something
that's that large and pervasive

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:36.215 align:middle line:84%
and the fear sets in,
it paralyzes people.

00:49:36.215 --> 00:49:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>> ROHLA: And we're
so mind controlled,

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.173 align:middle line:90%
but that's a whole nother topic.

00:49:39.173 --> 00:49:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
is another topic,

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.549 align:middle line:84%
and you'll come back and we'll
talk about that one as well.

00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for your time, Ken.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:46.381 align:middle line:90%
>> ROHLA: Oh, it's my pleasure.

00:49:46.381 --> 00:49:47.286 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:47.286 --> 00:49:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Again, you can watch
also my interviews with Michael

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:51.118 align:middle line:90%
Murphy and G. Edward Griffin.

00:49:51.118 --> 00:49:53.220 align:middle line:84%
For more background and
to go a little further

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.319 align:middle line:84%
into the whole subject, you can
also watch their documentary

00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:57.860 align:middle line:84%
"Why in the World
are They Spraying?"

00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and "What in the World
are They Spraying?"

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's here,
available on Gaiam TV.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:28.467 align:middle line:90%
