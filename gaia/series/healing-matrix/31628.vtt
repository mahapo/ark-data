00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.871 align:middle line:84%
>> In my last conversation
with Dr. Joe Dispenza,

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.273 align:middle line:84%
affectionately known
to us as Dr. Joe,

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:40.441 align:middle line:90%
we spoke about the mystery

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
of the placebo effect
among other things.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.912 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to dive into
the deeper end of the pool

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:48.115 align:middle line:84%
and speak about our non
physical, non linear self.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.818 align:middle line:84%
The awakening of the
pineal and Kundalini.

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:84%
To understand the brain, we
have to embrace the notion

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.755 align:middle line:90%
that our mind is not our brain

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.791 align:middle line:84%
as mainstream science
would have us believe.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.426 align:middle line:90%
So, welcome back, can't wait.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.095 align:middle line:90%
The last one was on fire.

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:02.229 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.697 align:middle line:84%
When we start getting
into the non physical,

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:07.268 align:middle line:84%
non linear space time past
lives that aren't past lives,

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to
get into and so forth.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.939 align:middle line:90%
I start getting super juiced up.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the terrain I love.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.678 align:middle line:84%
And so, first of all, let's
talk about the human being

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:21.982 align:middle line:90%
in our non linear continence.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:25.219 align:middle line:84%
What that means, what
that is, where it lives.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.389 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to have an
interface with us and so forth.

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So, on the
last show we were talking about,

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.893 align:middle line:84%
you know, we were
watching people's brains.

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.361 align:middle line:84%
Trying to change their
brains what most people do.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.199 align:middle line:84%
We actually try to use
our ego to change our ego.

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:40.935 align:middle line:84%
Try to use the program
to change the program.

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:43.003 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we're
fighting against ourselves.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.873 align:middle line:84%
And if you see a brain
scan of somebody do that,

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:49.143 align:middle line:84%
the brain actually goes
more into hyper coherence,

00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:52.947 align:middle line:84%
more into conscious
beta, high beta thinking.

00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:53.847 align:middle line:90%
In other words

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Monkey brain.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:56.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: They are
actually getting more they're

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.786 align:middle line:84%
analyzing themselves
within their emotions

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:90%
that they've memorized.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.122 align:middle line:84%
And basically they're analyzing
or thinking in the past.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.192 align:middle line:84%
And it drives their brain
further out of balance.

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:08.128 align:middle line:84%
So, when I saw this it was
a classic moment for me

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.164 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
take my eyes off it.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:11.665 align:middle line:90%
I kept thinking about it.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.701 align:middle line:84%
And how we've all
tried to do this.

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.972 align:middle line:84%
And so, in our work, what
we teach people how to do is

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:20.641 align:middle line:84%
and when the brain is doing that
you get very narrow focused.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.809 align:middle line:90%
You get very object focused.

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.379 align:middle line:84%
You obsess about something
a problem, a thing.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.747 align:middle line:90%
You get your loop.

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:31.619 align:middle line:84%
And it causes our awareness
to really to become very very,

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.287 align:middle line:90%
what's called convergent.

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And what the research has
shown, both in our work

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.459 align:middle line:84%
and other work is that when you
teach people how to become aware

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.463 align:middle line:84%
of the space around them in
space, and all of a sudden,

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:44.298 align:middle line:84%
the brain starts to
get more organized.

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:46.901 align:middle line:84%
When the brain moves into
that hyper coherent state,

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.336 align:middle line:84%
different compartments of the
brain that are normally talking

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.338 align:middle line:84%
to each other no
longer communicate.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.507 align:middle line:84%
>> See that's funny, because
when you say hyper coherent,

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.943 align:middle line:84%
most people think of
coherence as a good thing.

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.077 align:middle line:90%
A balancing thing.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:58.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Right.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.047 align:middle line:84%
Right. So, good coherence
means there's a good rhythm.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.216 align:middle line:84%
There's rhythm, there's
synchrony, there's order,

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:04.518 align:middle line:90%
there's a pulse, there's a beat.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.387 align:middle line:84%
Hyper coherence means
it's too fast

00:03:06.387 --> 00:03:07.821 align:middle line:90%
and it's two brains working.

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:10.524 align:middle line:84%
It's hyper incoherent,
we should say.

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:11.859 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So, in that
state of hyper incoherence,

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:16.163 align:middle line:84%
when the stress chemicals
are running when you're

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
under stress, and I'm under
stress, we become very selfish.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.001 align:middle line:90%
That's what those hormones do.

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:90%
We think that we're our bodies.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.239 align:middle line:84%
We think that we're our
identity identifying

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.307 align:middle line:90%
with the environment.

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.042 align:middle line:84%
And we think we're
living in linear time.

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what those hormones do.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.578 align:middle line:84%
If a zebra is being chased
by the lion, she's saying,

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:32.746 align:middle line:90%
"I got to take care of my body.

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.248 align:middle line:90%
I got to put my awareness on it.

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:35.716 align:middle line:84%
Where am I and how
am I going to go

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:36.984 align:middle line:84%
and how much time do
I have to get there."

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:38.352 align:middle line:90%
So, think.

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:39.887 align:middle line:84%
Majority of people that live
their lives, spend their life

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:41.889 align:middle line:90%
in these limited altered states.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.692 align:middle line:84%
Which psychology calls, normal
states of consciousness.

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.226 align:middle line:90%
They're altered states.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.629 align:middle line:84%
So then, just like
you and I we're living

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.099 align:middle line:84%
in that selfish state endorsing
the ego to become selfish,

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.668 align:middle line:84%
self-indulgence,
self-important, self-centered,

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:57.805 align:middle line:84%
self-aggrandizing, you
know - self-absorbed.

00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:59.773 align:middle line:84%
The brain does the
exact same thing.

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.042 align:middle line:84%
The neurons in the brain
that should be communicating

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:04.878 align:middle line:84%
in networks across
the vast landscapes.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden they say,
"There's an emergency,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.249 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to close down and
my neighborhood is not going

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.551 align:middle line:90%
to talk to this neighborhood.

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:13.053 align:middle line:84%
This community is not going
to talk to this community.

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:14.988 align:middle line:84%
This whole state or
region is not going

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to talk to that region."

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.392 align:middle line:84%
The brain starts to become
very subdivided, right?

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:20.661 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
incoherent state.

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:22.529 align:middle line:84%
And it sends a very
incoherent signal

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.131 align:middle line:90%
down the central nervous system,

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.234 align:middle line:84%
which creates a very incoherent
message to the immune systems

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and the digestive systems and
the cardiovascular system.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.207 align:middle line:84%
It's a group of people playing
drums that have no rhythm.

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And the body really begins
to suffer the effects

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.013 align:middle line:84%
because the central
nervous system controls

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:40.748 align:middle line:84%
and coordinates all
the other systems.

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So then, as it sends a
signal to the immune system,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.551 align:middle line:84%
the immune system is
saying, "I don't know how

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to make white blood
cells with that signal.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.489 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to keep the timing

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:50.057 align:middle line:90%
between my digestion working.

00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:51.258 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
keep my own heart

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:52.659 align:middle line:90%
in balance with the brain."

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.028 align:middle line:84%
And so, the body
begins to suffer.

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:58.032 align:middle line:84%
So, when people begin
to put their awareness,

00:04:58.032 --> 00:05:04.204 align:middle line:84%
an open a divergent focus
instead of a convergent focus

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:07.074 align:middle line:90%
that opening of attention.

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:12.179 align:middle line:84%
What people don't realize is
this is who you really are.

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.679 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:13.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:15.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: So, this field

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.451 align:middle line:84%
around your body is
who you really are.

00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:20.287 align:middle line:84%
When you're functioning
by the hormone of stress,

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
you're more particle
and less energy.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.292 align:middle line:84%
You're more matter
and less wave.

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.227 align:middle line:84%
That's the function of
what those hormones do.

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:28.762 align:middle line:90%
We become materialist, right?

00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:30.931 align:middle line:84%
We define reality
with our senses.

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.499 align:middle line:90%
So energy contracts.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.436 align:middle line:84%
So then when you begin to put
your awareness around the space

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:38.305 align:middle line:90%
around your body in space,

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:40.407 align:middle line:84%
that field around your
body is consciousness.

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:42.376 align:middle line:90%
That's who we really are.

00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.945 align:middle line:84%
The moment you put your
awareness on that consciousness,

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:47.681 align:middle line:84%
on that space something
amazing happens.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.017 align:middle line:84%
The brain starts
getting very orderly.

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.752 align:middle line:84%
And you're no longer
using the brain

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:90%
to try to change the brain.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.155 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
using the ego to try

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.124 align:middle line:90%
and change the brain or the ego.

00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:59.426 align:middle line:84%
Or you're not using the program
to try to change the program.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:01.929 align:middle line:84%
You're using consciousness
to change the program

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:03.397 align:middle line:90%
of the brain and the ego.

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:05.866 align:middle line:90%
Because this is you.

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.535 align:middle line:84%
And so, some people would
say, "Well, that's not me.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:09.937 align:middle line:90%
I can't feel that."

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:12.573 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, "Well, you don't
feel your nose unless you put

00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:13.874 align:middle line:90%
your awareness on it.

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.143 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel your little
toe unless you become aware

00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:17.277 align:middle line:90%
of it, right?"

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:19.646 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't put your
awareness on this field,

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:20.881 align:middle line:90%
wherever you put your attention

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.716 align:middle line:84%
or wherever you have you
put your awareness is

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:90%
where energy follows.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.552 align:middle line:90%
Energy follows awareness.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.655 align:middle line:84%
So, the moment you start putting
your awareness and attention

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:32.192 align:middle line:84%
on this sphere around
you, now you're beginning

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:33.994 align:middle line:84%
to introduce yourself
to who you are.

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:37.364 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to get
acquainted with the true self.

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:41.168 align:middle line:84%
And when we study that on the
scans, we saw the brain all

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:44.538 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden having
dominion over the program.

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:46.473 align:middle line:84%
Having ability to
change the brain.

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:47.875 align:middle line:84%
Because consciousness
is the only thing

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:48.909 align:middle line:90%
that can change the brain.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.478 align:middle line:84%
Because you're referring
to the test that were done

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.614 align:middle line:84%
with Jeffrey [inaudible]and the
across the team [inaudible].

00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:55.716 align:middle line:90%
One is doing neuron feedback,

00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:58.519 align:middle line:84%
and the other is measuring the
field at large of the physical

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.387 align:middle line:84%
of the body and of
the surrounding.

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:01.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Sure.

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.623 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing neuron feedback.

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:05.359 align:middle line:84%
We are using quantitative EEG
to really see where people were.

00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:08.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. So, those are
the just for clarification,

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:84%
those are the tests
you were talking about.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.499 align:middle line:84%
So when people start connecting
with their non linear selves

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.101 align:middle line:84%
by intention, what
does that look

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.703 align:middle line:90%
like on the EEG, for example.

00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:18.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well, the
first thing that happens is

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:23.577 align:middle line:84%
that you start seeing the
analytical thinking neocortex

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:25.245 align:middle line:90%
starting to settle down.

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:84%
So now you're no
longer analyzing it.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.551 align:middle line:84%
So the moment you're no longer
analyzing, your brain waves move

00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:90%
from of course beta to alpha.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.557 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're functioning
by the hormones of stress,

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:38.859 align:middle line:84%
you believe that the
outer world is more real

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:39.560 align:middle line:90%
than the inner world.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.894 align:middle line:90%
That's the seduction.

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when the brain
is in high arousal state.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.431 align:middle line:90%
We're functioning

00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:46.333 align:middle line:84%
and determining reality
with our senses.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:49.336 align:middle line:84%
So because we're functioned
by our senses, we're focusing

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:51.905 align:middle line:84%
on the particle of the
atom instead of the wave

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:53.307 align:middle line:90%
and possibility, right?

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:56.543 align:middle line:84%
So then everything
collapses into the known.

00:07:56.543 --> 00:08:00.581 align:middle line:84%
So, when you shift
your awareness

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:01.915 align:middle line:90%
to the space surrounding you

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and the space it means
that you can't think.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.552 align:middle line:84%
And when you sense
this space around you,

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.154 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking,
you're sensing.

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:08.722 align:middle line:90%
And what happens is the thinking

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:11.558 align:middle line:84%
in the neocortex
tends to slow down.

00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:13.393 align:middle line:84%
And the brain waves
tends to get slower.

00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:16.029 align:middle line:84%
You start producing what's
called alpha brain waves.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:18.365 align:middle line:84%
And in alpha, alpha is
the imaginary world.

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:20.867 align:middle line:84%
It's where the inner worlds
starts becoming more real

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.269 align:middle line:90%
than the outer world.

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:26.907 align:middle line:84%
And the way we learn
is we learn information

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:28.008 align:middle line:90%
and then we're in beta.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.576 align:middle line:90%
We're in low levels of beta.

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:31.912 align:middle line:84%
We're in beta right
now, we're relaxed.

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:33.680 align:middle line:84%
If I said to you,
"Hey, listen to me,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.383 align:middle line:84%
you can't eat lunch unless
you take a test that I have.

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:38.885 align:middle line:84%
It's 75 questions and
then we can eat lunch."

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.854 align:middle line:84%
>> That takes you
into high beta.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:41.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza:
Like I got to perk up

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.989 align:middle line:90%
and listen to what he says.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:46.126 align:middle line:84%
But if you're freaked out,
erotic, emotional, insecure,

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:47.861 align:middle line:90%
frustrated, guilty, judgmental,

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.263 align:middle line:84%
you're going into
high range beta.

00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And now, no new information can
enter into the nervous system

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.235 align:middle line:84%
that isn't equaled
to the emotion.

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:57.004 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
brain never has a chance

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:59.973 align:middle line:84%
to consolidate knowledge because
it's not a time to learn.

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:01.008 align:middle line:90%
It's a time to run.

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:02.643 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tiger
around the corner,

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.244 align:middle line:90%
it's time for emergency, right?

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.412 align:middle line:84%
>> We talked about
this last time,

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:06.813 align:middle line:84%
just we touched on
it a little bit.

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:08.915 align:middle line:84%
And that's why most
people can't break

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:11.518 align:middle line:84%
that program [inaudible]
as you say trauma.

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:12.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Right.

00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:14.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Something even louder
that's already there.

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:15.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Right.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.725 align:middle line:84%
So then, when we begin to
teach people how to break

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.862 align:middle line:84%
that addiction and then slow
the body back down again,

00:09:21.862 --> 00:09:25.632 align:middle line:84%
and their brain is moving
from beta down the steps

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:28.769 align:middle line:84%
and in they're going
inward that alpha pattern.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:32.139 align:middle line:84%
And is when you can consolidate
new circuits in your brain.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:33.874 align:middle line:84%
So, like I know when
I'm lecturing

00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:35.275 align:middle line:84%
that people are getting
information

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:38.178 align:middle line:84%
because I'll develop
a concept or an idea.

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:40.514 align:middle line:84%
And as I develop the
concept or idea they'll go

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:44.618 align:middle line:84%
from the outer world
listening me to the inner world

00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of actually consolidating
the knowledge.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.422 align:middle line:84%
They'll pause and their
brain will move into alpha.

00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:51.091 align:middle line:84%
And when it happens, the
brain stores the circuits.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.259 align:middle line:90%
Stores it in circuitry.

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So, when we learn
we move into alpha.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.962 align:middle line:90%
So, if you're in high beta,

00:09:55.962 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:84%
you never ever get any
new information in there.

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:01.868 align:middle line:84%
So, in alpha, the
imaginary world,

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:03.203 align:middle line:84%
the inner world,
becomes more real.

00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:05.372 align:middle line:84%
And what we noticed
on our scans is

00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:09.242 align:middle line:84%
that the beta patterns
tend to slow down.

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:12.546 align:middle line:84%
We start to get these really
broad healthy alpha patterns.

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:16.283 align:middle line:84%
And the person now
is creating coherent,

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:19.086 align:middle line:90%
orderly rhythmic patterns.

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:23.523 align:middle line:84%
And different compartments of
the brain are shaking hands.

00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:26.026 align:middle line:84%
Different areas of the brain
the left side is talking

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:90%
to the right side.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.595 align:middle line:84%
The front is talking
to the back.

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:31.965 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden we're getting
this psychic union going on.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.035 align:middle line:84%
And different neighbors are
saying, she's out of the way.

00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:36.737 align:middle line:84%
Right? I mean, every
time I leave my body,

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:38.538 align:middle line:84%
the first thing my
body always says is,

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:90%
thank God he's out of the way.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.076 align:middle line:84%
And I see my body laughing
while I'm standing there

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.911 align:middle line:90%
because it's relieved.

00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:47.814 align:middle line:84%
The operators had a
chance to heal, you know?

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:51.518 align:middle line:84%
So, then exactly what happens
is that the moment that we're

00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:53.887 align:middle line:84%
out of the way, the
moment we're not our body.

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:55.188 align:middle line:84%
No longer we're not
our identity.

00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:57.657 align:middle line:84%
No longer we are not in
our environment or sort

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.193 align:middle line:84%
of putting our awareness
on the external world.

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:02.629 align:middle line:84%
The brain tends to get more
orderly and more coherent.

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:04.564 align:middle line:84%
And different compartments
of the brain begins

00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:90%
to say, he's selfless.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.101 align:middle line:90%
He's not himself any longer.

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:11.605 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's a
coherence in orderliness.

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And we start getting
this synchronization

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.242 align:middle line:90%
that takes place in the brain.

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:18.478 align:middle line:84%
And what syncs together,
links together.

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:21.948 align:middle line:84%
And when you're stressed
and insecure and emotional,

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:25.619 align:middle line:84%
that fragmented personality
keeps a person powerless

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:28.655 align:middle line:84%
because it's like having a
multiple personality disorder.

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:30.157 align:middle line:84%
But experiencing all
the personalities

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:31.925 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
we've all been there.

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:34.261 align:middle line:84%
Meditation allows that
kind of orderliness.

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:36.062 align:middle line:84%
And when the front
starts talking to the back

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.898 align:middle line:84%
and the sides start
talking to the sides,

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:39.766 align:middle line:84%
you start feeling
more like yourself

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.735 align:middle line:90%
than you felt in a long time.

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, all of the
things that you were stressing

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.273 align:middle line:84%
about no longer have
any value any longer,

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:48.475 align:middle line:84%
because you've taken
your attention off them

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
and the body settles down.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.779 align:middle line:84%
Now, that coherent
and orderly signal

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:55.549 align:middle line:84%
from the brain sends a very
coherent and orderly message

00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:57.284 align:middle line:90%
down the central nervous system.

00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Which controls and
coordinates all of the systems.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.789 align:middle line:84%
And also, the immune
system says, "Wow,

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:04.291 align:middle line:90%
that's a great rhythm."

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:05.525 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, there's a group

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:08.662 align:middle line:84%
of guys playing really great
drums and the orchestra,

00:12:08.662 --> 00:12:10.831 align:middle line:84%
the symphony now is
playing in unison.

00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:14.868 align:middle line:84%
And the cells are getting very
organized symphonic messages.

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:17.904 align:middle line:84%
So, the immune system starts
making some really healthy white

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:18.972 align:middle line:90%
blood cells.

00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:21.174 align:middle line:84%
But the digestive
system starts working.

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:22.309 align:middle line:90%
It's timing better.

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:24.644 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
the heart is starting

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:25.946 align:middle line:90%
in harmonics with the brain.

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:28.315 align:middle line:84%
And you start experiencing
well being.

00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:30.884 align:middle line:84%
And so the moment you start
experiencing well being,

00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:35.789 align:middle line:84%
you go from tissue break down
to catabolism, degeneration.

00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:39.993 align:middle line:84%
Into a state of regeneration,
anabolism, tissue repair.

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:42.395 align:middle line:84%
Even the brain cells
start growing.

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:43.463 align:middle line:90%
Everything starts growing.

00:12:43.463 --> 00:12:45.432 align:middle line:84%
Cortical thickness
starts to happen.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol levels drop.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.705 align:middle line:84%
Stress genes are
dysregulated and down.

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:54.074 align:middle line:84%
They're shut off, they're
dampered down and all

00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:56.243 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden the body starts
expressing a greater level

00:12:56.243 --> 00:12:57.544 align:middle line:90%
of health.

00:12:57.544 --> 00:13:01.014 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a sudden you
go from particle to wave.

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:03.683 align:middle line:84%
And the energy starts
to move into the heart.

00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:08.088 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden we start
seeing chakra centers lining up.

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:12.359 align:middle line:84%
And the person all of a sudden
now starts having energy

00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:90%
from the body as the mind.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.729 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
all of it's stored.

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:18.698 align:middle line:84%
The body is freed from
the chains of the past.

00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:21.401 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that happens
the side effect is called joy.

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:24.671 align:middle line:84%
And that energy starts
moving from hormonal centers.

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.741 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you're
no longer a sexual identity.

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:29.409 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer digesting food.

00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:32.946 align:middle line:84%
And you're no longer stressing
and feeling out of balance.

00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:35.148 align:middle line:84%
All those energy
centers all of a sudden

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.316 align:middle line:90%
that energy has to go somewhere.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.718 align:middle line:84%
So, it starts to
move into the heart.

00:13:38.718 --> 00:13:40.687 align:middle line:84%
You start to fall in
love in the moment.

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:42.589 align:middle line:90%
You want the moment to last.

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Your body is feeling enriched.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.293 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden your
heart starts to open.

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:48.662 align:middle line:84%
The energy starts
moving back to the brain.

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's moving out of the body

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.698 align:middle line:84%
and you're generating
a bigger field.

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:54.301 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
you will be able to focus

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:84%
on possibility because you're
taking your attention off the

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:84%
particle and now you're
focusing on the 99 percent

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.509 align:middle line:84%
of the possibility that
the atoms is made up.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.779 align:middle line:84%
And you're beginning
to select new ideas,

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:09.115 align:middle line:84%
new paradigms, knew
creative states.

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:12.085 align:middle line:84%
And so, before brain
starts to work,

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:14.854 align:middle line:84%
think constructing new
[inaudible] in the patterns.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And you see the person
moving into a creative state.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.459 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden they're different.

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
They are in a different state
of expression in their brain.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.098 align:middle line:84%
>> The key part is
you just touched

00:14:25.098 --> 00:14:29.536 align:middle line:84%
on it a bit ago is how
we intent with intention,

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:32.339 align:middle line:84%
how we begin linking up and
accessing that part of self.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:35.475 align:middle line:84%
Because that part of self also
is connected to the field.

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:36.676 align:middle line:90%
All the information is there.

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:37.944 align:middle line:90%
Anything you need can be brought

00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:41.381 align:middle line:84%
through from this self,
through to this self.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.117 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about
the link up process.

00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:46.152 align:middle line:90%
The conscious link up process.

00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:47.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well, this
is a great conversation.

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:51.358 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm speaking from my present
state of ignorance, of course.

00:14:51.358 --> 00:14:54.394 align:middle line:84%
But, we have that we have two
aspects of our consciousness.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.963 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have our
subjective consciousness.

00:14:56.963 --> 00:15:00.133 align:middle line:84%
That's the free willed
entity called you and me,

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:03.103 align:middle line:84%
that has a soul, that's on
a journey back to source.

00:15:03.103 --> 00:15:04.971 align:middle line:90%
That gets to like in this like.

00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:05.772 align:middle line:90%
Gets to be happy.

00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:06.606 align:middle line:90%
Gets to be sad.

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:07.774 align:middle line:90%
Gets to choose or not choose.

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:10.677 align:middle line:90%
It's a free willed being.

00:15:10.677 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:84%
That is our subjective
consciousness.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.182 align:middle line:84%
That's this field
around us that exists

00:15:16.182 --> 00:15:17.817 align:middle line:90%
around us beyond space and time.

00:15:17.817 --> 00:15:19.185 align:middle line:90%
It's premeasured.

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:21.354 align:middle line:84%
But it's an electric
magnetic field.

00:15:21.354 --> 00:15:23.757 align:middle line:84%
Then, there is that
objective consciousness

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.458 align:middle line:84%
that exists beyond
space and time.

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.961 align:middle line:84%
That's observing all
of this to reality.

00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:31.197 align:middle line:84%
And that objective
consciousness is very sensitive

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:32.732 align:middle line:90%
to how we think and feel.

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are electric.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.702 align:middle line:90%
And feelings are magnetic.

00:15:35.702 --> 00:15:38.138 align:middle line:84%
And how you think and how
you feel called the state

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:41.107 align:middle line:84%
of being broadcast an
electromagnetic signature

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.643 align:middle line:84%
that influences every
single atom in your life.

00:15:43.643 --> 00:15:46.413 align:middle line:84%
So if you're walking
around every day frustrated

00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:48.948 align:middle line:84%
and suffering, thinking
and feeling that way,

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.751 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying to that
objective consciousness has a

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:53.086 align:middle line:90%
subjective creator.

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:55.555 align:middle line:84%
Okay divine intelligence,
giver of life,

00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:57.757 align:middle line:90%
who endorses who I'm being.

00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:00.827 align:middle line:84%
I'm expressing a certain
level of suffering today.

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm creating suffering
in my life but bringing it away

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.465 align:middle line:90%
in that I least expect.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.201 align:middle line:84%
That surprises me and leaves
no doubt that it's come

00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:10.103 align:middle line:90%
from you, so I can suffer more.

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:11.471 align:middle line:90%
So that's karma.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:12.972 align:middle line:90%
And karma happens every day.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.908 align:middle line:84%
Because we are thinking and
feeling, in the same way,

00:16:14.908 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:84%
we keep creating the same
external environment.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.279 align:middle line:84%
We create that same
external environment.

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:22.148 align:middle line:84%
We react in the same way
of thinking and feeling.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.517 align:middle line:84%
That same thinking and
feeling then reinforces

00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:25.919 align:middle line:90%
that same environment.

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:29.322 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tango between the
outer world and the inner world.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's called karma.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.258 align:middle line:84%
Break the addiction
to the emotion.

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:35.195 align:middle line:84%
Change your habituations
of thought and actions.

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Change your feelings
that you've memorized.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.332 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, there is no karma.

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.934 align:middle line:84%
See, we're not punished
for our sins,

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:43.103 align:middle line:90%
we're punished by our sins.

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:48.308 align:middle line:84%
So then the subjective
consciousness when it marries

00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:52.345 align:middle line:84%
with or unifies with that
objective consciousness,

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:56.483 align:middle line:84%
the only way it responds
is to how we're being.

00:16:56.483 --> 00:17:00.386 align:middle line:84%
So, you don't pray for your
prayers to be answered.

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:03.322 align:middle line:84%
You get up as if you're
prayers are already answered.

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:06.426 align:middle line:84%
That state of being
is a level of energy

00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:11.197 align:middle line:84%
that transforms every
single atom in your life.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.066 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts sends
the signals out

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:84%
and the feeling draws
the event to you.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.404 align:middle line:84%
So if you're living in
a state of gratitude,

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:23.610 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying is, the
event has already happened.

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:27.113 align:middle line:84%
And now, if I start thinking
about when it's going to happen

00:17:27.113 --> 00:17:28.548 align:middle line:90%
or how it's going to happen,

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.583 align:middle line:84%
I just return back
to the old self.

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:32.485 align:middle line:84%
A new self would
never think that way.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:35.455 align:middle line:90%
So then, the marriage

00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:39.526 align:middle line:84%
of subjective consciousness
free willed you and I,

00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:41.828 align:middle line:84%
with that objective
consciousness

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:90%
who endorses who we are.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Basically, how we think and
feel, is a loving intelligence.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.202 align:middle line:90%
And intelligent love.

00:17:49.202 --> 00:17:53.807 align:middle line:84%
So then, it has an
electromagnetic frequency.

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:58.077 align:middle line:84%
And when you emulate it as
a creator in other words,

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:05.485 align:middle line:84%
you can't create from a
guilty lacking selfish person.

00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:07.453 align:middle line:84%
That's not the qualities
of the divine.

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to create,
you better emulate the divine.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.992 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
qualities of the divine?

00:18:12.992 --> 00:18:14.894 align:middle line:84%
A loving intelligence,
and intelligent love.

00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:17.797 align:middle line:84%
It's got a will that's so
much greater than our will.

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:20.099 align:middle line:84%
It has a mind that's so
much greater than our mind.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.235 align:middle line:84%
It's got a love for life
that's so much greater

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:23.369 align:middle line:90%
than our love for life.

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:25.772 align:middle line:84%
It is a consciousness
instead of awareness.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.141 align:middle line:90%
It's observant of who we are.

00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:32.312 align:middle line:84%
So then it has it has one
rule: I honor free will

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:34.314 align:middle line:84%
and I will endorse
who you're being.

00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So then when you and I
connect to that intelligence

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.652 align:middle line:84%
by changing how we
think and feel,

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:42.755 align:middle line:84%
what is the greatest
ideal of ourselves?

00:18:42.755 --> 00:18:45.124 align:middle line:84%
When you move into that elegant
state of being and you're

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.259 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:48.561 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
empowered, and divine

00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:90%
and enriched and enthusiastic.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.932 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time to
create what you create

00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:54.367 align:middle line:90%
from that state of being.

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:56.636 align:middle line:90%
You're emulating the observer.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.472 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying
as an observer.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.507 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at what
I'm observing.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:04.043 align:middle line:84%
I'm being like I'm
emulating you.

00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:07.313 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm looking you're
looking down the telescope.

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.215 align:middle line:90%
I'm the lens of the telescope.

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.885 align:middle line:84%
And let's magnify
that into our life.

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:14.053 align:middle line:90%
When that alignment takes place,

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:18.024 align:middle line:84%
then and you feel connected
to something greater.

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:20.994 align:middle line:84%
You would never try
to force the outcome.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:22.795 align:middle line:84%
You would never try to
control the outcome.

00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:24.897 align:middle line:84%
You only do that when your
living by the hormones of stress

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
because you feel severed
from possibilities.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.535 align:middle line:84%
When you are connected
and your heart is open

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:31.738 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling
something greater,

00:19:31.738 --> 00:19:33.506 align:middle line:90%
you trust in the unknown.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.907 align:middle line:90%
You already know it's happening.

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.676 align:middle line:84%
You don't know how
it's going to happen

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.677 align:middle line:90%
or when it's going to happen.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.045 align:middle line:90%
But that's not our job.

00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:42.515 align:middle line:84%
So then, there's a delicate
balance that has to take place

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:46.786 align:middle line:84%
in the creative model, between
intention and surrender.

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:49.255 align:middle line:84%
Intention is getting
clear in what you want.

00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:52.425 align:middle line:84%
But then surrender means you're
trusting in a greater mind

00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:54.961 align:middle line:84%
that infinite objective
of intelligence,

00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:56.963 align:middle line:84%
to organize in a way
that's right for you.

00:19:56.963 --> 00:20:00.466 align:middle line:84%
I always say, it's like
going to a restaurant.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.567 align:middle line:90%
You place your order.

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:02.769 align:middle line:84%
Once you place your
order, you don't get up

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.404 align:middle line:84%
and chase the waiter
around and go in the kitchen

00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:05.171 align:middle line:90%
and have someone to cook.

00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:06.372 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly.

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:08.074 align:middle line:84%
That's what we do on every
other creation in life.

00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:09.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well, you
got to place your order,

00:20:09.142 --> 00:20:10.243 align:middle line:90%
you got to get out of the way.

00:20:10.243 --> 00:20:13.046 align:middle line:84%
And in the moment you
step back in and try

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:15.281 align:middle line:84%
to control the outcome, you
just doubted your creation.

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:16.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:18.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So, this
is what's taken me so long,

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:19.919 align:middle line:90%
in my own personal life, to get.

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:25.091 align:middle line:84%
We have to have lay down the
very thing we used our whole

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:29.128 align:middle line:84%
life to get what we want for
something greater to happen.

00:20:29.128 --> 00:20:30.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:31.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza:
That's such a paradox.

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:35.401 align:middle line:84%
In the moment you step
in, it honors free will.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:40.506 align:middle line:84%
So then, the person who's the
new aged person who's saying,

00:20:40.506 --> 00:20:44.177 align:middle line:84%
"Well, I'm just going to wait
for my Maserati to come to me."

00:20:44.177 --> 00:20:46.245 align:middle line:90%
This is not how that works.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.448 align:middle line:84%
Once you move into
a new state of being

00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:49.482 align:middle line:90%
and you're creating well,

00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:52.352 align:middle line:84%
in other words only
gold creates gold.

00:20:52.352 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Lead doesn't create gold.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And our job is to take
those base emotions of anger

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.259 align:middle line:84%
and resentment and
fear and anxiety.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:03.596 align:middle line:84%
Those base emotions, and
translate them into gold.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.666 align:middle line:84%
Because right on the other
side of our pain is freedom.

00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:10.069 align:middle line:84%
Right on the other side of
our lack is wealth among us.

00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:11.637 align:middle line:84%
Right on the other side
of our fear is courage.

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:12.905 align:middle line:90%
It's the same energy.

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:14.507 align:middle line:90%
It's just trapped in the body.

00:21:14.507 --> 00:21:16.976 align:middle line:84%
And when we transmute
that energy

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:19.645 align:middle line:90%
into something else, right?

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:24.851 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have available energy to
begin to design a destiny with.

00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:28.287 align:middle line:84%
So then a person who moves into
that elegant state of being,

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:29.689 align:middle line:90%
where they're expanded.

00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:32.125 align:middle line:84%
Rich and they're
in love with life.

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:35.528 align:middle line:84%
Then, they can't go
back to the old self.

00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:37.997 align:middle line:84%
You know? Because that is
their new state of being.

00:21:37.997 --> 00:21:41.134 align:middle line:84%
So then, if you practice
that every day,

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:44.904 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later it's going to
begin to become familiar to you.

00:21:44.904 --> 00:21:46.372 align:middle line:90%
>> And you may feel it.

00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:90%
You may see things.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.775 align:middle line:90%
You may hear from it.

00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:51.811 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are means of
communications that can be set

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.079 align:middle line:84%
up as going through
that process.

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:55.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So then,
if you're creating wealth,

00:21:55.381 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the state
of being of abundant,

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.252 align:middle line:84%
you better not be
thinking lacking thoughts.

00:21:59.252 --> 00:22:01.554 align:middle line:84%
Because an abundant
person would never do that.

00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't demonstrate that
you're not making choices

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.926 align:middle line:84%
because you believe that
there's not enough lack of time,

00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:08.728 align:middle line:90%
lack of energy, lack of money.

00:22:08.728 --> 00:22:11.197 align:middle line:84%
A wealthy person would
never think of it.

00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
You can't feel unworthy
and lacking if you're going

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.501 align:middle line:90%
to be a wealthy person.

00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:17.804 align:middle line:90%
So by very logic and reason.

00:22:17.804 --> 00:22:20.173 align:middle line:84%
You got to lay that down and
move into this state of being.

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:23.042 align:middle line:84%
Now once you're in that
state of being, you can't sit

00:22:23.042 --> 00:22:25.878 align:middle line:84%
on the coach and wait
for the phone call.

00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:27.346 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in that
state of being,

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.416 align:middle line:84%
you got to start making
choices into the unknown

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:31.317 align:middle line:90%
from that state of being.

00:22:31.317 --> 00:22:33.886 align:middle line:90%
You got to trust in the unknown.

00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:37.089 align:middle line:84%
The moment you don't
make the choice,

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:38.691 align:middle line:90%
you just doubted your creation.

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:40.326 align:middle line:90%
You return back to the known.

00:22:40.326 --> 00:22:43.095 align:middle line:84%
And so, people then when
you're in that state of being,

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:44.831 align:middle line:84%
the miraculous happens
when you say, "Okay.

00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:45.898 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go for it."

00:22:45.898 --> 00:22:47.033 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going
to go for it

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:49.435 align:middle line:84%
because you're a
limited emotional self.

00:22:49.435 --> 00:22:51.404 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go for it
as your unlimited self.

00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:52.705 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
make those choices

00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:54.507 align:middle line:90%
as you step out to the unknown.

00:22:54.507 --> 00:22:56.309 align:middle line:84%
That's when the miraculous
happens, when you say,

00:22:56.309 --> 00:23:00.546 align:middle line:84%
"Oh my God, I am so glad
I made that choice."

00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
But then, waking up in the
morning then priming your brain

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.186 align:middle line:84%
and body to make that
change is the key.

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:11.958 align:middle line:84%
There's two times, the door to
the subconscious mind, opens up.

00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:13.359 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:15.428 align:middle line:84%
When we wake up in the morning,
and when we go to bed at night.

00:23:15.428 --> 00:23:17.129 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. In the
cross over place.

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:18.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza:
Because you're brain goes

00:23:18.331 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
from deep delta brain
waves to theta brain waves

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.369 align:middle line:84%
to alpha brain waves
to beta brain waves.

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:27.039 align:middle line:84%
Why? And when you go to bed
at night, it goes from beta

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.741 align:middle line:90%
and alpha to theta to delta.

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:31.644 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't get there,
you're stuck in high beta.

00:23:31.644 --> 00:23:34.447 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're driving the
sports car in first gear, right?

00:23:34.447 --> 00:23:36.782 align:middle line:84%
Some people do whatever
they can to get down there.

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:41.287 align:middle line:84%
So, the brain chemistry works
in accordance with this.

00:23:41.287 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So, when you wake up in the
morning and the receptors

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.327 align:middle line:84%
in the back of your eye pick up
light, the moment that happens,

00:23:48.327 --> 00:23:51.764 align:middle line:84%
your optic nerves sends a
signal to the pineal gland.

00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:54.534 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland
starts making serotonin.

00:23:54.534 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And serotonin is the
daytime neurotransmitter.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.606 align:middle line:84%
In other words, serotonin
gets you up and going.

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.308 align:middle line:90%
Gets your brain turned on.

00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The moment it starts
getting dark at night,

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:09.215 align:middle line:84%
and your eye is no longer
picking up physical light,

00:24:09.215 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:90%
the mechanism starts to change.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.019 align:middle line:84%
And now, because
there's less light,

00:24:13.019 --> 00:24:16.522 align:middle line:84%
the optic nerve sends a
signal to the pineal gland.

00:24:16.522 --> 00:24:18.524 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland
takes serotonin

00:24:18.524 --> 00:24:20.059 align:middle line:84%
and starts carving off
a couple [inaudible]

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:22.028 align:middle line:90%
and turns it into melatonin.

00:24:22.028 --> 00:24:25.197 align:middle line:84%
And melatonin is the nighttime,
you know, transmitter.

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:27.166 align:middle line:84%
So "ser" gets you
up in the morning

00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:30.136 align:middle line:84%
and "mel" puts you
to bed at night.

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:33.439 align:middle line:90%
Now, when serotonin increases,

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:35.408 align:middle line:84%
your brain wave patterns
go into beta.

00:24:35.408 --> 00:24:36.542 align:middle line:90%
That's because you're going

00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:38.811 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention more
into the outer world.

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:41.047 align:middle line:84%
When you're in meditation
and you close your eyes

00:24:41.047 --> 00:24:42.848 align:middle line:84%
and you eliminate light
and it's dark in the room.

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:84%
When you play music
in the background.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.185 align:middle line:90%
And you put ear plugs in.

00:24:46.185 --> 00:24:48.754 align:middle line:84%
You're getting less sensory data
coming in from your environment.

00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:51.891 align:middle line:84%
So your cortex is not so
preoccupied with trying

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:84%
to create meaning between the
outer world in the inner world.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.528 align:middle line:84%
You're forgetting
about the outer world

00:24:55.528 --> 00:24:58.297 align:middle line:84%
and the inner world is where
you're cultivating something.

00:24:58.297 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So then, when you close your
eyes and do your meditation,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.469 align:middle line:84%
then your brain waves
move into melatonin.

00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:06.038 align:middle line:84%
But if you're waking up in
the morning and you're waking

00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
up in five in the
morning, guess what?

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.177 align:middle line:84%
Your brain waves will probably
will be in theta or alpha.

00:25:11.177 --> 00:25:12.545 align:middle line:84%
That's you and your
subconscious.

00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:13.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:14.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: You
pass the beta thinking.

00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:16.115 align:middle line:84%
Right? When you go to bed
at night I have friends

00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:19.619 align:middle line:84%
that are artists and playwrights
and musicians they stay

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:20.853 align:middle line:90%
up till two in the morning.

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.822 align:middle line:84%
They love that at 11 o'clock
till two in the morning,

00:25:22.822 --> 00:25:24.657 align:middle line:84%
they're in nighttime,
they're in alpha.

00:25:24.657 --> 00:25:26.125 align:middle line:84%
You got all these
creative ideas.

00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:27.893 align:middle line:84%
There's you know me,
I'm a morning person.

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:28.995 align:middle line:90%
I wake up.

00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:30.529 align:middle line:84%
I'm up at 4:30, or
5 in the morning.

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.031 align:middle line:90%
It's my time to create.

00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:35.301 align:middle line:84%
I set aside a certain amount
of time that's my time.

00:25:35.301 --> 00:25:36.969 align:middle line:84%
Because the rest of
the day I'm serving.

00:25:36.969 --> 00:25:39.839 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to get myself
right in the morning, right?

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:44.243 align:middle line:84%
So, doing that then begins
to alter brain wave patterns.

00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:46.646 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you move
from beta to alpha,

00:25:46.646 --> 00:25:48.814 align:middle line:90%
there'll come an amazing moment.

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:51.984 align:middle line:84%
But if you do this right,
you'll slip into theta.

00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:56.889 align:middle line:84%
Now theta is when your body is
asleep but your mind is awake.

00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:57.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:57.923 --> 00:25:59.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So,
think about this.

00:25:59.125 --> 00:26:01.227 align:middle line:84%
If your body is asleep
and you've conditioned it

00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to be the mind through
addictions or habits,

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.599 align:middle line:84%
the moment the body is asleep,
it's no longer the mind.

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:08.734 align:middle line:84%
So there's no longer
any resistance.

00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's where instantaneous
change takes place.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.372 align:middle line:84%
If you go too far,
you slip into delta.

00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:14.807 align:middle line:90%
And that's called deep sleep.

00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:16.108 align:middle line:90%
Restorative sleep.

00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:17.943 align:middle line:84%
And people say to me, "Well,
I really can't meditate."

00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:18.644 align:middle line:90%
And I say, "Really?

00:26:18.644 --> 00:26:19.812 align:middle line:90%
Where do you meditate?"

00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:21.447 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, in bed."

00:26:21.447 --> 00:26:22.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, well.

00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:24.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Get out of bed.

00:26:24.183 --> 00:26:26.252 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going
to go right to delta.

00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:30.423 align:middle line:84%
So then, what we noticed
in our research to finish

00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:33.059 align:middle line:84%
that other thought is that
there comes a moment when you're

00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
in that incoherent
level of alpha.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
you slip into theta.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.533 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
when theta turns on,

00:26:40.533 --> 00:26:44.437 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden we start seeing
this amazing change take place.

00:26:44.437 --> 00:26:47.006 align:middle line:90%
The body becomes so relaxed.

00:26:47.006 --> 00:26:49.675 align:middle line:84%
And the energy center the
sympathetic nervous system

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:51.143 align:middle line:90%
switches on.

00:26:51.143 --> 00:26:53.379 align:middle line:84%
But instead of switching
on, like you're being chased

00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:55.181 align:middle line:90%
by a tiger, or switching on,

00:26:55.181 --> 00:26:57.249 align:middle line:84%
like having an orgasm
or ejaculating.

00:26:57.249 --> 00:27:00.019 align:middle line:84%
Or switching on for whatever
reason it's switching

00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:02.655 align:middle line:84%
on in balance with the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:27:02.655 --> 00:27:03.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:03.322 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: So,

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.659 align:middle line:84%
the parasympathetic nervous
system settles the body down.

00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:08.694 align:middle line:84%
But now the sympathetic
nervous system turns on

00:27:08.694 --> 00:27:09.829 align:middle line:90%
and here comes that energy.

00:27:09.829 --> 00:27:12.531 align:middle line:84%
It travels right up the
central nervous system.

00:27:12.531 --> 00:27:16.168 align:middle line:90%
And when it hits the brain stem,

00:27:16.168 --> 00:27:18.437 align:middle line:84%
switches on what's
called the thalamic gate.

00:27:18.437 --> 00:27:20.406 align:middle line:84%
The particular activating
system.

00:27:20.406 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:84%
All that energy now
hits the train station,

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.946 align:middle line:84%
the docking station,
where all the neurons go.

00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:28.914 align:middle line:90%
And boom it hits the neocortex.

00:27:28.914 --> 00:27:31.817 align:middle line:84%
And now you're producing
gamma brain like patterns.

00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:36.822 align:middle line:84%
And gamma brain waves are super
conscious brain wave patterns.

00:27:36.822 --> 00:27:40.726 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the inner
world is the real world.

00:27:40.726 --> 00:27:44.397 align:middle line:84%
The experience is so
profound energetically,

00:27:44.397 --> 00:27:46.899 align:middle line:84%
that you never forget
the moment.

00:27:46.899 --> 00:27:48.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:48.134 --> 00:27:49.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: That's when
you rewrite the program.

00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:52.838 align:middle line:84%
That lady we showed having
ecstasy taking ecstasy

00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:53.906 align:middle line:90%
in the state of ecstasy

00:27:53.906 --> 00:27:55.841 align:middle line:84%
in her meditation she
was in high gamma.

00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:57.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:58.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: We were
watching her I was watching her

00:27:58.477 --> 00:28:02.648 align:middle line:84%
go we were watching her go from
alpha, alpha, theta, theta,

00:28:02.648 --> 00:28:05.851 align:middle line:84%
theta we looked at each other
and we were like, oh no.

00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:07.887 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey and I and
all of a sudden.

00:28:07.887 --> 00:28:11.757 align:middle line:84%
Here it comes gamma
off the page.

00:28:11.757 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and this is something
that often you won't even see

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.797 align:middle line:84%
in really deep meditating
Buddhists monks, for example.

00:28:17.797 --> 00:28:18.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Exactly.

00:28:18.831 --> 00:28:19.799 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that's
where it reflecting.

00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Coherent.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Coherent.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Gamma.

00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:23.869 align:middle line:84%
So then, the moment
that happens.

00:28:23.869 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's energy.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:26.338 --> 00:28:27.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: And the
sympathetic neurosystem is now

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
in complete balance with the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.778 align:middle line:90%
The thalamic gate is open.

00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:34.313 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
is out of the way.

00:28:34.313 --> 00:28:35.581 align:middle line:90%
It's released.

00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:37.783 align:middle line:84%
And the energy is now
traveling to the thinking brain

00:28:37.783 --> 00:28:39.351 align:middle line:84%
and the person is
becoming super [inaudible].

00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:84%
You just took the dimmer
switch and went from 20 watts

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.692 align:middle line:84%
to 50 watts, which is
normal, to 100 watts.

00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:48.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:48.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: And we saw that
in all the redness of the brain.

00:28:48.994 --> 00:28:50.429 align:middle line:90%
Her brain was full of energy.

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:53.032 align:middle line:84%
And she was in a
state of catharsis.

00:28:53.032 --> 00:28:55.201 align:middle line:84%
She could control that,
but why would she want to.

00:28:55.201 --> 00:28:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, she's having an
orgasm in her head.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.638 align:middle line:90%
Her brain is having the orgasm.

00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's not chemical.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.709 align:middle line:90%
It's electromagnetic.

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:90%
It's electromagnetic.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.545 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's what happens.

00:29:06.545 --> 00:29:11.784 align:middle line:84%
The moment that happens,
melatonin has to change.

00:29:11.784 --> 00:29:13.586 align:middle line:90%
Now it starts turning into all

00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:15.454 align:middle line:84%
of these amazing
neurotransmitters.

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:16.755 align:middle line:90%
Melatonin is transmuted

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.191 align:middle line:84%
in the alchemical
factory the pineal gland.

00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:21.093 align:middle line:90%
And it makes the chemical.

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the strongest
antioxidants known to man.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.566 align:middle line:84%
In other words, just a little
tweak of the melatonin molecule,

00:29:27.566 --> 00:29:32.738 align:middle line:84%
and now you have an anti aging,
anti cancer, anti heart disease,

00:29:32.738 --> 00:29:34.306 align:middle line:90%
anti microbial,

00:29:34.306 --> 00:29:37.343 align:middle line:84%
anti neurodegenerative disease
chemical that's floating

00:29:37.343 --> 00:29:39.845 align:middle line:90%
through your bloodstream.

00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it HDH or something?

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: No.

00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:43.449 align:middle line:90%
It's antioxidants.

00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:44.884 align:middle line:90%
It's all those things.

00:29:44.884 --> 00:29:46.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:46.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: If you
stick a [inaudible] group

00:29:46.852 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:90%
and twist it and turn it.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.988 align:middle line:90%
Then if you take melatonin

00:29:48.988 --> 00:29:52.958 align:middle line:84%
and you change it again
it creates a fossfill

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:54.059 align:middle line:90%
[phonetic]luminous chemical.

00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:58.197 align:middle line:84%
The same chemical found
in the electric eel.

00:29:58.197 --> 00:29:59.265 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is that?

00:29:59.265 --> 00:30:01.166 align:middle line:84%
The neurons are just
filled with energy.

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:03.168 align:middle line:90%
And there is a glow.

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:06.005 align:middle line:84%
And the neurons now
are heightened

00:30:06.005 --> 00:30:07.406 align:middle line:90%
and they're storing energy.

00:30:07.406 --> 00:30:08.841 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gives
those colors

00:30:08.841 --> 00:30:10.976 align:middle line:84%
and patterns during
the experience.

00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:13.345 align:middle line:84%
And if you switch
that molecule again,

00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:15.648 align:middle line:84%
it turns into the
chemical that you find

00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:17.416 align:middle line:90%
in mammals that are hibernating.

00:30:17.416 --> 00:30:20.085 align:middle line:90%
In other words, no sex drive.

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:90%
No appetite.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.988 align:middle line:90%
The body's in stasis.

00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:27.192 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer having any
drives or the time to dream.

00:30:27.192 --> 00:30:28.994 align:middle line:90%
Or the time to create a future.

00:30:28.994 --> 00:30:31.597 align:middle line:84%
When the body is no
longer in the mind.

00:30:31.597 --> 00:30:34.066 align:middle line:84%
Take that chemical
and tweak it again.

00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:36.769 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most powerful
hallucinogenic known to man.

00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:39.638 align:middle line:84%
And now you're talking
about the God molecule.

00:30:39.638 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about the
inner world as the real world.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:48.747 align:middle line:84%
And now you are walking
into a dimension.

00:30:48.747 --> 00:30:52.351 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you go from
space time into time space.

00:30:52.351 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's the vision quest
or the lucid experience

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:84%
or whatever mystical moment
that has been talked about for.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:03.195 align:middle line:84%
Typically we it takes a little
bit to get people to this point.

00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:06.665 align:middle line:84%
But when the neurotransmitters
change, the chemicals are

00:31:06.665 --> 00:31:09.234 align:middle line:84%
down causation the
downward causation

00:31:09.234 --> 00:31:10.669 align:middle line:90%
of a shifted consciousness.

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:12.638 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
holy hell,

00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
because the person
will never be the same.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.075 align:middle line:90%
I've had experiences.

00:31:16.075 --> 00:31:17.242 align:middle line:90%
I understand them.

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:19.044 align:middle line:84%
And you can't go
back to business

00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:20.813 align:middle line:90%
as usual after a few of those.

00:31:20.813 --> 00:31:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. And you just
dropped it in passing early

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.920 align:middle line:84%
on that you have had these
experiences where you just had

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.455 align:middle line:84%
to say, "Oh, when I'm
out of my body " okay.

00:31:29.455 --> 00:31:30.556 align:middle line:90%
Well, woah, woah, woah hold on.

00:31:30.556 --> 00:31:31.957 align:middle line:90%
What were you saying?

00:31:31.957 --> 00:31:35.861 align:middle line:84%
So, I had assumed that, also,
this is the cross over period

00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:37.062 align:middle line:90%
that makes that kind

00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of experience available
to one, right?

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Yes.

00:31:42.468 --> 00:31:46.138 align:middle line:84%
I think, you know, my interest
is to demystify this, right?

00:31:46.138 --> 00:31:46.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:46.839 --> 00:31:47.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Right?

00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's demystify it.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: I mean,

00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:50.242 align:middle line:84%
in information you teach
people information.

00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:52.478 align:middle line:90%
You teach them how to do it.

00:31:52.478 --> 00:31:54.079 align:middle line:84%
And then it creates
transformation.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:55.581 align:middle line:90%
You can measure transformation.

00:31:55.581 --> 00:31:58.117 align:middle line:84%
That's more information to
teach transformation better

00:31:58.117 --> 00:31:59.752 align:middle line:90%
because it can close the gap.

00:31:59.752 --> 00:32:04.623 align:middle line:84%
So, excuse me in one of
our advanced workshops,

00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:07.393 align:middle line:84%
we actually did extensive
meditation.

00:32:07.393 --> 00:32:11.263 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I've realized
in my own personal experience is

00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go past the
point where you want to lay

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.368 align:middle line:90%
down in your meditation.

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:17.603 align:middle line:84%
There comes a point where
you want to lay down

00:32:17.603 --> 00:32:19.738 align:middle line:90%
and you want to give up, stop.

00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:22.307 align:middle line:84%
If you go a little bit pass
that point and you stay up sit

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:24.343 align:middle line:90%
up a little bit longer.

00:32:24.343 --> 00:32:26.211 align:middle line:90%
And then you lay down.

00:32:26.211 --> 00:32:29.348 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
early in the morning.

00:32:29.348 --> 00:32:32.217 align:middle line:84%
Because the neurotransmitters
are just right.

00:32:32.217 --> 00:32:35.487 align:middle line:84%
They're not quite melatonin and
they're not quite serotonin.

00:32:35.487 --> 00:32:36.755 align:middle line:90%
They're in between.

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:39.191 align:middle line:84%
And if you get up and do
your meditation early enough,

00:32:39.191 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and sit up for a certain period
of time and then lay down,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.028 align:middle line:84%
the light show is
going to begin.

00:32:43.028 --> 00:32:43.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:43.729 --> 00:32:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: And so,

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:49.101 align:middle line:84%
I started having these mystical
experiences a couple years ago.

00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:56.642 align:middle line:84%
And I would literally they were
so unusual that I had to go back

00:32:56.642 --> 00:32:59.011 align:middle line:84%
to my quantum physics
books and begin to look

00:32:59.011 --> 00:33:00.345 align:middle line:84%
at what exactly what
was going on.

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't taking any drugs.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:84%
My brain was the
pharmacy, in a sense.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:07.352 align:middle line:84%
And I was having these
Kundalini experiences.

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:09.421 align:middle line:84%
And I was it was like
I was getting plugged

00:33:09.421 --> 00:33:11.056 align:middle line:90%
into a light socket.

00:33:11.056 --> 00:33:14.159 align:middle line:84%
Like someone plugged me
into the electricity socket.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.928 align:middle line:90%
And I can feel every single cell

00:33:15.928 --> 00:33:18.197 align:middle line:84%
of my body turning
on all at once.

00:33:18.197 --> 00:33:20.532 align:middle line:84%
And it was like somebody
took that dial and turned it

00:33:20.532 --> 00:33:22.234 align:middle line:90%
up and it was amazing.

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:25.871 align:middle line:84%
So, there was a signature
energetically

00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:27.706 align:middle line:90%
of love that came with that.

00:33:27.706 --> 00:33:29.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:29.108 --> 00:33:30.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza:
It was the thing

00:33:30.242 --> 00:33:32.277 align:middle line:84%
that I became the
most interested in.

00:33:32.277 --> 00:33:36.482 align:middle line:84%
Because when I started having
these experiences, Regina,

00:33:36.482 --> 00:33:37.683 align:middle line:90%
the first thing I realized was

00:33:37.683 --> 00:33:39.551 align:middle line:84%
like I got this all
wrong [chuckles].

00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:41.653 align:middle line:90%
I really had it all wrong

00:33:41.653 --> 00:33:46.391 align:middle line:84%
because this intelligence
is so incredibly loving.

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:47.593 align:middle line:90%
And it's who we are.

00:33:47.593 --> 00:33:49.228 align:middle line:90%
We're just separate from it.

00:33:49.228 --> 00:33:50.996 align:middle line:90%
We're particle instead of wave.

00:33:50.996 --> 00:33:53.332 align:middle line:84%
When your nervous
system tunes into that

00:33:53.332 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:90%
and the electromagnetism comes

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:84%
with it the only way you can
describe it is that you are

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:04.209 align:middle line:84%
so present, so conscious,
and so in love with the idea

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:08.613 align:middle line:84%
of being alive that you
don't want anything else.

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:10.649 align:middle line:90%
You can't want in that moment.

00:34:10.649 --> 00:34:13.318 align:middle line:84%
Because if you started to want,
you would lose the feeling.

00:34:13.318 --> 00:34:14.887 align:middle line:90%
So, you can't want.

00:34:14.887 --> 00:34:16.388 align:middle line:90%
All you can do is be, right?

00:34:16.388 --> 00:34:19.324 align:middle line:84%
And love. So I started
having these experiences.

00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:20.425 align:middle line:90%
And then I started thinking,

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:21.959 align:middle line:84%
well maybe we should
be able to teach this.

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:24.863 align:middle line:84%
So I started to research
on the neuroendocrinology

00:34:24.863 --> 00:34:27.533 align:middle line:84%
and what it took, and then
brain chemistry at the time.

00:34:27.533 --> 00:34:32.571 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to start
explaining what the heck was

00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:33.604 align:middle line:90%
happening to me.

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:36.508 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's how
I got the involved.

00:34:36.508 --> 00:34:37.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow. I mean, this brings

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:40.144 align:middle line:84%
up so many different
paths we can go on.

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:42.613 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, we were
talking at the very beginning

00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:44.048 align:middle line:90%
about our non linear selves,

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:46.450 align:middle line:84%
that go out from space
time to time space.

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:48.519 align:middle line:84%
And you've had these
you call them slippages,

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:50.055 align:middle line:90%
back and forth between the two.

00:34:50.055 --> 00:34:51.490 align:middle line:90%
I've had some of these as well.

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.593 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences
involuntarily.

00:34:54.593 --> 00:34:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Meditation I just need
to lie down for a minute.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.199 align:middle line:84%
And you think you're
going back to sleep.

00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:02.568 align:middle line:84%
And you're rolling
in a field of plaid.

00:35:02.568 --> 00:35:04.136 align:middle line:90%
You know? Or whatever.

00:35:04.136 --> 00:35:08.907 align:middle line:84%
But, what kind of slippage were
you talking about between these?

00:35:08.907 --> 00:35:12.311 align:middle line:84%
I won't say dimensions,
into this non linear space.

00:35:12.311 --> 00:35:15.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well, I think
the biggest lie we've been ever

00:35:15.214 --> 00:35:18.417 align:middle line:84%
told is that we're linear
beings living a linear life.

00:35:18.417 --> 00:35:19.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: I just the
moment I had my first couple

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.155 align:middle line:90%
of these experiences.

00:35:23.155 --> 00:35:25.858 align:middle line:84%
I know we are dimensional
beings living

00:35:25.858 --> 00:35:28.727 align:middle line:84%
in a very dimensional
experience of reality.

00:35:28.727 --> 00:35:33.599 align:middle line:84%
And all of this indoctrination
is to keep us from that.

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:37.269 align:middle line:84%
Because once the game is
up, you can't ever go back

00:35:37.269 --> 00:35:38.737 align:middle line:90%
to being the same person.

00:35:38.737 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So, this reality this
dimension that we live

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.209 align:middle line:90%
in is called space time.

00:35:44.209 --> 00:35:47.346 align:middle line:90%
Space is eternal.

00:35:47.346 --> 00:35:50.048 align:middle line:90%
Space is the field.

00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:55.187 align:middle line:84%
And you and I experience
time by moving through space.

00:35:55.187 --> 00:35:58.523 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going to go here
to the door, I have to get up

00:35:58.523 --> 00:35:59.925 align:middle line:90%
and walk through space.

00:35:59.925 --> 00:36:02.861 align:middle line:84%
And when I walk through space,
I'm going to experience time.

00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I have an interview
later on today.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.932 align:middle line:84%
I know what's going to
happen because I'm going

00:36:06.932 --> 00:36:11.036 align:middle line:84%
to literally walk through
space to experience that time.

00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:16.275 align:middle line:84%
So, in this dimension, we could
say that space is the field

00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:18.343 align:middle line:90%
and time is the river.

00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:19.544 align:middle line:90%
And so, we move.

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:23.448 align:middle line:84%
We experience time as
we move through space.

00:36:23.448 --> 00:36:28.553 align:middle line:84%
Got it? In the inverse
reality, it's actually opposite.

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:32.424 align:middle line:84%
In other words, time
is everywhere.

00:36:32.424 --> 00:36:35.327 align:middle line:90%
Time goes on forever.

00:36:35.327 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And you experience space
when you move through time.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.039 align:middle line:84%
See I [inaudible] time is the
field and space is the river,

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:51.276 align:middle line:84%
then all of space
is enfolded in time.

00:36:51.276 --> 00:36:55.514 align:middle line:84%
So, when you change your
speed in this dimension.

00:36:55.514 --> 00:36:58.917 align:middle line:84%
If we go fast from here to
the door, the faster we move,

00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:00.018 align:middle line:90%
the less time it takes.

00:37:00.018 --> 00:37:01.153 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:37:01.153 --> 00:37:03.088 align:middle line:84%
So we can change time by
moving it through speed.

00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:06.258 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this dimension
where everything is vibration

00:37:06.258 --> 00:37:12.130 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetism, the faster
your vibration is the speed the

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.701 align:middle line:84%
different levels of
space you experience.

00:37:15.701 --> 00:37:20.572 align:middle line:84%
So, all of space is stacked
on top of each other here.

00:37:20.572 --> 00:37:23.976 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening in now
because time is everywhere.

00:37:23.976 --> 00:37:25.043 align:middle line:90%
There is no time.

00:37:25.043 --> 00:37:27.479 align:middle line:84%
So everything's happening
in this moment.

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:31.216 align:middle line:84%
And so, different
levels of consciousness

00:37:31.216 --> 00:37:33.919 align:middle line:84%
and different levels
of energy allow us

00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:37.422 align:middle line:84%
to experience these
different levels of space.

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:40.559 align:middle line:84%
So, the you that's in
the Egyptian period

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:42.327 align:middle line:84%
and the you that's
in the future,

00:37:42.327 --> 00:37:45.197 align:middle line:90%
is all lined up simultaneously.

00:37:45.197 --> 00:37:46.598 align:middle line:90%
And when you start slipping

00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.533 align:middle line:84%
through these dimensions,
you live.

00:37:48.533 --> 00:37:54.306 align:middle line:84%
And when I say live, I'm saying
that it is as real as this.

00:37:54.306 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, okay.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: You
know who you are.

00:37:56.541 --> 00:37:59.378 align:middle line:84%
And the person that you're
married to or the person

00:37:59.378 --> 00:38:02.848 align:middle line:84%
that you work with or your
best friend is wearing a

00:38:02.848 --> 00:38:04.249 align:middle line:90%
different face.

00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:08.754 align:middle line:84%
And you understand your
agreement that you negotiated

00:38:08.754 --> 00:38:09.888 align:middle line:90%
in all of those other places.

00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:12.057 align:middle line:84%
So you have a few of
those experiences.

00:38:12.057 --> 00:38:16.461 align:middle line:84%
And you start to no longer care
about your checking account,

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:19.164 align:middle line:84%
the car you drive,
what you look like.

00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:20.465 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize
that you look

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:22.467 align:middle line:84%
like somebody else
in another place.

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:27.839 align:middle line:84%
And some of the issues and some
of the challenges that you have

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:30.008 align:middle line:84%
in this life, you're
experiencing

00:38:30.008 --> 00:38:31.309 align:middle line:90%
in that exact same way.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:34.179 align:middle line:84%
And the choices you make
here affect the choices

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:35.947 align:middle line:90%
that are happening there.

00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:39.985 align:middle line:84%
And we could say that there's
only past lives and future lives

00:38:39.985 --> 00:38:43.121 align:middle line:90%
in this dimension in space time.

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
In that dimension,
there is no past life.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.224 align:middle line:90%
This is all happening now.

00:38:46.224 --> 00:38:47.592 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how else to say it.

00:38:47.592 --> 00:38:50.695 align:middle line:84%
But, as you begin to change
your consciousness, you can slip

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:53.432 align:middle line:84%
into different spaces,
different realities.

00:38:53.432 --> 00:38:56.735 align:middle line:84%
And experience aspects
of yourself that are just

00:38:56.735 --> 00:39:01.239 align:middle line:84%
like this wonderful
kaleidoscope of possibilities.

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:03.041 align:middle line:90%
>> And when we do this.

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:07.245 align:middle line:84%
When we go into what we commonly
call a past life experience via

00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:10.649 align:middle line:84%
whatever means, spontaneously
through regression or whatnot.

00:39:10.649 --> 00:39:12.584 align:middle line:84%
There does to seem
to be this element

00:39:12.584 --> 00:39:14.719 align:middle line:90%
of time associated with it.

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.388 align:middle line:84%
Because you could look it
up in the history books.

00:39:16.388 --> 00:39:20.459 align:middle line:84%
Like the young fellow,
James I forgot his last name

00:39:20.459 --> 00:39:22.461 align:middle line:84%
who was the pilot
during World War II.

00:39:22.461 --> 00:39:25.497 align:middle line:84%
Came back and went to meet with
all his mates and now they're

00:39:25.497 --> 00:39:26.731 align:middle line:90%
in their 70's and he's what?

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:27.666 align:middle line:90%
8, 9 years old.

00:39:27.666 --> 00:39:29.034 align:middle line:90%
Full memory.

00:39:29.034 --> 00:39:30.969 align:middle line:84%
And you could say,
in a linear sense,

00:39:30.969 --> 00:39:33.505 align:middle line:90%
that happened 60 years ago.

00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:34.873 align:middle line:90%
Or whatnot.

00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:40.979 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying is this it's
abstract to say there isn't

00:39:40.979 --> 00:39:42.614 align:middle line:84%
that it didn't happen
60 years ago.

00:39:42.614 --> 00:39:43.915 align:middle line:84%
Because this is all
happening right now.

00:39:43.915 --> 00:39:44.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza:
It's still happening.

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:46.017 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just still happening.

00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:47.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: He just
brought the memory from there.

00:39:47.085 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost like
a theoretical debate

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.255 align:middle line:90%
on one level, even if it's true.

00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:52.524 align:middle line:84%
Right? I mean, does it
give us some advantage

00:39:52.524 --> 00:39:54.025 align:middle line:90%
to thinking past or future?

00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:56.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: I think one
of the cool things about it is

00:39:56.361 --> 00:40:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that you can experience
future times too.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.302 align:middle line:84%
In that we think
that time is fixed.

00:40:04.302 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:90%
You know, we think it's linear.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.938 align:middle line:90%
It not fixed.

00:40:06.938 --> 00:40:12.811 align:middle line:84%
And so, you have to have
the moment to understand,

00:40:12.811 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:90%
when you have the experience,

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:20.485 align:middle line:84%
that what you are doing right
now is actually affecting all

00:40:20.485 --> 00:40:23.388 align:middle line:84%
of your past, present,
and future lives.

00:40:23.388 --> 00:40:27.792 align:middle line:84%
Your moment in your
meditation, your moment to give,

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:29.094 align:middle line:90%
your moment to serve,

00:40:29.094 --> 00:40:32.797 align:middle line:84%
your moment to love right
now affects both your future

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:34.533 align:middle line:90%
as well as your past.

00:40:34.533 --> 00:40:35.901 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
a little glimpse.

00:40:35.901 --> 00:40:38.303 align:middle line:84%
There's the point
whether it's the past life

00:40:38.303 --> 00:40:43.642 align:middle line:84%
or the now life that's in the
past, or possibly in the past

00:40:43.642 --> 00:40:46.912 align:middle line:84%
when you have that moment
of expression of self,

00:40:46.912 --> 00:40:48.914 align:middle line:90%
you bring that back with you.

00:40:48.914 --> 00:40:53.885 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge of you
as a soul is amplified.

00:40:53.885 --> 00:40:57.722 align:middle line:84%
You have more understanding
to help you execute

00:40:57.722 --> 00:41:00.091 align:middle line:84%
that this is an illusion
that we're living in.

00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:02.727 align:middle line:84%
So it no longer comes about
getting to the top of the heap

00:41:02.727 --> 00:41:05.630 align:middle line:84%
or succeeding or being
the most whatever.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.066 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden you're realizing
now it's about how you're going

00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:09.901 align:middle line:84%
to make a difference or how
you're going to contribute

00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:14.906 align:middle line:84%
or how you're going to cultivate
an aspect of self to help you

00:41:14.906 --> 00:41:16.875 align:middle line:84%
in this life and all
of those other lives

00:41:16.875 --> 00:41:18.376 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
simultaneously.

00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:21.446 align:middle line:84%
So, we've created the
conditions for this in one

00:41:21.446 --> 00:41:22.647 align:middle line:90%
of our advanced workshops.

00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:24.349 align:middle line:84%
Where the stories
are off the charts.

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:26.151 align:middle line:84%
Because people would
just get it.

00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:27.352 align:middle line:90%
They just get who they are.

00:41:27.352 --> 00:41:30.121 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you get
that when you're in sync

00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:34.626 align:middle line:84%
and that connection is in
tact you're given very clear

00:41:34.626 --> 00:41:38.229 align:middle line:84%
information regularly on
which to make decisions.

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.464 align:middle line:90%
And information flows through.

00:41:39.464 --> 00:41:40.765 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for everyone
it's different.

00:41:40.765 --> 00:41:42.667 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, "Oh my
guides are speaking to me."

00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:43.902 align:middle line:90%
Or whatnot.

00:41:43.902 --> 00:41:46.738 align:middle line:84%
It could be also our higher
selves speaking to us.

00:41:46.738 --> 00:41:49.474 align:middle line:84%
It can be an external being
speaking with a [inaudible].

00:41:49.474 --> 00:41:52.644 align:middle line:84%
Once you go into that state of
grace as it work, where you're

00:41:52.644 --> 00:41:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in that open field
of possibilities,

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:59.284 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see,
hear, simply know.

00:41:59.284 --> 00:42:01.519 align:middle line:84%
As information is being
flowed through to you.

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:02.954 align:middle line:90%
And then free will then seems

00:42:02.954 --> 00:42:06.291 align:middle line:84%
to be more how we handle
the choices to what to do

00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:09.728 align:middle line:84%
with that information as it
comes from a higher source.

00:42:09.728 --> 00:42:11.129 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well,
knowledge is empowerment.

00:42:11.129 --> 00:42:13.298 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge about self
is self-empowerment.

00:42:13.298 --> 00:42:14.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:15.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So, I'm
not talking about knowledge.

00:42:15.834 --> 00:42:18.703 align:middle line:84%
Like you may want to argue
quantum super and position.

00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:19.204 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:19.204 --> 00:42:20.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:21.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Some
people do that and I've sat,

00:42:21.673 --> 00:42:23.074 align:middle line:84%
drank martinis with quantum
physicists to sun rise

00:42:23.074 --> 00:42:25.176 align:middle line:84%
and nobody's changed
at the end of it.

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:28.813 align:middle line:84%
But having the experience
with [inaudible] which is what

00:42:28.813 --> 00:42:31.416 align:middle line:90%
that is then you begin

00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:34.886 align:middle line:84%
to realize there's a
oneness to all of this.

00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:37.322 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how else
to describe that.

00:42:37.322 --> 00:42:41.159 align:middle line:84%
But there's a oneness that
allows us to understand that,

00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:43.995 align:middle line:84%
through experience, the
mystery of who we are.

00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:48.867 align:middle line:84%
So the knowledge then becomes
the precursor to the experience.

00:42:48.867 --> 00:42:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Of but the truth is, the
biology, the neuroendocrinology,

00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.712 align:middle line:84%
the quantum physics, the
brain wave explanation,

00:43:00.712 --> 00:43:07.619 align:middle line:84%
physiology all has a
justifiable pattern

00:43:07.619 --> 00:43:10.288 align:middle line:90%
that we can begin to emulate.

00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:13.825 align:middle line:84%
We can begin to teach and
for certain times you have

00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:15.326 align:middle line:90%
to go past your fatigue.

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:17.295 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
trying to say earlier.

00:43:17.295 --> 00:43:21.266 align:middle line:84%
Like, the zen monks
that take the zen monks

00:43:21.266 --> 00:43:23.968 align:middle line:84%
and give them a [inaudible] and
make them sit up for three days

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.170 align:middle line:90%
and focus on the [inaudible].

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:26.771 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking with
their conscious mind.

00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:27.806 align:middle line:84%
And they're pushing
and and they're pushing

00:43:27.806 --> 00:43:29.474 align:middle line:84%
and they're pushing
with love and all

00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:31.443 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden they
finally surrender.

00:43:31.443 --> 00:43:32.911 align:middle line:90%
What is that surrender?

00:43:32.911 --> 00:43:36.281 align:middle line:84%
The ego finally just gets out
of the way and that's the moment

00:43:36.281 --> 00:43:38.717 align:middle line:84%
that the monk has
the realization

00:43:38.717 --> 00:43:41.119 align:middle line:84%
or the martial artist
does something amazing

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.254 align:middle line:90%
or the athlete.

00:43:43.254 --> 00:43:46.157 align:middle line:84%
Something happens that's
not a greater aspect

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:47.726 align:middle line:90%
of energy between.

00:43:47.726 --> 00:43:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So that, time stops when
that occurs because all

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.166 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden things slow down
or the moment is elongated,

00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:56.501 align:middle line:90%
is the best way to say it.

00:43:56.501 --> 00:44:00.038 align:middle line:84%
And so, when the moment is
elongated like that, you know,

00:44:00.038 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said, "Time and
space are not conditions

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.143 align:middle line:84%
in which we live, but
modes in which we think."

00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:07.045 align:middle line:84%
And [inaudible] to
time is altered.

00:44:07.045 --> 00:44:09.714 align:middle line:84%
And you have access
to more time.

00:44:09.714 --> 00:44:10.682 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles].

00:44:10.682 --> 00:44:11.483 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
I can say it.

00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:12.183 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:12.183 --> 00:44:13.151 align:middle line:90%
>> so that makes sense.

00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:14.152 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
in that state

00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:15.754 align:middle line:84%
that altered state
of consciousness.

00:44:15.754 --> 00:44:18.823 align:middle line:84%
Or you might say normal state
of consciousness where there is

00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:21.359 align:middle line:84%
that expansion and
that no thing.

00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:23.795 align:middle line:84%
Time you experience time
totally differently.

00:44:23.795 --> 00:44:24.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Absolutely.

00:44:24.863 --> 00:44:27.565 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just so there
is there is well,

00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:29.234 align:middle line:90%
there's no such thing as time.

00:44:29.234 --> 00:44:32.137 align:middle line:84%
It's just the state of
grace that is perpetual.

00:44:32.137 --> 00:44:35.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to almost jerk
yourself back into this hard

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.942 align:middle line:84%
and fast linear reality
from that place,

00:44:37.942 --> 00:44:39.511 align:middle line:84%
because what wants
to come out of it?

00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:45.083 align:middle line:84%
Yes. The real beauty of life,
the real dance is to open that,

00:44:45.083 --> 00:44:47.819 align:middle line:84%
connect with it, and
maintain it while we're living

00:44:47.819 --> 00:44:50.088 align:middle line:84%
in this linear third
dimensional experience.

00:44:50.088 --> 00:44:51.089 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:51.089 --> 00:44:51.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: I
always say listen,

00:44:51.923 --> 00:44:53.324 align:middle line:90%
you have a mystical experience.

00:44:53.324 --> 00:44:55.560 align:middle line:84%
If you can't integrate it into
your life, it's not mystical.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:56.961 --> 00:44:58.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: I mean, someone
who is, you know schizophrenic,

00:44:58.463 --> 00:44:59.964 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of mystical
experiences.

00:44:59.964 --> 00:45:01.432 align:middle line:84%
And they are mystical
experiences.

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:03.768 align:middle line:84%
But you can't function in
your world, what good is it?

00:45:03.768 --> 00:45:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So, you got to
be able to take that experience

00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:09.607 align:middle line:84%
and then methodically say ask
the question well, what am I?

00:45:09.607 --> 00:45:11.776 align:middle line:84%
Right? We're only
limited by the questions.

00:45:11.776 --> 00:45:15.513 align:middle line:84%
And then becoming possessed by
wanting to know the answers.

00:45:15.513 --> 00:45:18.016 align:middle line:90%
Wanting to go deeper.

00:45:18.016 --> 00:45:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that after a few
experiences like that,

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.823 align:middle line:84%
parts of our brain that
have been dormant now again,

00:45:24.823 --> 00:45:27.792 align:middle line:84%
this is my theory parts of our
brain that have been shut off

00:45:27.792 --> 00:45:29.527 align:middle line:90%
and dormant are turned on.

00:45:29.527 --> 00:45:33.465 align:middle line:84%
And now you're looking look
you're looking through,

00:45:33.465 --> 00:45:36.367 align:middle line:84%
you're looking through
a different lens now.

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you only
perceive what's mapped

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:39.904 align:middle line:90%
in your brain neurologically

00:45:39.904 --> 00:45:42.106 align:middle line:84%
and what you emotionally
have experience of.

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:46.044 align:middle line:90%
Emotion becomes the filter.

00:45:46.044 --> 00:45:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And the circuitry
becomes the focus.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.516 align:middle line:84%
And so then you have
an experience

00:45:51.516 --> 00:45:53.818 align:middle line:90%
of space time in time space.

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:55.720 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden you
activate the circuitry.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:00.225 align:middle line:84%
You're looking the lens
changes from experience,

00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:03.027 align:middle line:84%
and the body changes
from experience.

00:46:03.027 --> 00:46:05.029 align:middle line:84%
The circuitry changes
from experience.

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:07.732 align:middle line:84%
You're focusing on you're
not focusing on so much

00:46:07.732 --> 00:46:10.535 align:middle line:84%
that particle, you're
focusing on the wave

00:46:10.535 --> 00:46:11.803 align:middle line:90%
and the possibilities.

00:46:11.803 --> 00:46:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So your lens broadens and
your [inaudible] sharpens.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.076 align:middle line:84%
And that then alters
your perception,

00:46:18.076 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:90%
which alters your beliefs.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.279 align:middle line:90%
Which alters your attitude.

00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:23.014 align:middle line:84%
Which alters your
thoughts and feelings.

00:46:23.014 --> 00:46:24.249 align:middle line:90%
Which alters which is altered

00:46:24.249 --> 00:46:26.084 align:middle line:84%
from your memories
or experiences.

00:46:26.084 --> 00:46:27.719 align:middle line:84%
>> So, let's talk
about Kundalini then.

00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:30.255 align:middle line:84%
Where does the Kundalini
experience fit

00:46:30.255 --> 00:46:33.658 align:middle line:84%
in this whole blossoming
and moving the energy upward

00:46:33.658 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and upward until
there is a connection

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.029 align:middle line:90%
with the non linear self?

00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:39.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well, I
think you know, I was talking

00:46:39.464 --> 00:46:42.066 align:middle line:84%
about it a little bit when I was
saying, you know, to travels,

00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:45.103 align:middle line:90%
but my experience

00:46:45.103 --> 00:46:49.774 align:middle line:84%
of the Kundalini is actually
evoking a sleeping giant.

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:52.443 align:middle line:84%
It's actually evoking
that energy.

00:46:52.443 --> 00:46:55.013 align:middle line:90%
That sleeping dragon in there.

00:46:55.013 --> 00:46:59.284 align:middle line:84%
And so, if your five
percent conscious mind

00:46:59.284 --> 00:47:02.253 align:middle line:90%
and 95 percent subconscious mind

00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:05.056 align:middle line:84%
and the body has been
conditioned to be in line

00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:08.293 align:middle line:84%
and you memorize emotions
from your past, you know,

00:47:08.293 --> 00:47:09.327 align:middle line:90%
you have an experience

00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:11.095 align:middle line:84%
that creates a mood
and a temperament.

00:47:11.095 --> 00:47:13.031 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the person
because you're reacting

00:47:13.031 --> 00:47:14.966 align:middle line:90%
with one long emotional state.

00:47:14.966 --> 00:47:16.668 align:middle line:84%
And your body is
in the past, right?

00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:19.203 align:middle line:84%
So, the emotions then
run layer by layer.

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:20.705 align:middle line:90%
And the emotions are energy.

00:47:20.705 --> 00:47:22.507 align:middle line:84%
So there's all this
energy stored in the body.

00:47:22.507 --> 00:47:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So, here's five percent
and here's 95 percent.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:30.415 align:middle line:84%
So then as you begin to coax
that energy from the body.

00:47:30.415 --> 00:47:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, going
to surviving to creation

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.919 align:middle line:90%
from particle to wave.

00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:37.322 align:middle line:90%
From matter to energy.

00:47:37.322 --> 00:47:39.757 align:middle line:84%
And you have a target
to begin to elevate

00:47:39.757 --> 00:47:41.326 align:middle line:90%
that energy and draw it up.

00:47:41.326 --> 00:47:44.829 align:middle line:84%
Whether through a breath or
through discipline in some way.

00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:49.167 align:middle line:84%
You are your breath or
intention becomes the act

00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:52.337 align:middle line:84%
of using your body as an
instrument of consciousness.

00:47:52.337 --> 00:47:54.906 align:middle line:84%
And instead of letting that
energy leak out as an orgasm

00:47:54.906 --> 00:47:57.942 align:middle line:84%
or leak out in digestion or
leak out none of those are bad

00:47:57.942 --> 00:48:01.379 align:middle line:84%
by the way but if you're making
the conscious effort to turn

00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:04.215 align:middle line:84%
that energy and drive it in a
different direction and draw it

00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:05.950 align:middle line:90%
up in a different direction.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:11.155 align:middle line:84%
That the action with
intention will start

00:48:11.155 --> 00:48:12.790 align:middle line:90%
to the disturb that energy.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:14.359 align:middle line:84%
Will start to loosen
that energy.

00:48:14.359 --> 00:48:18.529 align:middle line:84%
And if you and I can get
out of the way like really,

00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:22.133 align:middle line:84%
as an identity become
nobody, nothing selfless.

00:48:22.133 --> 00:48:23.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:23.534 --> 00:48:26.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Then energy has
to go back from where it came.

00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:29.007 align:middle line:84%
And 95 percent of
where the emotions

00:48:29.007 --> 00:48:30.074 align:middle line:90%
and addictions are stored.

00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:31.676 align:middle line:84%
And the habituations
and patterns

00:48:31.676 --> 00:48:35.413 align:middle line:84%
and information are locked in
there, the particles are going

00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:37.015 align:middle line:90%
to unravel into energy.

00:48:37.015 --> 00:48:38.816 align:middle line:84%
And that unraveling of
energy is going to go

00:48:38.816 --> 00:48:40.752 align:middle line:84%
from these lower
hormonal [inaudible].

00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:41.786 align:middle line:90%
Hit the heart.

00:48:41.786 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Continue up.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.188 align:middle line:90%
Intercourse with the brain.

00:48:44.188 --> 00:48:47.191 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to draw a field.

00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:49.193 align:middle line:84%
And that field is going
to draw right back up.

00:48:49.193 --> 00:48:51.195 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to start
to create this [inaudible].

00:48:51.195 --> 00:48:55.366 align:middle line:84%
And that's the functional
creation of the university

00:48:55.366 --> 00:48:58.002 align:middle line:84%
where you become your
own individual force.

00:48:58.002 --> 00:49:00.671 align:middle line:84%
Your own individual
electromagnetism.

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.673 align:middle line:84%
And in workshops, we
show pictures of this.

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:05.943 align:middle line:84%
What people get what they're
doing is not a blind act

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.311 align:middle line:90%
of Kundalini.

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:10.314 align:middle line:84%
And we had one lady just have
the most amazing Kundalini.

00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:11.416 align:middle line:90%
One of our workshops.

00:49:11.416 --> 00:49:12.717 align:middle line:90%
I was watching her, you know.

00:49:12.717 --> 00:49:14.819 align:middle line:90%
I was watching her do it.

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:17.822 align:middle line:84%
And we do a certain degree
of discipline with it.

00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:19.957 align:middle line:84%
I was watching her and I
knew it was going to happen.

00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.959 align:middle line:84%
And that energy went
right into her brain

00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:22.894 align:middle line:90%
and then it happened again.

00:49:22.894 --> 00:49:23.728 align:middle line:90%
And it happened again.

00:49:23.728 --> 00:49:26.230 align:middle line:90%
And we sat down and had dinner.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.133 align:middle line:84%
She came and sat with for
the dinner with my staff.

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:31.669 align:middle line:84%
And she leaned over to my
assistant and she said,

00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:34.605 align:middle line:84%
"Another one of those and I'm
not going to need a husband.

00:49:34.605 --> 00:49:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> [chuckles] exactly.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.542 align:middle line:90%
Now, oddly.

00:49:37.542 --> 00:49:40.778 align:middle line:84%
I had this strange experience
with the notion of Kundalini.

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:41.879 align:middle line:90%
This was many years ago.

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:43.815 align:middle line:90%
Probably 25, 30 years ago.

00:49:43.815 --> 00:49:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was told by a
respected intuitive source,

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.356 align:middle line:84%
that not to engage
in Kundalini yoga.

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.325 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I didn't
know anything about it

00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:55.793 align:middle line:90%
so it didn't mean much to me.

00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:57.261 align:middle line:84%
Years later, not
paying attention,

00:49:57.261 --> 00:49:59.097 align:middle line:84%
a girlfriend invites
me to a yoga class.

00:49:59.097 --> 00:50:00.965 align:middle line:84%
It turns out it's
Kundalini yoga.

00:50:00.965 --> 00:50:02.433 align:middle line:84%
We're doing the breath
of fire and so forth.

00:50:02.433 --> 00:50:07.939 align:middle line:84%
But what happened to me was
that I couldn't I separated.

00:50:07.939 --> 00:50:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting next to myself.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.909 align:middle line:84%
And I can't find myself
way back into my body.

00:50:11.909 --> 00:50:13.211 align:middle line:90%
There were two of there.

00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:14.645 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't find my
way back to my body.

00:50:14.645 --> 00:50:16.047 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't find my shows.

00:50:16.047 --> 00:50:18.549 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't figure out how to write
a check or how to drive home.

00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:21.853 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a deal before I
can get it together enough.

00:50:21.853 --> 00:50:23.154 align:middle line:84%
And they just kept
the building open

00:50:23.154 --> 00:50:24.989 align:middle line:84%
until I could reintegrate
with someone.

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:26.390 align:middle line:90%
So what's happening there?

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well, I mean,
how many bodies do you have?

00:50:28.326 --> 00:50:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.728 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So you just
woke up in another body.

00:50:30.728 --> 00:50:31.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: That's all.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:33.931 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, that's
what happened.

00:50:33.931 --> 00:50:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing behind
it all is that, this whole idea

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.270 align:middle line:84%
of Kundalini's bad for
you that's an old stigma

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:40.605 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to get possessed

00:50:40.605 --> 00:50:42.607 align:middle line:84%
and there's just a bunch of
crap that goes on with that.

00:50:42.607 --> 00:50:44.809 align:middle line:84%
But listen when that
energy starts to move,

00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:46.644 align:middle line:90%
it's a moving locomotive.

00:50:46.644 --> 00:50:48.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: And if you were
going to be baptized, then fine.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.448 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you from experience,

00:50:50.448 --> 00:50:53.117 align:middle line:84%
I've had about a hundred of
cases, hundreds of experiences.

00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:54.519 align:middle line:84%
And I have been knocked
unconscious.

00:50:54.519 --> 00:50:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I have been knocked
through doors.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.356 align:middle line:90%
I have been electrocuted.

00:50:58.356 --> 00:50:59.524 align:middle line:90%
I have I mean, the list goes on.

00:50:59.524 --> 00:51:01.159 align:middle line:90%
>> It sounds fun so far.

00:51:01.159 --> 00:51:03.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: And
I can control it.

00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:04.729 align:middle line:90%
But why would I want to?

00:51:04.729 --> 00:51:06.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:06.097 --> 00:51:07.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: I mean, why
would I want to control that?

00:51:07.465 --> 00:51:11.102 align:middle line:84%
So, the first time it happens,
there's an element of fear.

00:51:11.102 --> 00:51:15.973 align:middle line:84%
Like, you are it's an
unknown, so people get afraid.

00:51:15.973 --> 00:51:19.043 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm telling you if you
surrender to it completely,

00:51:19.043 --> 00:51:23.114 align:middle line:84%
it will baptize you in a level
of energy that's off the chart.

00:51:23.114 --> 00:51:28.653 align:middle line:84%
And you can't return back to the
same self after that experience.

00:51:28.653 --> 00:51:31.155 align:middle line:84%
And when that electromagnetism
lights

00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:32.490 align:middle line:90%
up for every cell of our body.

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.625 align:middle line:90%
You know, that flash of light.

00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:36.961 align:middle line:90%
The next thing you're altered.

00:51:36.961 --> 00:51:40.565 align:middle line:84%
That is really using the body in
the proper way as an instrument.

00:51:40.565 --> 00:51:43.367 align:middle line:84%
Now you're beginning
to now you're beginning

00:51:43.367 --> 00:51:46.237 align:middle line:84%
to marry your conscious mind
with your subconscious mind.

00:51:46.237 --> 00:51:51.175 align:middle line:84%
Now we're beginning to become
more electric and less energy.

00:51:51.175 --> 00:51:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're creating a
level of coherence around you

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.948 align:middle line:90%
that creates [inaudible].

00:51:56.948 --> 00:52:02.386 align:middle line:84%
Now you're no longer living
by the laws of thermodynamics.

00:52:02.386 --> 00:52:03.821 align:middle line:84%
You're living by
the laws of energy.

00:52:03.821 --> 00:52:06.757 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care if you eat
the chocolate bar, I don't care

00:52:06.757 --> 00:52:08.359 align:middle line:90%
if you drink the poison.

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.429 align:middle line:84%
Your body is immune now
because your body is more

00:52:11.429 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:90%
of an energetic field now.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.665 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the mystics
have been talking about.

00:52:14.665 --> 00:52:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay, so.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.634 align:middle line:84%
Of all the work that
you've done.

00:52:16.634 --> 00:52:18.135 align:middle line:84%
The books you've
written and so forth.

00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.137 align:middle line:84%
Which of the books would
you recommend for people

00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:21.672 align:middle line:84%
who are listening
to this, saying yes,

00:52:21.672 --> 00:52:24.375 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a direct
relationship with my true self.

00:52:24.375 --> 00:52:27.144 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring the
Kundalini energy up and go

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:29.180 align:middle line:90%
for the wild ride of expansion.

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.416 align:middle line:84%
Or which of your work or
other work would you recommend

00:52:32.416 --> 00:52:35.086 align:middle line:90%
that people start turning to?

00:52:35.086 --> 00:52:36.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well,
as far as my work,

00:52:36.187 --> 00:52:37.989 align:middle line:84%
I think breaking the
habit of being yourself,

00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:39.290 align:middle line:90%
how to lose your mind

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.759 align:middle line:84%
and creating oneness is a
good foundation for people.

00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:45.396 align:middle line:84%
I think, though, I think
if you take that knowledge

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:46.664 align:middle line:90%
and you begin to develop some

00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:50.301 align:middle line:84%
of the meditations it'll
begin to wet your whistle.

00:52:50.301 --> 00:52:51.736 align:middle line:90%
But come to the workshops.

00:52:51.736 --> 00:52:55.373 align:middle line:84%
Because the workshops I push
people where they normally stop.

00:52:55.373 --> 00:52:57.541 align:middle line:84%
Because right on the other
side of that is the miraculous.

00:52:57.541 --> 00:53:00.911 align:middle line:84%
So, you'll learn how to do that
in our workshops that we teach.

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:03.447 align:middle line:84%
You know? And people
are doing it.

00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:05.283 align:middle line:84%
People are having
amazing experiences.

00:53:05.283 --> 00:53:06.717 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's being proven now.

00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:08.586 align:middle line:84%
Because you have all
this wonderful technology

00:53:08.586 --> 00:53:09.587 align:middle line:90%
to prove that it's happening.

00:53:09.587 --> 00:53:10.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Well, you know.

00:53:10.388 --> 00:53:11.355 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to do.

00:53:11.355 --> 00:53:13.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as I've said,
information.

00:53:13.457 --> 00:53:16.360 align:middle line:84%
If you can teach and
apply that information

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.696 align:middle line:84%
and instruct people how to use
that information, you're going

00:53:18.696 --> 00:53:20.298 align:middle line:90%
to see a transformation.

00:53:20.298 --> 00:53:23.334 align:middle line:84%
If we can measure that
transformation in EEG's

00:53:23.334 --> 00:53:29.273 align:middle line:84%
or heart [inaudible] or
coherence or whatever we use.

00:53:29.273 --> 00:53:33.044 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] that new information
that we just measured helps us

00:53:33.044 --> 00:53:34.345 align:middle line:90%
to teach transformation better.

00:53:34.345 --> 00:53:36.847 align:middle line:84%
We continue then
to close the gap.

00:53:36.847 --> 00:53:38.683 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we
start demystifying.

00:53:38.683 --> 00:53:39.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:40.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: So that
you don't have to be a monk.

00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:41.786 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be a nun.

00:53:41.786 --> 00:53:43.587 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
a spiritual person.

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:46.991 align:middle line:84%
You could be a person
that works in an office.

00:53:46.991 --> 00:53:48.125 align:middle line:90%
But you're passionate about it

00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:50.695 align:middle line:84%
and now everybody
has the access to it.

00:53:50.695 --> 00:53:53.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. Okay we only have
about five minutes left.

00:53:53.097 --> 00:53:55.199 align:middle line:84%
And one area I really wanted
to get into, but we are having

00:53:55.199 --> 00:53:58.469 align:middle line:84%
so much fun it's not
happened until [inaudible].

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:00.538 align:middle line:84%
So we all have a
possibility with our children

00:54:00.538 --> 00:54:04.375 align:middle line:84%
and our grandchildren to
essentially baptize them

00:54:04.375 --> 00:54:07.812 align:middle line:84%
into this new way of
connecting with self.

00:54:07.812 --> 00:54:10.481 align:middle line:84%
And not to accept the
societal structures.

00:54:10.481 --> 00:54:13.451 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, the
entropy that comes with it.

00:54:13.451 --> 00:54:14.752 align:middle line:90%
You've raised three kids.

00:54:14.752 --> 00:54:19.223 align:middle line:84%
What are the top tenets that
you adhere in rasing them?

00:54:19.223 --> 00:54:20.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Give children
the facts they interpret

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:21.892 align:middle line:90%
the loss.

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:23.427 align:middle line:84%
If they're young enough,
and they're brains are

00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:27.531 align:middle line:84%
so neuroplastic, their
functioning in theta and alpha,

00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:29.266 align:middle line:90%
for the most part all

00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:32.737 align:middle line:84%
that information is
going in on analyze.

00:54:32.737 --> 00:54:35.239 align:middle line:84%
So it's encoded into
subconscious.

00:54:35.239 --> 00:54:39.543 align:middle line:84%
Never ever teach your children
anything that you cannot do.

00:54:39.543 --> 00:54:41.345 align:middle line:84%
Get down there and
do it with them.

00:54:41.345 --> 00:54:44.949 align:middle line:84%
And watch this little soul
catch on as quickly as you.

00:54:44.949 --> 00:54:48.119 align:middle line:84%
Next, if you want your
children to be great,

00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:49.987 align:middle line:90%
demonstrate greatness.

00:54:49.987 --> 00:54:52.656 align:middle line:84%
They have a type neurons
called mirror neurons.

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:54.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Mirror neurons.

00:54:54.025 --> 00:54:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: Mirror neurons
are called empathy neurons.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.995 align:middle line:84%
When your feeding
your [inaudible] kid

00:54:57.995 --> 00:54:59.964 align:middle line:84%
when they were young,
you took the spoon

00:54:59.964 --> 00:55:01.966 align:middle line:90%
and you went like this.

00:55:01.966 --> 00:55:03.534 align:middle line:84%
And you were doing that
because you wanted them

00:55:03.534 --> 00:55:04.835 align:middle line:90%
to model your behavior.

00:55:04.835 --> 00:55:06.971 align:middle line:84%
A lioness who's teaching
her cubs

00:55:06.971 --> 00:55:09.240 align:middle line:90%
to hunt shows them how to do it.

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.442 align:middle line:84%
And when they watch
the lioness do it,

00:55:11.442 --> 00:55:14.211 align:middle line:84%
they turn on the same circuits
as if they're doing it.

00:55:14.211 --> 00:55:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So you can't say to your
kid, "Clean your room."

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.082 align:middle line:90%
And have a messy room.

00:55:18.082 --> 00:55:20.718 align:middle line:84%
You can't say, "Stop being
an emotional basket case."

00:55:20.718 --> 00:55:21.986 align:middle line:84%
And you're an emotional
basket case.

00:55:21.986 --> 00:55:24.355 align:middle line:84%
Because they're watching
and you're not.

00:55:24.355 --> 00:55:25.956 align:middle line:90%
And there's research to show

00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:28.692 align:middle line:84%
that when people watch sports
players, that they turn

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:31.028 align:middle line:84%
on the same parts of the
brain as if they're doing it.

00:55:31.028 --> 00:55:34.065 align:middle line:84%
Watching a great golfer
makes your game better.

00:55:34.065 --> 00:55:36.767 align:middle line:84%
Watching a great dancer
makes you a better dancer.

00:55:36.767 --> 00:55:40.905 align:middle line:84%
Watching a great parent execute
greatness makes the person a

00:55:40.905 --> 00:55:42.306 align:middle line:90%
great person.

00:55:42.306 --> 00:55:46.343 align:middle line:84%
So then, your neurons are the
fastest path to enlightenment

00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:49.880 align:middle line:84%
as a parent or a grandparent
is to demonstrate greatness

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.216 align:middle line:84%
with your children in
every area of your life.

00:55:52.216 --> 00:55:55.686 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't do it, get
down on their level and say,

00:55:55.686 --> 00:55:59.123 align:middle line:84%
"I'm trying to overcome my own
frustration and anger today."

00:55:59.123 --> 00:56:00.257 align:middle line:90%
And they will say to you,

00:56:00.257 --> 00:56:03.094 align:middle line:84%
"I'm trying to overcome
my judgment and anger."

00:56:03.094 --> 00:56:04.562 align:middle line:90%
And they will tell you.

00:56:04.562 --> 00:56:06.564 align:middle line:84%
And then say, "Okay,
let's make a pact.

00:56:06.564 --> 00:56:07.865 align:middle line:90%
Let's work on this together.

00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:09.300 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to do it?

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.769 align:middle line:84%
Let's create a strategy
and repeat it to me.

00:56:11.769 --> 00:56:12.636 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try this.

00:56:12.636 --> 00:56:13.904 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you try that."

00:56:13.904 --> 00:56:17.775 align:middle line:84%
And now you have at a
game that they're in.

00:56:17.775 --> 00:56:21.378 align:middle line:84%
And use stories as allegories to
teach them because as they begin

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:25.149 align:middle line:84%
to think about and associate
and plan their behaviors

00:56:25.149 --> 00:56:27.017 align:middle line:84%
through the allegory,
they'll identify

00:56:27.017 --> 00:56:28.586 align:middle line:90%
with them in characters.

00:56:28.586 --> 00:56:30.921 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand what
your child's limitation is

00:56:30.921 --> 00:56:34.124 align:middle line:84%
and you tell them a story of a
little child in a mystical land

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:37.528 align:middle line:84%
in a faraway place, that
overcomes something.

00:56:37.528 --> 00:56:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And you take them through the
process of how they did it.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.299 align:middle line:90%
They will demonstrate it.

00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:45.102 align:middle line:84%
Because you're installing
the circuits in their brain.

00:56:45.102 --> 00:56:47.037 align:middle line:84%
To allow them to
follow that path

00:56:47.037 --> 00:56:49.607 align:middle line:84%
because now the knowledge
is there.

00:56:49.607 --> 00:56:51.976 align:middle line:84%
>> They're a mirror,
essentially.

00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:54.411 align:middle line:84%
For their experience
around the mirror neurons.

00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:57.147 align:middle line:84%
I had not heard the term
mirror neurons before.

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:58.782 align:middle line:90%
Okay, one last question.

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:00.284 align:middle line:90%
A couple minutes left here.

00:57:00.284 --> 00:57:04.255 align:middle line:84%
You have traveled in the
past the past as we call it.

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:06.090 align:middle line:90%
The near future into the now.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.159 align:middle line:84%
But what looks like would appear
to be the future you're looking

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:10.327 align:middle line:90%
at these children now.

00:57:10.327 --> 00:57:12.062 align:middle line:84%
We are looking at
what happened to them.

00:57:12.062 --> 00:57:15.299 align:middle line:84%
How do you see in terms of
all this ability to express

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:19.803 align:middle line:84%
and create the humanity
of the future.

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:21.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Joe Dispenza: I think there's
a strong intellectual division.

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:24.308 align:middle line:84%
Some children are lost in the
[inaudible] of technology.

00:57:24.308 --> 00:57:28.979 align:middle line:84%
And the emotional rush they
get from dope I mean, texting

00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:31.315 align:middle line:84%
and adrenaline from
computer games.

00:57:31.315 --> 00:57:34.285 align:middle line:84%
They're going to look
for things in their life

00:57:34.285 --> 00:57:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to make them pleasurable
and happy.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.888 align:middle line:84%
And the crisis from
that happens.

00:57:37.888 --> 00:57:39.557 align:middle line:84%
They're going to start
using things outside

00:57:39.557 --> 00:57:40.858 align:middle line:90%
of them to change.

00:57:40.858 --> 00:57:44.061 align:middle line:84%
The other half of children
are asking bigger questions.

00:57:44.061 --> 00:57:45.262 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this?

00:57:45.262 --> 00:57:46.397 align:middle line:90%
How did we end up here?

00:57:46.397 --> 00:57:47.698 align:middle line:90%
What is the meaning?

00:57:47.698 --> 00:57:50.134 align:middle line:84%
And those kids are
more sensitive.

00:57:50.134 --> 00:57:51.535 align:middle line:90%
They're more in touch.

00:57:51.535 --> 00:57:52.770 align:middle line:90%
They're more ethics based.

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.940 align:middle line:84%
They can care less
about the same things

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:57.508 align:middle line:90%
that adults our age care about.

00:57:57.508 --> 00:57:58.809 align:middle line:84%
They don't care about
competition.

00:57:58.809 --> 00:57:59.977 align:middle line:90%
They don't care about success.

00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:00.911 align:middle line:90%
They care about meaning.

00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And meaning equals values.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.583 align:middle line:84%
And I think that other
half those children

00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:07.952 align:middle line:84%
that are interested
in values will begin

00:58:07.952 --> 00:58:09.153 align:middle line:90%
to really change the paradigm.

00:58:09.153 --> 00:58:09.954 align:middle line:90%
And they're our future.

00:58:09.954 --> 00:58:11.822 align:middle line:90%
So, invest in them.

00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Invest in their ideas.

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:14.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that what your
kids are like?

00:58:14.558 --> 00:58:15.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Yes.

00:58:15.259 --> 00:58:16.327 align:middle line:90%
I have pretty cool kids.

00:58:16.327 --> 00:58:17.728 align:middle line:90%
>> [chuckles] my son too.

00:58:17.728 --> 00:58:19.663 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the people I most
admire for being brave enough

00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:22.166 align:middle line:84%
to let the moment just
show itself to him.

00:58:22.166 --> 00:58:23.334 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: Absolutely.

00:58:23.334 --> 00:58:24.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:58:24.468 --> 00:58:25.202 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:58:25.202 --> 00:58:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Joe Dispenza: All right.

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:27.371 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:28.572 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:58:28.572 --> 00:58:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I hope these conversations
have given you a new,

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.542 align:middle line:90%
more comprehensive view

00:58:31.542 --> 00:58:33.577 align:middle line:84%
of evolving your
own brain and mind.

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:36.580 align:middle line:84%
You might want to go back to my
previous interview with Dr. Joe,

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.282 align:middle line:84%
which addresses evolving

00:58:42.152 --> 00:58:43.887 align:middle line:84%
Some call the mind
the final frontier.

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:45.956 align:middle line:84%

be the gate keeper

00:58:45.956 --> 00:58:47.725 align:middle line:84%
of what goes in and

00:58:47.725 --> 00:58:48.859 align:middle line:90%
