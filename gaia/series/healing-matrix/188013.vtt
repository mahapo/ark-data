>> How can deep pain
change your life?

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.760 align:middle line:10%
How might fear
propel you farther

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:10%
than you ever could
have imagined?

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:10%
Why is intuition one of the
most important tools for women

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:10%
to survive and thrive?

World renowned health and
transformation expert,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Danette May, is here
to tell her story

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
about how reaching
rock bottom was

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
a stepping stone to radically
changing her life, health,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.660 align:middle line:90%
relationship, and career.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Her international company

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:90%
seeking transformation.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Wow, Danette, it's
great to have you here.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
with us today.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm excited to be here.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's hear your story.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's start off
with, just tell us

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about where
everything began for you.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I think my story begins
where a lot of our stories

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:10%
begin.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:10%
You know, a little girl growing
up in a small town in Idaho.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:90%
I have four older brothers.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, the world's
at my feet, right?

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I can choose and go
in the directions.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But like all of us, I was hit
with different levels of pain,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:90%
different levels of challenges.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I was raised
in a very strict religion.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And from-- as a
personality that I am,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:90%
I follow a lot of the rules.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I was doing
everything right

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:84%
to be that perfect
little girl, to live

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
in to the dreams of my parents,
my brothers, my community.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And what it did, is it
led me into a marriage

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't quite
sure was my resonation.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It was more of this is
the right thing for me

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:90%
to do for religion.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And got married, even
though everything

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:84%
in the fiber of my being
was like terrified.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I was even like sick
on my wedding day.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:90%
When I went to go get my--

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:84%
you know, you get your
wedding certificate?

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I literally thought a
block from it, I was like,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:90%
can we do this on another day?

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, he's like, OK.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, we--
because my intuition

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
was just like raging
of just fear, right?

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And so, we got married.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:10%
Had a beautiful girl.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:10%
And then I got pregnant with my
second child, which was a boy.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:10%
And ended up losing him.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was my really my
first lowest rock bottom.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And then had a surprise
pregnancy with my third,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:90%
which was my daughter.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And my world was
crumbling at this point.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know I
was pregnant with her.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And found out, lies in
my relationship, things

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that I probably should have
seen but I was shoving down,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:90%
because I was just on autopilot.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And ended up going through
a really hard divorce.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Going through depression
after losing my son.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And found myself
$47, single mom.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:10%
Sold all my furniture, so there
I was, sleeping on the floor,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:10%
eating beans and
weenies, trying to take

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:10%
care of these two girls.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a lot.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.705 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, many of our viewers
maybe have experienced one

00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:90%
of these things, maybe two.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:90%
You spoke about intuition.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And can you tell us
something about--

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:84%
you shared with us
earlier about an intuition

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.242 align:middle line:84%
that you had during your
pregnancy with your son.

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.588 align:middle line:84%
>> And can you just tell people
what happened for you there?

00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
going to be impactful.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What I do want to say is that
each one of us have intuition.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like
some people have it

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
go search for it.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
It's always talking to you,
whether it's in maybe just

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:84%
a hunch in your mind, or
a sensation in the body.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I was
pregnant with my son.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And just like all new moms,
you find you those moments

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
where you're alone, and you get
to feel the baby kick, right?

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was far enough along that
my baby was kicking regularly.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- I remember
the day, because I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
was sitting in the living room
and it was actually quiet.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
the snow was out.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting in
the rocking chair.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And I put my hand on
my belly, and it was

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:90%
like, I don't feel anything.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first moment I
knew something could be wrong.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But of course, if
you're on autopilot,

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're really good at
turning off your intuition

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:84%
to keep your life in the
same pace it's been going,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:90%
you find a distraction.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So I just, eh, that's just my
brain playing tricks on me.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So I started to move
my belly around,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
trying to see if I
could wake him up,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:90%
and didn't feel anything.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like that
game on your shoulders,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
where one voice is
like, something's wrong.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.195 align:middle line:84%
And then the other voice is
like, you're just paranoid.

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't be negative.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I know now,
which I didn't know then,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:84%
is that I was so good at
turning off my intuition,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
because my intuition was
talking about my beliefs,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
my daily actions, my
relationship with my spouse.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.755 align:middle line:84%
And if I started listening
now to my intuition,

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I was going to disrupt
everything in my life.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Where would it stop, right.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think a
lot of us do this.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
We're afraid to really
listen to that intuition,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.012 align:middle line:90%
because what does that mean.

00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
That means I have
to make a change.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> My world's going
to collapse around me,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:90%
just because of this.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so what I did, is I got
up and went and did the dishes.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that ended up
spiraling into obviously I lost

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:90%
my son.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'm not
going to say that had I

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
gone to the hospital in that
moment, maybe he would be here.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to put that
on me, nor should anyone.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good
reminder, always, for me,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:90%
is like that voice knows.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
That intuition in
your cells it knows.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And can I stand in it,
even if it's uncomfortable?

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Can I honor it, even if
it's going to disrupt

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:90%
the current flow of my life?

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned that you were
raised in a strict environment.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And that maybe religion had
something to do with that.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you know, and the
reason I'm willing to share all

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
this, and it's not to say that
one religion's wrong or right,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:84%
or any of that context, I
share this because I believe

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:84%
we're all raised to
some degree like this.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:90%
We're born fully free.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And then to the good intent
of our parents, good intent

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.830 align:middle line:84%
of our community, we're
imposed with the beliefs

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.670 align:middle line:90%
that they carry.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in an attempt
to take care of us.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally, our safety.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Safety in the physical
realm and the safety

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual realm, right?

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you're imposed
with these belief systems,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and you're really taught--
you've got to follow this,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is how we
do it, and there's

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
really no why, it's
just this is how

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:84%
it is, even though your
intuition is telling you,

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:84%
oh, maybe I don't
actually believe that,

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
or I actually want
to go do this,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're telling me to do
this, or I want to eat this,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.147 align:middle line:84%
and you're telling
me we can't eat

00:06:51.147 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
this, because this doesn't
abide with our religious views,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the story is.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
You get really good at
like just switching off

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
your own inner
knowledge to follow

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
the streamline of the tribe.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Because none of us don't want--

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:90%
none of us want kicked out.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
All of us want a
seat at the table.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
We want to all be invited to
the popular table, or the family

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:90%
table, or whatever table.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Please the big people.

00:07:14.265 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:90%
They're feeding us, right?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so that's really
where I picked it up.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's also where I
learned to shut it off--

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:90%
And

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When we shut it off, we know
now that that leads us down

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
a pathway that ultimately
will create pain in our lives

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
in some form, which will
ultimately be a wake-up call.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can also
receive pain even following

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:84%
our intuition, and there's
really no wrong path.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I think the path--

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
all paths, even if they feel
quite destructive, or painful,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
or even abandonment, all
these different paths

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
will ultimately, I think,
lead to our ultimate destiny.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's just, we really might
just go on a different journey.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate destiny, I
think, we'll end up being at,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:90%
all of us.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And it leads to this really
dramatic moment in your life.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Are you able to share with us
what happened with your son?

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I wish I had details,
because what happened is I

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:90%
started bleeding.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Go to the hospital,
they're running around,

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and they basically are like
your son has passed on.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:90%
So I have him.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.068 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
quite sure if he's--

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking
there's a heartbeat.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But then-- and all of it's
quite-- it's interesting also,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:90%
the human spirit.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So I do want to speak to
this, because as humans we

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:84%
get ashamed if we go
through traumatic events

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and we can't
remember everything.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well--

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> We feel a sense of shame.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.379 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a survival
instinct for sure.

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:90%
It's built in.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So I do want to just say
and own my vulnerability,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.470 align:middle line:84%
there are moments I
cannot quite remember.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Because we went there, bleeding.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the
baby has passed.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing that maybe it's not.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:90%
So they induce me to have him.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.465 align:middle line:84%
And all I remember
is the nurses,

00:08:54.465 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
literally in this
moment, and I'm

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
going to speak to this because
you know hospital rooms,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:90%
they're very white.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:90%
There is a beeping sounds.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:90%
There was chaos going on.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And I remember after I had my
son, and they rush him out,

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:84%
all I remember is these same
nurses coming into the room,

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
but it felt very
angelic in there.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is not
everyone's experience

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
who's lost a loved one, but
for me it was so profound,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:84%
it would be amiss not
for me to talk about it

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and use my voice to say there
was something special going on

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:90%
in that room.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And even this doctor,
who was very analytical,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:84%
was with me through the whole
pregnancy, just this journalist

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
type personality, like seemed
like an angel sitting next

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And he just let me know
my baby had passed.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
They weren't sure
what's going on.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to do some
tests, because they

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:84%
were concerned that maybe
they had done something.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
He was wondering if the baby
had picked up some infection

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:90%
from the nurses even.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
He was like can we
do some tests on him.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, I was like sure.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And when he came back
with the test results,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:84%
he's like we cannot
pinpoint what went on.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
He's like there's a slight
infection in his lungs,

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
but it's not enough to
say, oh, we did that

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:90%
at the time of birth.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very big.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to
really take that in.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
great lesson for me,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and a great lesson
for all of us,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that even if we
don't have answers,

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean there's not
a beautiful gift wrapped up

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And as my life has, unfolded
he's been such a huge gift.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I'm
always sharing with people that

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:84%
has tremendous impact
on this very topic,

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a soul
contract that's happening,

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
there's conversation-- as if
there's conversation before we

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
even come in that we're going
to help each other wake up

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:90%
to certain things.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And it very well could be that
when you met at the bus stop,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:84%
before you came here, that
the agreement was I'll

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:90%
help you awaken.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to come
in for a short moment,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.480 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll be on my way.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.628 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be off to
do your real purpose

00:10:54.628 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, which it sounds
like you're definitely--

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So beautifully said, and I've
never heard anyone say it like

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.060 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:90%
I really have felt like that.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I just hadn't articulated in
such a beautiful way, of, yeah,

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:90%
I feel he came in.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
He literally passed
away to wake me up.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, kind of a nudge,
like go down this path.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Without this, you might
not find that path, because

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
of the deep pain
that is generated

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:84%
in a moment like that,
that causes us to have

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:84%
a re-evaluation, what you call
gifts in a certain manner,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:90%
presented in a certain manner.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.365 align:middle line:90%
And maybe you share--

00:11:29.365 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I call them gifts.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this from other
people that I've aspired to,

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:90%
but gifts wrapped in sandpaper.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's not
a comfortable gift.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not it's pretty bow.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But it is a gift,
in and of itself.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a soulful purpose
here, in all things that are

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
happening in our lives,
that are unfolding,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:84%
each of them seemingly,
in your situation,

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
to nudge you toward
this message of hey,

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
there's something going on
inside of us that we cannot

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:90%
ignore.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> If we do, it leads to
great pain, devastating pain.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And when we do, we heal.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And can you say
any more about that?

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:84%
The revelations that
have happened for you?

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The big revelations for
me right now have really been

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
around honoring my intuition,
really listening with fine

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:90%
tenuity.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I have to say,
for anyone who's in their fall,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:84%
or in their pain,
or what we call

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
rock bottom, that's actually
an awesome space to be in.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is, is
because at that point,

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:90%
you actually don't care anymore.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.652 align:middle line:84%
You actually have let
go of all your ego.

00:12:35.652 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:84%
You've let go of wondering what
someone is thinking of you,

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:90%
because you're at that bottom.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You've messed up
so bad, you're there.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.528 align:middle line:84%
And so then all you
have is up to go.

00:12:44.528 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's actually
a very beautiful place.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And there are books
about this, about power

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:90%
coming from the rock bottom.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:90%
And so harness it.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Use it.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.213 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
you don't care anymore.

00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in quantum science, it's
referred to as this great void.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually the place
where ultimate creativity is,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:84%
that we can become
anything in that moment

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.082 align:middle line:84%
when we let go of the beliefs
that we were carrying around

00:13:07.082 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
or that we were trying to fit
into, who we thought we were.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When that falls apart, or if
we surrender it consciously--

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.882 align:middle line:84%
usually it's a fall
apart, but either way,

00:13:16.882 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
when we land in that, not
knowing that we're actually

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
in the most powerful
place of all time.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So for you, what were
the beliefs that came apart,

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that came unraveling as
you were dropping in?

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
What were you
starting to realize

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.917 align:middle line:84%
was rearranging in
this great swirl

00:13:34.917 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:90%
downward toward the rock bottom?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, pretty much
every single belief.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And I actually believe
I'm still in the swirl.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, may we
always be growing.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I may always be in the swirl.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Just learn how to swim
and navigate it, right?

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I was
just starting to go--

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I was in this place
of, you know what?

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't care anymore.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
The ego's dismantled.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Everything is dismantled
at this point.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a state of
depression or rock bottom,

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:90%
it just dismantled.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I started
looking at what

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:84%
are the beliefs I'm
believing regarding religion?

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Regarding the clothes I wear?

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Regarding the
company that I keep?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:90%
The activities I do?

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Just because someone said
that this is right or wrong

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.355 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make it so.

00:14:18.355 --> 00:14:19.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it mine?

00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that mine?

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that mine?

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Or is it just something that
someone lent to me at a time

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:90%
when I was growing?

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so it was a
big unraveling for me.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And I imagine an outsider--

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just-- my family
was one at the time,

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
was like, oh, she's
in her unraveling.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
She'll come back to
herself eventually.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I was dismantling
my views on everything.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:90%
And really looking at it.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
feeling such deep peace,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
but to everyone
else around me they

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.897 align:middle line:84%
thought I was just
losing my mind.

00:14:50.897 --> 00:14:51.697 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:51.697 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I was getting more peaced
out and they were getting

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.505 align:middle line:90%
more worried about my sanity.

00:14:56.505 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I wasn't fitting
into the rules anymore.

00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't fitting into
their beautiful box

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and it was terrifying
for people,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:84%
because I was just
dismantling it all.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Oftentimes, people hear that
our beliefs have to change,

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that our beliefs
are containing us.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But people don't really
walk around knowing

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:90%
what their beliefs are.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
inside it already.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.632 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of stuck in there.

00:15:17.632 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So just give us an
example of a belief

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.670 align:middle line:84%
that you suddenly
realized, I just,

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that any more.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- that's not mine.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Does an example come to mind?

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm going to go--

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a
religion example,

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle line:84%
because I think we all have
some form of that in our DNA.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have a very
thick in my DNA.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's definitely been
imprinted for a few thousand

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.290 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And for me, like
for example, I'm

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
pretty much in
compliance of what I

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.730 align:middle line:90%
would have worn religion wise.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But you definitely
didn't wear short shorts,

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and you didn't wear tank tops.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And during the summer, I
was always blazing hot.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And I always wanted
to wear a tank top.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:84%
But I was told that that
was actually very immodest.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking at
these belief systems,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
going am I-- is my
intention immodest

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:90%
when I wear this tank top?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.582 align:middle line:90%
I'm just hot.

00:16:07.582 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to wear a
tank top, because I'm hot,

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:90%
and I'm in the yard.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Huh-- I'm taught that I
actually am revealing too much

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.072 align:middle line:90%
and I'm trying to be too sexy.

00:16:17.072 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:90%
But that is not my intention.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not my truth.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And so listening to what is
my intention with what clothes

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:90%
I wear.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Or what is my intention
in this relationship?

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Do I love this person?

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Do I want to do life to them?

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Do I choose them?

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.032 align:middle line:84%
Or am I marrying this
person or with this person

00:16:34.032 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
they're going to get me

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:90%
somewhere spiritually?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Or because it fits within
the guidelines of my parents?

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So these are examples
of the stories

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that you can start to
unravel, going, huh, this

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:90%
is an interesting rule.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it really--

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it really true?

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> --true?

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it's an
interesting thing,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want to
question the people that we

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.962 align:middle line:84%
love, that raised us, the
people that we respect,

00:16:55.962 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:90%
that we have a regard for.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't want to question
them, out of love and loyalty.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, if what was

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.447 align:middle line:84%
working for them
isn't working for us,

00:17:04.447 --> 00:17:06.114 align:middle line:84%
we have to reconcile
that at some point.

00:17:06.114 --> 00:17:06.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:06.914 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Otherwise, we
begin to implode.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And we get
disease in our body.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What was happening for you
when you were at that lowest

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:84%
point, of having not
been listening to that?

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe that?

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, just when I wasn't
listening, obviously there's--

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
now, I'm going to speak
to the emotion that

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.817 align:middle line:84%
can come up and
see if anyone can

00:17:28.817 --> 00:17:30.025 align:middle line:90%
resonate with these emotions.

00:17:30.025 --> 00:17:30.825 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>> One, you feel sick.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Usually people that are not
listening to that intuition,

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
or just following what
everybody wants for you,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.343 align:middle line:84%
you tend to get either
sick in the body.

00:17:40.343 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
You can even feel it
in your lower back,

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
because that's unresolved
anger, that you're

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:90%
like not expressing yourself.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
You can even feel it,
things in the neck.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
you can feel angry.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So for me, this is how
mine was being expressed.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling things in my
body, but I was also really good

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:84%
at taking care of my body
to try to mask those things.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So there was like
interesting anger.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not actually an
angry person, naturally.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:90%
But I was feeling rage.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:90%
So look at that.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're getting rage, starting
to just come through you,

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
look at that.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
That's actually something
trying to communicate itself

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:84%
to you, this irritability,
anxiousness, depression.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Some people experience
a sense of depression.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So these are some
signs of what comes up

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:90%
when you're in your experience.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I call it the rising
of the essential self.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.767 align:middle line:84%
The soulful self
is trying to rise.

00:18:31.767 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:90%
And if we keep pushing it down--

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, of course
that energy's going to--

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:84%
at some point we're
here to break through.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:90%
So here it comes, ready or not.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:84%
We'd like it to be more
graceful than not, ideally.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>> To reflect internal conflict,
in addition to back pain

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
or neck pain what about other
emotional states as well,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
other than anger and
rage, that are rising?

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Are there other things
that you witness regularly

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that are happening,
that you feel

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
are a part of this denial of
the intuitive self rising?

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, like I said,
depression can be one of them.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:84%
That state of like
kind of low on energy.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:90%
People have trouble sleeping.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one,
especially now.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing this happen
today, is that people are all

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:90%
about how do I sleep better?

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And I want to propose the
question to people is,

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
like how can you get more
into your soul's contract

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.280 align:middle line:90%
or your soul alignment?

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe if you
start to look at that,

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
you're sleeping is
going to be 10 times

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
better, versus doing all the
things, taking all the pills.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So really looking and
honoring these things.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are so equipped
to be so functional.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:90%
They're such functional beings.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not sleeping,
or you're feeling anxious,

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:84%
or you're feeling lots
of fatigue all the time,

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:84%
check into the emotional
state of where you may be.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
What are some truths
that maybe you're

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:84%
taking on that are
not your truth?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Or what are these, what
relationships are you keeping?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.617 align:middle line:84%
What actions are you doing
that you're like that

00:19:59.617 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:90%
actually doesn't serve me?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
These rituals, these
daily actions from A to B,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
by the time I close my eyes,
they're not serving me.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Look at all of it.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:90%
How is your day being spent?

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And when do you start
to feel that fatigue?

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.212 align:middle line:84%
When do you start to
feel that anxiousness,

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:90%
or depression, or sickness?

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.853 align:middle line:90%
Look at those patterns.

00:20:14.853 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
only be-- you have

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.535 align:middle line:90%
to be your own rescue, right?

00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We all have to be
our own rescue.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
like how did you do it?

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It was that.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It was like picking
apart every little piece.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, if I'm all plugged
into shutting it out,

00:20:26.755 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and tuning it out, and
doing the right thing,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and being a good person,
and the perfectionist,

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and being a good daughter,
and a good sister,

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and a good whatever, if I'm
caught up in that right now,

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of feel it, and I'm
listening to this conversation,

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and I know that I need to
listen to my intuition,

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.577 align:middle line:84%
how am I going to
know what that is?

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:90%
What's it feel like?

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:90%
What's it sound like?

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:84%
What's going on right
there, specifically,

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to be able to
start to honor and build a more

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.032 align:middle line:90%
robust loving relationship?

00:20:55.032 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> With your intuition?

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's some things I
think you need to do to start.

00:21:00.373 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, I think a lot
of us are like, hey,

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:90%
what does it feel like?

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060 align:middle line:90%
What does it sound like?

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.195 align:middle line:90%
What does it do in the body?

00:21:06.195 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And before I can speak to that,
I need to speak to the silence.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And I reference this in my
book, because the beautiful part

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
about going through
what I went through

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
is, all the people in my
life kind of just dissipated.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.335 align:middle line:90%
So I was left with myself.

00:21:20.335 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually
a gift in itself.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have TV.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I was broke as a joke, so
there was no TV, no cable.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I had a flip phone, so there
was definitely no like really

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:90%
looking at a lot of things up.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of-- no people
coming in and out of my life.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Like, I wasn't going out with
girlfriends for a coffee date

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.197 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't doing those things.

00:21:37.197 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's beautiful,
beautiful gifts in that.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And so really, taking the
time to turn off the noise.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.025 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's so
scary for a lot of us.

00:21:46.025 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:84%
That's because your spirit's
trying to talk to you.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:90%
And your ego's like no, no, no.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:90%
So as soon as you--

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee every person
listening right now

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:84%
has had this moment, where
you're like I really want--

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I feel that something's coming,
like some knowledge is coming,

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and you immediately
grab your phone.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Or you're like, oh, I'm
going to call my friend,

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to
go turn on the TV.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And they drowned it out with
news or background noise,

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's the ego
trying to keep it all down.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
is to go, where

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:90%
can I like turn off the noise?

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.422 align:middle line:84%
And maybe go for
a walk in nature,

00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
if you need to get
out of the home,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:90%
get out of the distractions.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't really get
into the power of knowing what

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that intuition is until the
noise is somewhat silenced.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
be the first step,

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:90%
is just turning off the TV.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Especially phones, right now,
that they're attached to us,

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:90%
really being conscious of that.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And then simply asking, simply
in that silence, asking,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:90%
what would you have me know?

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that has
taken my business and my life

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:90%
completely to the next level.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:84%
People ask how did
you go from $47

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.058 align:middle line:84%
to this eight figure
business in five years?

00:22:55.058 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Because people want to
know financial stuff

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
all the time, which I'm
like it's soul time.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, sitting
down in the quiet,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and asking what would
you have me know?

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.683 align:middle line:84%
And then writing down whatever
comes up, that is intuition.

00:23:08.683 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of it will
feel like gibberish.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of it will be like harder,
until you get more seasoned.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like training any
muscle in your body.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Your soul, I trust her.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
She's going to sit here
and let me speak to her.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Not going to abandon again.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so ask what would you
have me know, and then listen.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Write it down, but then also
pay attention to your body.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give
some just basic ones

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
that I'm feeling that
someone might need to hear.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So a big one is
our sexual energy.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.800 align:middle line:84%
This is our creative
force, especially

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:90%
if a woman's listening.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And this was a big
one for me too,

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:84%
because I was in a
relationship, not a bad person.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not throwing my
ex under the rug.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:90%
It was just a mix match for us.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had massive
sexual discomfort.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I went to every doctor.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for every serum,
potion, lotion, to like fix me,

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
when my body was
telling me all along,

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.448 align:middle line:90%
this isn't the right match.

00:24:04.448 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not a connection.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe women get
like pain in the uterus

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
because there's a misalignment
in your creativity.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a misalignment
possibly in your relationship,

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:84%
or your belief around you,
and your own sexuality.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.127 align:middle line:84%
Or buried feelings, not
letting go of the past.

00:24:21.127 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's been
trauma in the past.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.918 align:middle line:90%
And you're not letting it go.

00:24:23.918 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:90%
It will manifest in that region.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.020 align:middle line:90%
And so that's your opportunity.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:10%
If you're feeling pain
in there, to look what

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:10%
might be going on,
in the relationship,

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:10%
your own past, that
you haven't let go of,

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:10%
and your creative center.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Another one is your neck.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.208 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people will be like,
oh, I'm so stiff in my neck.

00:24:42.208 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking, because
I'm speaking of myself,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and so I've done
all this research.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:90%
But the neck is really--

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe you're not
letting your voice out.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:84%
There's this disalignment
between the head and the heart,

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and really looking at
how can I serve my voice?

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Or am I inflexible in
decisions in my life?

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And where can I
be more flexible?

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to look
at things, the body speaking

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
to you in a sense
of emotion of what

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.168 align:middle line:84%
might be going on
in your life, you

00:25:06.168 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:84%
can just start
curing everything.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can start
feeling better too,

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
because you've taken
care of the emotion.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> What were the first steps
that you took out of this dark

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.810 align:middle line:84%
void, which we now
know was a good pace,

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:84%
but initially is
quite scary to be in?

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:84%
The event that someone watching
is experiencing that now,

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:84%
what might they look
to as a first step?

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I get this question a lot.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I always try
to feel into it,

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.197 align:middle line:84%
because that first
step for someone

00:25:35.197 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:90%
might be different than another.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.863 align:middle line:84%
Because some people feel like
they got hit over a brick,

00:25:38.863 --> 00:25:41.780 align:middle line:84%
or they had this like
moment where the sky parted,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and they feel like, oh, I know
exactly what I need to do,

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:84%
or I'm loved, or
whatever the emotion.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was just
plodding day after day.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
It was never just this
aha moment for me.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I think for me, what
worked for me was stepping

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:90%
into the things that scared me.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Because everything scared me.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Wearing a tank top scared me.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Wearing a bikini
definitely scared me.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Clothes for me was a symbol
of covering myself up.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was something
that I had taken on,

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:90%
not that someone imposed that.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But that was my way of taking
on non beliefs that didn't work

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:90%
for me, was through clothing.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I stepped into
a bikini competition,

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:84%
which to other people that
might not be a big deal.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:90%
So what is your edge?

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Like ask yourself,
what is my edge?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.460 align:middle line:84%
What would be hard for
me, but be like I'm not

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:90%
going to die if I do it.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to hurt anyone if
I do it, but it terrifies me.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you step into
fear, every single day,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.350 align:middle line:84%
or something-- maybe
it's a big thing,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:49.400 align:middle line:84%
like I put my sights out on
this world's bikini competition,

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.510 align:middle line:84%
because it literally was
me unraveling, unlayering--

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:84%
what it does is it teaches
your subconscious you're

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.730 align:middle line:90%
showing up no matter what.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you stronger
in your intuition.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:84%
It makes you stronger
in your convictions.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You also speak
about hinge work.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
what this is for us?

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, one of my
favorite quotes is,

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.600 align:middle line:90%
"Small hinges move big doors."

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And along my travels, one of
my favorite things to look at

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:84%
is these ornate, huge, dynamic
doors to castles that open up.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at every
single dynamic, huge door,

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
they're held together
by these three hinges.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>> A little hinge.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's those hinges in our
lives that are going to open

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:90%
the door to our life.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And so can you find
three non-negotiables

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
take on in your life that

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:90%
are your honoring of yourself.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:90%
They're non-negotiables.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
They're not oh,
I should do this.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It's non-negotiable.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And those are your
three hinge movements

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.640 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to do
every single day to open

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:90%
your big door.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>> So an example.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:90%
What's a hinge?

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Mine are very clear for me.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's movement,
I move every day.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:90%
We hear about rest days.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm still moving on rest day.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Rest day might be a nice
little stroll, and just prayer

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.140 align:middle line:90%
while I stroll.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.413 align:middle line:90%
So movement every single day.

00:28:07.413 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's not a rest day,
what's movement mean for you

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:90%
on a non-rest day?

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it varies.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I love moving my body in nature.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:90%
That's just for me.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Some people like classes.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:84%
SoulCycle for me
not the same as soul

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.620 align:middle line:84%
cycling out in nature
on a mountain bike.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.292 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all different, but
for me, it might be running.

00:28:25.292 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It might be, maybe
even a lifting class.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're getting
your heart rate up.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:90%
You're breathing deeply.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.940 align:middle line:90%
You're sweating.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, that really
resonates for me.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I like to get that--

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And someone else
might want ballet.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Ballet.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> or yoga.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Totally, something a
little bit more gentle.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no right or wrong.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:84%
We get-- we get into these
stories that there's one way.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's one.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.805 align:middle line:84%
The second hinge
movement is food.

00:28:48.805 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when I talk
about food, we

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:84%
can get into all these
stories around food.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.193 align:middle line:84%
All my hinge with
that is something

00:28:54.193 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that's green, and
living, and came

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:84%
from the earth,
every single day.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I consume
that food, I know

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that I made a conscious
choice, to make it green,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
make it living, make it
coming from the Earth.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:90%
And then the third is mindset.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So every single day
I say affirmations.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm such a believer in the power
of what you speak to yourself.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So it takes-- I mean,
I did it driving here.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do it whenever, just
all the time, affirmations.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you're
directing the vibration,

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:90%
you're directing the attention.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole energy that
you're going to live

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:90%
in, non-negotiables.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Non negotiables.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> My hinges.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that are
going to happen no matter what.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> This is what I'm doing.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.280 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned food.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.475 align:middle line:84%
Speak to us about
what you're working

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:90%
with regarding healing foods.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a big lover
of healing foods.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big researcher so when
people are reading other books

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.840 align:middle line:84%
at night, I'm reading all
about different types of foods

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:90%
and how they affect your body.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And not just foods
in the modern way

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.840 align:middle line:84%
of looking at it,
I'm really fascinated

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:84%
with indigenous
tribes, and what did

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.270 align:middle line:84%
they know that we could bridge
over into our modern world.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So I secretly travel
to indigenous tribes

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I study a lot of the plants,
and the different herbs,

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and the things
that they consumed,

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and why they consume them,
and what the benefits were.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, what I
consume, daily, and I really--

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.660 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that it's for
everyone, but like I said,

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.675 align:middle line:84%
something green, something
that has those vital nutrients

00:30:23.675 --> 00:30:25.350 align:middle line:90%
of green and living.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I do that
every single day.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And that might look
like spinach, arugula.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's living,
and it's organic.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not sprayed
with pesticides.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:90%
So something like that.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I always consume lemon
every single day.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:84%
There will be times when
I'm traveling someplace

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and I just can't get it, but
lemon for me balances the pH

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's just this
clicker and reminder to me

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:90%
of keeping that balance.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the third one for me
is cacao, and raw, particularly

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.620 align:middle line:90%
raw cacao.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And I like to mix
it with turmeric.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And I like to mix it with a
little bit of MCT, and lucuma,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and mesquite, because all
those-- and cinnamon--

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.240 align:middle line:84%
because all of those are
like a really combined elixir

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:84%
to really help, with love, the
feeling of anandamide and love

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
in your body, theobromine
for the brain.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And it also,
actually, can really

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.150 align:middle line:84%
help you with all the flavonols,
and helping with your cravings,

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.915 align:middle line:90%
your immunity, and all of that.

00:31:18.915 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:90%
So those are what I--

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Establishing a great--

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:84%
you're approaching this with
this sense of wholeness,

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.358 align:middle line:90%
and how do I nurture myself.

00:31:28.358 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us some
examples of what

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:84%
you would use as
your affirmations

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.470 align:middle line:84%
to contribute to the big
mindset and the big come

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:84%
from that you're
creating for yourself

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.890 align:middle line:84%
in this nurturing
regime every day.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The affirmations
change all the time.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But some that I really love is,
I trust the process of life.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:90%
I trust myself.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I love myself.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So I say those
to-- that to water.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And every time I'm
drinking water, I say that.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe, and I know
we know from a scientific

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that it actually changes
the molecular structure

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.180 align:middle line:90%
of the water.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:84%
That as I'm made up of
70% of water, that's

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:90%
just going right inside of me.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's just helping my mojo.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:90%
So I love that.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But another affirmation, and
one that I really said a lot,

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and I imagine there's
others, because I've

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.140 align:middle line:84%
taken different affirmations
from different thought leaders,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
but I would do this when
I was broke as a joke,

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.830 align:middle line:84%
sleeping on the floor,
I would literally--

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I would go in nature
and say it really loud.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't do that now,
but I say it every day.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And I say this,
I'm increasing in

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.110 align:middle line:90%
success, abundance, and love.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm aspiring my children
and others to do the same.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's a mantra that
I do every single day.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And I tend to like to do it
when my body's in motion, when

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:50.030 align:middle line:84%
the cells are turning
and returning,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and the breaths
coming in and out.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I stand behind that saying,
because it really, I believe,

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.020 align:middle line:84%
has been this huge
anchor from where

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:90%
I was to where I am today.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You spoke about do
something that scares you.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.745 align:middle line:84%
You jumped into a
bikini competition.

00:33:06.745 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
come back to this,

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.953 align:middle line:84%
because we came back
to everything but that.

00:33:09.953 --> 00:33:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So what regime did you plug into
to take yourself from no man's

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:22.650 align:middle line:84%
land, what you call it, broke as
a joke, you're there, flat out.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And now you're starting
to climb up out of that.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, all right,
I'm going to take something on.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to spark
some life into my life.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, you
started to plug into something.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So what then did
you do that allowed

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:84%
you to be in a
bikini competition

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.565 align:middle line:84%
and have the
confidence to do that?

00:33:44.565 --> 00:33:45.815 align:middle line:90%
>> It started with a question.

00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm guessing it
worked out well for you.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It did.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I started with a
question, though.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was, what
really terrifies me?

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And not just terrifies
me because it

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:84%
feels scary, but terrifies me
on a deep, deep, deep level.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I like wrote down
like snowboarding,

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:90%
because I always liked skiing.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote down--

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember, some
of the other ones.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.679 align:middle line:84%
But then I was
like unpacking it.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is the work,
is like asking yourself

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:90%
these deep questions.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like I
just popped up and was

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:84%
like I'm going to do
a bikini competition.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I was really being
deliberate, intentional

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of what is something
that scares me.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
the bikini competition

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that I love now in
hindsight is that it was

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.820 align:middle line:90%
a form of my transformation.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times we
think transformation

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:32.090 align:middle line:84%
comes from sitting in caves
and meditating, and I'm like,

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:90%
oh, it can happen in a bikini.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like bring
this up to put these ideas

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.630 align:middle line:90%
around transformation.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But for me-- and granted, this
isn't going to be everyone

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
else's fear--

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
one, it wasn't so much about
being in a competition.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.800 align:middle line:90%
It was, I was in a bikini.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I grew up not ever
wearing a bikini

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
or exposing my body ever,
not at the pool, ever.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.210 align:middle line:90%
So that was a fear.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd never worn
high heels before,

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:84%
nor that idea of high heels
and my brain was that's sexy

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and that's not holy.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So I was like I'm going
to get in those high heels

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.120 align:middle line:90%
and do the unholy thing.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I got to break this
idea of what's holy in my brain.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And I can still be loved by a
creator, and wear high heels,

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.610 align:middle line:90%
and be sexy.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I had to break
that within myself

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:84%
to get to this deeper
sense of self-love.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.468 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't that I was like
in tune to all those thoughts,

00:35:23.468 --> 00:35:25.010 align:middle line:84%
but it was like,
oh, high heels, I've

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:84%
never walked in
high heels, I look

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.508 align:middle line:90%
like a giraffe in high heels.

00:35:27.508 --> 00:35:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Like, how am I going to do this?

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, the element of
bikini, high heels, competition,

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:90%
was like the perfect stewing--

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> The perfect storm.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> --of just deep, deep fear.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was terrifying.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I was
like, oh, if I register

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:84%
for like a local
show, I can just

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.665 align:middle line:84%
get out of a local show, because
I also have this money thing.

00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Like back then, I
had this money thing.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Like I was broke
as a joke, so I was

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:84%
like if I just put a couple
hundred dollars down,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I might be like, oh, I'm sick
today, I can't do this show.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Baby steps with
the back door open.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So I totally
registered for the World.

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So which I was like the
only one who hadn't done

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:90%
a competition at the World.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.680 align:middle line:90%
It was displayed on ESPN.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.910 align:middle line:90%
And it was in Toronto.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:90%
So I had to buy a plane ticket.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I had to pay this
price to do Worlds.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, just my
personality, that if I'm

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.650 align:middle line:84%
going to put down that chunk
of change, I'm showing up.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to do the work.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's where it really came
from, is what would scare me.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And I got so much
from that, because--

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.650 align:middle line:84%
not that I want
to do another one.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.660 align:middle line:90%
And I did place in the top 10.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading Wayne Dyer's
book, "The Power of Intention,"

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:40.940 align:middle line:90%
during my training.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So I visualized,
visualized, visualized,

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.880 align:middle line:84%
because I was the
girl who didn't

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:90%
know how to move her hips.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I was the girl who'd never
walked in her high heels,

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean such a tomboy.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And I really learned a lot.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.340 align:middle line:90%


00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So how did you
achieve the goal?

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:02.690 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to deprive
yourself of things?

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.755 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to change
radically in your preparation?

00:37:09.755 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, here you've
invested in this thing,

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:90%
you're going to go for it.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So now what did
you have to do?

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is why I also
love that I did this.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Because we often think that to
achieve this idea of sexiness

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.010 align:middle line:84%
or worthy of being
in a bikini that we

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.070 align:middle line:84%
have to deprive
ourselves of food,

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.850 align:middle line:84%
the very life force
that's there to heal us.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Or we have to abuse the
very life force of movement

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.500 align:middle line:90%
that's there to heal us.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And I did it in such a way
that was super healing.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is where all my
programs are based from now.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I was like, oh, my gosh,
I'm eating six times a day.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I was just choosing
really healing foods.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I got rid of everything
that was processed.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And really just chose the
healing things, the plants.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.260 align:middle line:90%
And I was eating six--

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm going
to eat six times a day.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to eat
when I'm hungry.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to deprive myself.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.020 align:middle line:10%
I removed refined sugar.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.032 align:middle line:84%
I removed anything in the
middle of a grocery store,

00:38:09.032 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:84%
that we would
typically buy, that's

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:84%
boxed, and has all
these other things

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:90%
added that do not serve us.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
that's how I always live,

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.510 align:middle line:84%
but at this time I
made that decision

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that this was the food
I was going to eat.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't depriving.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I was actually feeling way more
energy than I've ever felt.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I was waking up to myself,
because I was eating really

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.260 align:middle line:90%
healing foods.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I wish sometimes I would
be like that more diligently,

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:84%
because now I will splurge
on different white sugars

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.470 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But when I was doing that,
everything was coming alive.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It was like food was just
going into the cells.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.480 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't work out extreme.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I actually didn't.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I trained five days a
week, 30 to 45 minutes max.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did some weights,
I did some running,

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:90%
and that was that.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I really didn't
have to do anything too crazy

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and actually felt like
everything was waking up inside

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.190 align:middle line:90%
of me.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And not that it's
about a bikini competition

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:84%
for everyone, because some
people will have a very

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.900 align:middle line:84%
different goal, but
something will scare them.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And that decision
to go ahead with it

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to lead
them to a focus.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the universe
is going to show up to help

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.230 align:middle line:90%
support that.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.310 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of things
are going to shift.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:30.740 align:middle line:84%
What kind of women are
seeking training and guidance

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:90%
in your programs?

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Who is it that's showing up,
saying, hey, hey, hey, me too?

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Who is that?

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I actually
know who are avatar is.

00:39:39.753 --> 00:39:40.670 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
In our business, we got shut
down from Facebook twice.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was like
our lead generation.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And we now get invited
to their headquarters.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They team up with us on
all of our projects now.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were telling me, they
knew algorithms on our business

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.490 align:middle line:90%
that I just didn't even know.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And they said that we had
reached 190 million households

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.210 align:middle line:90%
in a nine month period.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.348 align:middle line:90%
And they were organic.

00:40:06.348 --> 00:40:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And they said we know
exactly who you're reaching

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:90%
and who's watching you.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was blown
away, and we were all

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.980 align:middle line:90%
blown away with these stats.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
what these men

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.570 align:middle line:84%
at this roundtable
at the headquarters

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:90%
were saying about these women.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And these were
women who had gone

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.570 align:middle line:84%
to high school, actually gotten
a lot of the perfect things--

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.850 align:middle line:84%
they're married, they got
the picket white fence,

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:33.890 align:middle line:84%
they live in a nice home,
they have some resources,

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.960 align:middle line:90%
and they want the truth.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And they'd tried
things in the past

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're ready
to be fed the truth.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
interesting that men

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.710 align:middle line:84%
in our roundtable at Facebook
would say, they want truth.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.870 align:middle line:84%
They feel that you have
a sense of authenticity

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that they're not getting
from other things.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.590 align:middle line:90%
They're quite educated.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.523 align:middle line:90%
And so these are the women.

00:40:56.523 --> 00:40:57.690 align:middle line:90%
They're just ready for more.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're typically
older than me, actually.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:84%
They're women that
anywhere-- and now we're

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.310 align:middle line:84%
hitting a younger
demographic now,

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:84%
because I think these
younger demographic are

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.485 align:middle line:90%
getting wiser and wiser.

00:41:07.485 --> 00:41:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, when I was
at the Facebook headquarters,

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:84%
they were like these are women
that are ready to do something

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.238 align:middle line:84%
with their lives, and they
have the resources to do it,

00:41:15.238 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're ready to
step into their truth.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So why were you shut
down from Facebook?

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.175 align:middle line:84%
>> So many-- we've been shut
down from Google and Facebook.

00:41:22.175 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of business.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So our first-- you have to be
really careful on Facebook,

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:28.820 align:middle line:90%
what you put on your header.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're a business,
or if you use anything

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.575 align:middle line:90%
around the word weight loss.

00:41:32.575 --> 00:41:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Promises and
things like that.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah so we got wise and hired
people that actually knew what

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.420 align:middle line:90%
were within the guidelines.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:38.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Never mind it's working.

00:41:38.795 --> 00:41:40.378 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed
to say it that way.

00:41:40.378 --> 00:41:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> We were just doing our thing.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so Facebook,
which I really respect,

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
is trying to not create any
sense of guilt for people that

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.830 align:middle line:84%
are on that platform
or things like that.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Perfect, and it's working.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think that
you have this stick

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.740 align:middle line:90%
rate that keeps people engaged?

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.610 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>> This is my belief, and I
don't actually have any stats

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.460 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.920 align:middle line:84%
We're a big company
around stats,

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.330 align:middle line:84%
but I believe because I add
this mind component to all

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.550 align:middle line:84%
of my programs,
and really trying

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to help women unravel this
subconscious belief that's

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:84%
around not being enough,
around this idea of who

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.650 align:middle line:84%
they think they are, to get
them back into their truth.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And every program comes
with this mind work.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that they
take a hold of that mind,

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.770 align:middle line:84%
like doing the three minute
meditation-- what I call it--

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:35.790 align:middle line:90%
just really simple--

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.330 align:middle line:84%
they can do it driving or
whatever-- is what's made

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:42.142 align:middle line:84%
them all stay and actually
see results long term.

00:42:42.142 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> You're also a coach.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.207 align:middle line:84%
And you speak about
the 17 second rule.

00:42:46.207 --> 00:42:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually,
it's interesting,

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.157 align:middle line:84%
because I was
teaching about this.

00:42:50.157 --> 00:42:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if anybody knows--

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.098 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Mel Rob-- she
has a five second rule.

00:42:54.098 --> 00:42:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've read her book.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I haven't read her book,
but she's a lovely lady.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And she talks about
being five seconds.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.693 align:middle line:84%
And I've been talking
about 17 seconds.

00:43:01.693 --> 00:43:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
always what I was

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.480 align:middle line:84%
noticing with myself
and my clients,

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.010 align:middle line:84%
is that we get a
hunch, we get a nudge,

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:09.650 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of inspiration.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe those internal goose
bumps or an idea pops up,

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't
act on it, or start

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:20.540 align:middle line:84%
setting into motion whatever
that thought was, and like

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.280 align:middle line:84%
reaching out to the
person, or going

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and doing XYZ to fulfill
on it, it will go away,

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
or you'll find a lot of
excuses not to do it.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have a very small
window, whether it's

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.532 align:middle line:90%
five seconds or 17 seconds--

00:43:32.532 --> 00:43:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>> That's still pretty
short, either way, yeah.

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> --to just get into motion.

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people are
like, you're so motivated.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Which motivated is
motion, right, in motion.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's like no one is
more motivated than others.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just those who appear
motivated get things in motion

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.770 align:middle line:90%
quicker, within that 17 seconds.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So can you act on that
hunch, your intuition,

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.800 align:middle line:84%
your hunch, within 17 seconds,
start getting things in motion.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.620 align:middle line:90%
And it starts to spiral.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.606 align:middle line:84%
And then it looks
like you're motivated.

00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:05.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's just
17 seconds at a time.

00:44:05.305 --> 00:44:06.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally.

00:44:06.105 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> In segments.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Fabulous.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Where can people
come to learn more?

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Where can they go to find you?

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:14.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think the main
website where we give out free

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.840 align:middle line:10%
information every single day
at DanetteMay.com would be

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.070 align:middle line:10%
the easiest way to find me.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, DanetteMay.com.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Fabulous.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Danette,
for joining us today.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Your journey is an
amazing inspiration.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And one that I know is
going to touch people,

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:34.910 align:middle line:84%
because of your beautiful,
down to earth approach that

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.080 align:middle line:84%
