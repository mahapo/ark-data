>>SUE MORTER: The man
sitting with us today

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:84%
has had the cure for
cancer for 40 years.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:10%
You may not know his name,
and the FDA certainly

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:10%
doesn't want you to.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:10%
He's been called a quack,
a fraud, and a criminal.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The government has tried to
take away his medical license

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and throw him in jail,
all because he has

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:90%
the key we've been looking for.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.943 align:middle line:84%
Welcome Dr. Burzynski
to "Healing Matrix."

00:00:46.943 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STANISLAW BURZYNSKI:
It's my pleasure.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:90%

>>RICK SCHIFF: My name
is Sergeant Rick Schiff.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm an 11-year veteran of
the San Francisco Police

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:10%
Department.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:10%
What I'd like to talk
to you about today

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:10%
is my now 7-year-old daughter.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:10%
This is an identical twin.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.163 align:middle line:10%
Her sister is now dead.

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:10%
Her sister, when she
was four years old,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:10%
Kristen, developed a highly
malignant brain tumor

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:10%
that had spread throughout
her spine and her brain.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:10%
The doctors told us that
we had really two options--

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:10%
take her home, let
her die or bring her

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.647 align:middle line:10%
in for massive dosages of chemo
and radiation simultaneously.

00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:10%
In either event, she
was going to die.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:10%
They were quite certain
of that and very quickly.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:10%
Believing her only chance
to be the standard route,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:10%
we gave her the
chemo and radiation.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:10%
It burned her skull so bad,
she had second-degree burns,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.665 align:middle line:10%
and her hair never came back.

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:10%
To change her diapers, we
had to wear rubber gloves

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:10%
because her urine was so
toxic, and it burned her.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.458 align:middle line:10%
At the end of six months,
miraculously she survived

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:10%
the standard treatment, although
there was a high expectation

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:10%
she wouldn't.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:10%
She still had cancer.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:10%
We were told, sorry, we've
done everything we can.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:10%
Now she's going to die, probably
within a couple of months.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:10%
My wife and I, choosing
not to accept that,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:10%
started reading a
first book I picked up,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:10%
the third chapter,
discussed Dr. Burzynski.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:10%
I have no doubt
that he does what

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:10%
he does out of earnest belief
that his medicine works.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:10%
But it's well-established by
the FDA that it's non-toxic.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.570 align:middle line:10%
We put her back on
Burzynski's-- by the way,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:10%
at the objections
of our doctors,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:10%
for some reason felt
that it had failed her--

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:10%
we put her back on.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:10%
Within nine weeks, the
tumor was completely gone.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:10%
She died last July of
neurological necrosis.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:10%
Her brain fell apart
from the radiation.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:10%
The autopsy showed that she
was completely cancer free.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:10%
Out of 52 cases of
that disease ever,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:10%
no one died cancer
free, just Krissy.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:10%
So she didn't die of
a terminal illness.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:10%
She died of my inability
to care for properly,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:10%
and she died from bad advice.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:10%
She died because there's a
government institution that

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:10%
disseminates false information
and is not looking out

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.038 align:middle line:10%
for welfare of the people

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:10%
>>JULIAN WHITAKER: I first
heard of Dr. Burzynski

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:10%
back in the late 1980s when he
was in a battle with the Texas

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:10%
Medical Board and
the FDA regarding

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:10%
his innovative
approach to cancer.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski had MRIs
of brain tumors known

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:10%
to be almost universally fatal,
and it simply disappeared.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:10%
It was obvious to me
that Dr. Burzynski

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:10%
had made the most important
discovery in cancer treatment

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:10%
ever.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>> While undergoing his
research to acquire his PhD, Dr.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski made a
profound discovery.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:10%
He found a strain of peptides
in human blood and urine

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:10%
that had never
before been recorded

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:10%
in biomedical research.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:10%
As his curiosity in
these peptides evolved,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:10%
he made another
profound observation--

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.600 align:middle line:10%
people who were
inflicted with cancer

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:10%
seemed to lack these
newly discovered peptides

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:10%
in both their blood
and urine, while those

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:10%
who were healthy
and free of cancer

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:10%
appeared to have an abundance.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: The worst type of
cancer can be cured for good.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The people who are surviving,
they live normal life.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:90%
No side effects of treatment.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
No symptoms, no signs
of tumors, back to life.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Since Dr. Burzynski began
treating cancer patients with

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:10%
antineoplastons, he has
successfully treated virtually

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:10%
every type of cancer, relieving
thousands of families from

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:10%
across the world of
this dread disease.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:10%
Yet, unlike other
clinical trials,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:10%
which are supported by
billion-dollar pharmaceutical

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:10%
companies and are often assisted
by large tax-funded research

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:10%
grants from the National
Cancer Institute,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:10%
the United States
government currently

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:10%
prohibits any taxpayer money to
be granted to Dr. Burzynski's

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.798 align:middle line:10%
FDA-approved clinical trials.

00:05:08.798 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITAKER: The
problem that we face,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
however, is that a
huge financial house

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
has been built on the
paradigm of purging

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:90%
the body of cancer cells.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski's discovery means
that the foundation, the walls,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and the roof of that
house need to be replaced.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've got
thousands of doctors

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.347 align:middle line:84%
in oncology and in oncology
residency programs.

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
pharmaceutical industry

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
pumping out chemotherapeutic
agents every month.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of machines
that deliver radiation.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:84%
You've got all this stuff
in the war on cancer.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's trillions of dollars.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Burzynski, his patients,
and other supporting scientists

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
have made every conceivable
effort to get the FDA and thus

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
the government to cooperate
in the research, review,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and approval of
antineoplastons since 1977.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:10%
In 1986, Dr. Burzynski agreed
to present to the Texas State

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Board of Medical
Examiners 40 cases

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:10%
of various types of
cancer he had successfully

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:10%
treated using
antineoplastons in patients

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:10%
ranging from breast, bladder,
lung, liver, brain, head

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.700 align:middle line:10%
and neck, and lymphoma.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
After submitting these
cases to the medical board,

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
he didn't hear back
from them, leaving

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
him to assume that the
board was satisfied

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%
and would leave him in peace.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:10%
However, two years
later, the board

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:10%
came back again, pretended
that the cases he submitted

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:10%
were not successful,
and claimed he

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:10%
was violating a law
that didn't exist,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:10%
which was grounds for the board
to cancel, revoke, or suspend

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:10%
his license.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:84%
After about five years of this,
60 of Dr. Burzynski's patients

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.640 align:middle line:84%
petitioned the board to
stop harassing their doctor.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
The board then tried to ignore
these petitions by attempting

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:90%
to strike them from the record.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Finally, in May of 1993,
this case went to trial.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You intend to continue doing
just what you've been doing

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
until somebody is able to
stop you, is that not true?

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I'm going
to do what the law will

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:90%
allow me to do, Mr. Helmcamp.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I do whatever is necessary to
bring my medicines to approval

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
in the United States and
everywhere in the world

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and bring you to
justice for causing

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:90%
the deaths of 200 patients.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>>EARL CORBITT: I never
was quite clear what

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:10%
the board's problem was.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:10%
The board did not bring
any expert witnesses

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:10%
to contest points that were
raised by Dr. Burzynski.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:49.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:10%
>> They had a raid of his
clinic where they seized 200,000

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:10%
pieces of paper, including
all of his medical records.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: It took us
about 12 years or 14 years

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
to recover these
medical records.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:10%
The smear campaign against us
continues from good doctors,

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:10%
from the American
Medical Association,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:10%
from American Cancer Society,
despite the fact that it

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:10%
should shop a long time ago.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So how is it?

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Are you still
fighting with the FDA?

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, no.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:10%
At this moment, we are
enjoying working relationship

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:10%
with the FDA.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:10%
We are exchanging
correspondence.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:10%
Basically, I think we
are now talking mostly

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.997 align:middle line:10%
with the computers with FDA.

00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:90%
But we are moving forward.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:90%
So we are not fighting.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So have any
of your drugs been

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:84%
approved by the FDA for
distribution and treatment?

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:90%
One of them has been approved.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a prescription medication.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.097 align:middle line:84%
And we are now working
to increase indication

00:08:54.097 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:90%
for this medication.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Means to spread to a
larger number of cancer.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:84%
We are working on
two other medications

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
in final approval steps, which
is phase III clinical trials.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So experts are telling
us that there is a quantum shift

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:90%
happening with cancer therapy.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you say more about
what is happening now?

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Absolutely.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the current
approach to cancer

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
was introduced a long time
ago, about 170 years ago,

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:84%
by a great doctor, whose
name was Rudolf Virchow,

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and he introduced
diagnosis of cancer

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:90%
by looking under a microscope.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And since then, the
doctors were asking,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
well, let's have
pathology examination look

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
under a microscope and
put the label on cancer.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the breast cancer,
this is a lung cancer,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
this is cancer of
the ovary, et cetera.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
did it, the government

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
gave them instructions,
treat everybody the same way.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Because everybody's the same.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the
American idea, it was

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I think Joseph Stalin's idea
that everybody's the same.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But in America, somehow
they embraced it,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
they introduce
instructions to doctors,

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:84%
treat everybody who has the same
name of cancer the same way,

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:84%
without looking
into differences.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So basically, once they put
the label, they treat this way.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:84%
But now we realize
that the cancer

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.680 align:middle line:90%
is caused by abnormal genes.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
There are a large
number of abnormal genes

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:84%
in individual cancer, from
about 40 to 650 abnormal genes.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't identify
what is causing cancer,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and genes are causing
cancer, you're

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:90%
not going to get rid of this.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:90%
So suddenly, there is a shift.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Last year, FDA approved
two medications

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.870 align:middle line:84%
to treat any type of cancer
across the board in which there

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:90%
is a mutation of a single gene.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
That's going away from
treating the label,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
well, breast cancer,
lung cancer, whatever.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:84%
They said treat any
cancer possible in which

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
you find mutation
of single gene,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
because this medication
works on this gene,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and it works at
about 90% certainty.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big shift.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Very few doctors
noted this, but that's

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of the end
of the previous approach.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the future, we
hope that the doctors

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330 align:middle line:84%
will be treating genes
which are causing cancer

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
name of the cancer.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And when they do it, they'll
be able to cure cancer.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was trying
to do for many, many years.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I introduced this
into cancer treatment in 1976.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to cure
the first patient in 1977.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
But since then,
we are developing,

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and our approach is to find
which genes are causing cancer,

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:84%
treat these genes,
get rid of the tumors,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and get rid of abnormal genes
which are causing cancer.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Then, the person can be cured.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.795 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this is an entire
shift in the entire approach

00:11:57.795 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:90%
to the treatment of cancer.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Rather than treating
the effects,

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
we are trying to move back
toward an earlier domino that

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.985 align:middle line:84%
fell and treat the cause, with
much of a less toxifying effect

00:12:09.985 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: That's
a big change.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.435 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: It's
the last things

00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:16.990 align:middle line:84%
similar change happen is then
when the antibiotics were

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:90%
introduced.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:90%
It took a long time.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Fleming reported the
discovery of penicillin,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
then for 10 years very few
people paid attention to it.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Finally, you got a war, and
then you did antibiotics

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:90%
to treat the wounds.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But then they began to treat,
well, infection of the wound,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
pneumonia, infection of
the bladder, whatever.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the good doctor
realized, no, infections

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
are not caused by bad
spirits, by odors,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:90%
they're caused by germs.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's identify the germs.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.847 align:middle line:90%
Let's treat the germs.

00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
It took them a while
to understand it.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Finally, when they
got it, and they

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.770 align:middle line:84%
got a good success, great
success, to treat infection,

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:90%
because they treated the germs.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:84%
They did Staphylococcus,
E coli, whatever,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:90%
with proper antibiotics.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, similarly to
getting cancer is

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
something, the
name of the cancer,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:84%
that beginning to
treat the genes.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
We are still far
away from this, OK?

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:84%
We are doing this
for many years.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
We are doing this in
our daily practice,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
but it requires very
complex approach.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:90%
But it can be very useful.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.035 align:middle line:84%
We can get rid of
cancer ultimately.

00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:25.835 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, cancer is a much
more serious condition

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:84%
than the average infection
that we deal with.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And you are definitely
approaching and addressing

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:84%
this from this most
amazing perspective.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: This is very,
very complex problem,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:84%
because in the
complex infection,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
you may have a combination
of three, two germs,

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and you use a combination
of two to three antibiotics.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:84%
In cancer, you have from
40 to 650 abnormal genes.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So you need to find the right
combination of the medication,

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:90%
which covers these genes.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Our medications,
which I discovered,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:84%
they cover 100 most important
genes in any cancer.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:90%
But this may not be enough.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
You may need to add some
other medications to cover

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
the genes which are not
covered by other medications.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So is curative treatment
possible for these terminal

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:84%
cancer patients when
it is this serious?

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it able to be turned around?

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Absolutely.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
see in our practice.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:90%
We see great people.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:10%
They have perfect credential.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
They graduated from the
best medical facilities

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.870 align:middle line:84%
in the world, and they
were told go home, stay

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and wait because you may
have one month of life left.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
They're coming to us
from all over the world,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:90%
and they would like to fight.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:90%
So we identify the genes.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:84%
We put together the program
which will treat these genes.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that the
tumors are melting away, even

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:90%
after one or two months.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
end of the story.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.150 align:middle line:84%
We would like to get
rid of the tumors,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.528 align:middle line:84%
and then we would like to
get rid of mutated genes.

00:15:00.528 --> 00:15:01.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's the next step.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And it can be done.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Once this is done, well,
let's live happily ever after.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
We have patients who are
surviving over 30 years

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and who came to us with
terminal cancer initially.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: 30 years.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.145 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Over 30 years.

00:15:15.145 --> 00:15:17.282 align:middle line:90%
35 I think is a record, but--

00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's impressive.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: That's
incredibly impressive.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: It's
not just one year,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and you claim, oh,
we cure this cancer.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It's many, many years when
they live cancer free,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and they live a
normal life, and they

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
don't have any problem
from adverse reactions

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
of their medications or
bad effects of cancer.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.093 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I call cure.

00:15:37.093 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They are cured.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Get rid of
cancer, get rid of bad genes,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:90%
live happily ever after, OK?

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Live a normal life.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.352 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how do we
define cure and remission?

00:15:46.352 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share
that for our audience.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Sure.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, statistically
and ideologically,

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
remission is defined as
decrease and disappearance

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:90%
of the tumors.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And if the tumor is
decreased by more than 50%,

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
it is defined as
partial remission.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:84%
When they are gone, by
the radiological methods,

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:90%
you say complete remission.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But radiological methods,
they are not perfect.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They can miss the
nodules, which contain

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:84%
malignant cells, which are
less than 0.2 centimeter

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And this means they
can miss something

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:84%
like perhaps 100 million
malignant cells which are still

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first step.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Then you come to find
out you can get rid

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
of the genes which are
causing the problem.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, we have
now great technology,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.390 align:middle line:90%
which can tell us about it.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:90%
We have laboratory tests.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.718 align:middle line:84%
We have blood tests, which are
approved by the government,

00:16:40.718 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:90%
which are covered by insurance.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Usually patients, they need
to pay anything for it.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
You can have the
answer in one week.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
What are the most important
cancer genes in your blood,

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:90%
at a great sensitivity.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And the sensitivity which
is 100 million times higher

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:90%
than radiological methods.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So first, you get
rid of the tumors,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:84%
then you get rid
of abnormal genes.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
Once you do it, well,
hopefully it won't come back.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But still, you may
repeat a laboratory test

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:84%
to find out if these genes
are coming back or not.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
If they come back, you
can get rid of them

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:84%
again before they
produce tumors.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
rid of the program

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:84%
in the body which is instructing
the body how to make cancer.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:90%
This is a cyber war, OK?

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:90%
It's an informational war.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of the software
in the body, which

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is providing instructions
how to make cancer.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Once you do it, you're done.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And the clue to
success is, if you

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:84%
have the genes
which can be treated

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
very current medication, if
you do, it can be accomplished.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you have to wait
until a new medication will

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:84%
be introduced, which can
treat these abnormal genes.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So first, you're
stopping the runaway train,

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going back and
taking a look at how it got out

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:90%
of control to begin with.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Absolutely.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, unfortunately,
we see some patients

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.860 align:middle line:90%
who are in terrible condition.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.807 align:middle line:84%
They've been brought to
us in coma, whatever.

00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So we are fighting for their
life at the very beginning.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
We need to stabilize them,
and they may not survive,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:90%
because they're so terrible.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But usually, in a
couple of weeks,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
we got rid of this
emergency situation.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, the first thing
we need to find out,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:90%
can we decrease the tumors?

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we are dealing
with malignant tumors,

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
the answer may come in
one month or two months.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
We repeat the scans and
find, OK, the tumors

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
have decreased a great
deal or they're gone.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So then, you try to
get rid of the genes.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It may take another three
months, and it may happen.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
If these are hereditary
abnormal genes, which

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
happens in small number
of cancer patients,

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:84%
then we may not be able
to get rid of them,

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:84%
unless there's only one copy
of the gene, which is abnormal.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.678 align:middle line:84%
In such situations,
it's possible.

00:18:51.678 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But this is minority
of the patients.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
In most of the patients,
the abnormal genes

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.860 align:middle line:84%
occurred during patient life
and the influence of viruses,

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:90%
chemicals, variety of factors.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:90%
And they can be eliminated.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's phenomenal.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Burzynski, let's talk
about the development

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of your approach that
you offer your patients

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:90%
when they come to your clinic.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the
patient comes to us,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.715 align:middle line:84%
we would like to know what
we are facing, what kind

00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:19.840 align:middle line:90%
of situation we are facing.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So we need to know how
many tumors do we have?

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Where are the tumors?

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.842 align:middle line:84%
We need to know the history
of previous treatments.

00:19:25.842 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
We need to do it quickly,
because these patients have

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:90%
a very short lifespan.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Then, we need to run the
studies for the genes.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We order the blood tests, which
is done by a different company.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And in about a week,
we have the results,

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
which shows, OK, in this patient
we have something like 10,

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:90%
maybe 20 mutated genes.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We know what kind of genes you
have, what kind of mutation.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
We know what is
the concentration

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
of these genes in billion part
of gram per cubic cc of blood.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we put together
the treatment plan.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.480 align:middle line:90%
We implement it.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.060 align:middle line:84%
We look for improvement
in patient condition.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:84%
If we see that a patient shortly
is improving clinically, then

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:84%
after the first month,
we repeat the scan.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
This is MRI for
the brain tumors,

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and we see what happened
to this patient.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:84%
In some patients, we see
that active tumor is gone.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
end of the story.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
In some others, we see,
no, it's not working.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
We need to change
our treatment plan,

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:84%
use different combination
of medications.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Try it again for another month
and hopefully is going to work.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the
patient is going home.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
He's taken treatment
at home under the care

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of local oncologist, and they
don't need to come to us.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Everything goes well.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Just when we finish the
treatment, and that's about it.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is considered
the golden standard

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
for the diagnosis and
treatment of cancer?

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: The golden standard
is pathology diagnosis, which

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:90%
is nothing wrong is this.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
It just identify what
kind of cancer it is.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:84%
This is breast cancer,
this is adenocarcinoma,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:90%
or squamous cell carcinoma.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
There are different
types of cancer,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and that's the first step.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But after that, you
need to understand

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
that under the
single name, there

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
may be 100,000 different
varieties because

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:90%
of different genes.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So then we need to find
out what is causing this.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
If you are serious about
getting rid of this,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:84%
we need to find out
what is causing this.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I am talking about
advanced cases.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
If these are easy cases,
when the tumor can

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:84%
be easily removed, and the
patient is cured, that's fine.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking about when
the cancer has spread.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
In such cases, usually cannot
be cured by standard treatment,

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
unless we find what is causing
this and we hit the cause

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:90%
of the problem.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And how old is this
golden standard approach?

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.795 align:middle line:84%
How long has that
been in existence?

00:21:48.795 --> 00:21:51.352 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: It got
introduced is an 1845.

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It might be
outdated a little bit.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We might have
progressed beyond.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.333 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Obviously, it
was perfected, because we got

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:90%
better microscope, et cetera.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
But 1845 was the date
when this was introduced.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, three years
before Charles Marx

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:84%
presented his
theory, which really

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:90%
turned the world upside down.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Dr. Burzynski synthesizes
these antineoplastons in his

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.140 align:middle line:84%
state-of-the-art laboratory
in Houston, Texas.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at his lab.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Burzynski's manufacturing
facility in Stafford, Texas,

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
where his antineoplastons
are now synthesized,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
is a multi-million dollar
46,000 square foot facility,

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:84%
which staffs five
engineers, four chemists,

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
three pharmacists, four medical
doctors, and four researchers.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mighty impressive.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is all you.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.756 align:middle line:84%
This is you privately
funding this, making

00:22:46.756 --> 00:22:47.923 align:middle line:90%
this happen in this fashion.

00:22:47.923 --> 00:22:48.723 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:22:48.723 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order to be serious
about approval of medication,

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
you need to meet very
difficult standard of the FDA.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Which
means everything

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
should be manufactured according
to current good manufacturing

00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.125 align:middle line:84%
It means you need
to build factory.

00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:00.925 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:23:00.925 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: And I decided
to build a factory.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.557 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, you did.

00:23:04.557 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: We build a factory.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:84%
FDA approved this for making
medication for clinical trials.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:84%
We are doing this for
a number of years.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Then, recently they came again.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Then they told us, well,
make it more beautiful.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.085 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: So we did, OK?

00:23:20.085 --> 00:23:21.785 align:middle line:84%
So we are about
finishing this project.

00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:22.702 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: That's amazing.

00:23:22.702 --> 00:23:25.853 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: It's cost us good
amount of money, but making

00:23:25.853 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:90%
things more beautiful.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: But here you are.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.003 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: And hopefully we
move forward with the approval.

00:23:30.003 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: That's amazing.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
You have been in
full steam ahead

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:84%
with your whole life devoted
to this project, obviously.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Except
that, of course,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
we are living like
in say West Bank

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:84%
or in Gaza Strip, where
we have consistently

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:90%
bombs falling in the war.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Work, it's not so easy,
because for the last 35 years,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
we have continuously
been attacked

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.478 align:middle line:90%
and fighting for survival.

00:23:52.478 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: On one form
or another, right?

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.177 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: That's right.

00:23:54.177 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Constantly being
attacked and surviving.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what we have to
do for paradigm shifts, right?

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: That's right.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: This is it.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.923 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I know that
that's what is going to happen,

00:24:02.923 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
because I read the theories
of "Scientific Revolutions."

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:84%
My father gave me the book
about it of Thomas Kuhn,

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:84%
professor of MIT,
when I was just 22.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:90%
So I knew what was in store.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:90%
So I was expecting this.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I knew that in
order to win, I will

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.790 align:middle line:84%
face very long period of time
of harassment, persecution,

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and in order to survive,
I need to live long enough

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:90%
to survive my critics.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Because they would never agree.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I also involved
in their research on aging,

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.632 align:middle line:84%
to slow down the aging process
so I can live long enough--

00:24:39.632 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Long enough to
carry this through.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: That's right.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.548 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: To see it to fruition.

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Research on aging,
research on brain, on memory,

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, because we
need to have a good memory

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and to have good brain
to be able to do it.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Amazing.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: So hopefully, these
things are coming together.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Cancer research, cancer on
aging, and cancer of memory,

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.305 align:middle line:84%
and some out-shoot of this
like Alzheimer, et cetera.

00:25:02.305 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So over the years, we went
into these various directions.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But cancer research project
was given the priority,

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:90%
because it's so important.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You are a true pioneer.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I was raised by a pioneer
in energy medicine.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I understand this-- what it
takes to have this happen,

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and I have such a regard
for what you're doing.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:20.865 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank
you very much.

00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:22.282 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I want to
know how long did

00:25:22.282 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
it take you to start
with this theory

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and put it together and
then bring it to a place

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:84%
where you could try to
present it to your peers.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.560 align:middle line:90%
How did they respond?

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.470 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
initially, it took something

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:90%
like seven years.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I came to US in 1970, and just
the day before my birthday

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:84%
anniversary, President Nixon
announced a war on cancer.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well, what the heck.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I try, OK.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So I sent application to
NIH, and I got funded.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So I became principal
investigator on the project

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.920 align:middle line:90%
from National Cancer Institute.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I was supervising the guys
who could be my father.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I was 27 years old.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was supervising
some top specialists.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't from MD
Anderson Cancer Center,

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:90%
from Baylor College of Medicine.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But for seven years, I was
conducting first-class research

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
at Baylor College of Medicine,
funded from the War On Cancer.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And I presented
the results in 1976

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to the gathering of something
like 19,000 top scientists

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.660 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:84%
They decided this
was a great thing.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I was
congratulated by everybody,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:84%
which is typical for the history
of scientific revolutions.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So it took some like
six years to present it.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The grant which I
received was $55,000.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not $6 billion, which
President Nixon gave on cancer.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to prove
that because of this money,

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.960 align:middle line:84%
we cured the first
patient a year later.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So the money which
President Nixon spent

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:84%
was not spent in vain,
at least in our case,

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:84%
because you're able to
cure the first cancer

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:84%
patient from this money, from
$55,000 of this $6 billion,

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:84%
which was given
for this purpose.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
happened at that time.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Was congratulated, offered
more money, bigger grant.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the thieves
occurred, the guys who

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.485 align:middle line:90%
are trying to steal it from us.

00:27:26.485 --> 00:27:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was the beginning
of the next period

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:90%
of time, the beginning of war.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And the beginning--
the reason for the war

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:84%
was to steal it
from us, to make it

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:84%
beneficial for the
pharmaceutical companies

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and for some guys
from the government.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.760 align:middle line:90%
They knew what they were doing.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.105 align:middle line:84%
They will make an agreement with
pharmaceutical guys, the guys

00:27:45.105 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:84%
from the government,
the pharmaceutical guys.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So if ever there was
conspiracy in cancer war,

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.765 align:middle line:84%
it is the conspiracy where
the government cooperated

00:27:52.765 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:84%
with pharmaceutical companies
to put us out of business

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and to put me to
prison for 270 years

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:84%
so they can steal our discovery,
and they can profit from it.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It didn't work, because the
American people helped me.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I never spent even
day in prison,

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and I was able to move forward.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And not only
that, it didn't work,

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and you've saved thousands
and thousands of lives

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:90%
in the meantime since then.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: We
saved many lives.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:10%
Of course, many people
came to us too late,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:10%
and we couldn't do much.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:10%
But many of them
recovered completely,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:10%
and they live a normal life.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.290 align:middle line:84%
First time in the
medical history

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:84%
having a diagnosis with
that type of cancer.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: First time.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: The FDA
knew about it very well.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:90%
They realized the value of this.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we are so
fiercely attacked at that time.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.647 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: It
was some time ago.

00:28:41.647 --> 00:28:42.520 align:middle line:90%
It was not today.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.660 align:middle line:90%
And people have changed at FDA.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The guys who attacked us now,
they occupied very nice places

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
in the large
pharmaceutical companies.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So they live happy life with
a lot of gold in the pocket.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But previously, they're
very anxious to put us out

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:90%
of business.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.022 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We are eternally
grateful for your efforts there.

00:29:01.022 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:84%
You've brought some
scans with you.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.463 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:29:03.463 --> 00:29:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Let's take a
look at those scans.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Sure.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Will you walk us
through some of the results?

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: I'd be glad to.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, now these are the
most recent results,

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:10%
and for instance, this scan
shows MRI, baseline MRI,

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:10%
which is on the left, of the
patient who was diagnosed

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:10%
with glioblastoma.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.940 align:middle line:10%
A 51-year-old lady
who underwent surgery,

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:10%
radiation, chemotherapy.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.660 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, the
tumors came back.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.650 align:middle line:10%
You see active tumor, which
is shown as a white big spot.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:34.310 align:middle line:10%
And also you see the rest of
this, which is surrounding,

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:10%
which is dark area,
which consists mostly

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.430 align:middle line:10%
of inflammation.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:10%
So after about four
weeks of treatment,

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.050 align:middle line:10%
you don't see this
white fragment anymore,

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:10%
which means that
active tumor is gone.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: In a month.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.432 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: In
approximate a month.

00:29:49.432 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that the patient
is cured, because we still

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.110 align:middle line:10%
have some microscopic.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Certainly.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: She is still
taking the treatment.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.967 align:middle line:90%
I saw her yesterday.

00:29:55.967 --> 00:29:57.800 align:middle line:84%
This is after the second
month of treatment,

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:90%
she's doing great.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:90%
So not sign of tumor.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:10%
Then, this is another
patient who also--

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:10%
who came to us from Korea.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.460 align:middle line:10%
She also had surgery,
radiation, chemotherapy.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:10%
She also had
experimental treatment.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.050 align:middle line:10%
The tumor came back, and
you see this white big spot,

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:14.360 align:middle line:10%
which is occupying
something like a quarter

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:10%
of the brain, which is a
recurrent glioblastoma.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:10%
A deadly disease,
something like a couple

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:10%
of month life expectancy.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:10%
After four weeks of
treatment, it's gone.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.032 align:middle line:10%
You don't see any of this
and continues to be gone.

00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:27.740 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: So with the
traditional therapies,

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:10%
with chemo and radiation,
and then a tumor returns--

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.125 align:middle line:10%
>>BURZYNSKI: There's
nothing available.

00:30:32.125 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --what time
frame does it return?

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well--

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.203 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Over what
kind of a time frame?

00:30:36.203 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Would we expect it to return in
this same kind of time frame?

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:10%
Usually, it's coming back within
something like nine months.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: OK.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: After all
of these treatments.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes after four months.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Maximum something
like 14 months.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:10%
And then it comes back.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:10%
Something like 80%
of these people

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.517 align:middle line:10%
are dead within six months.

00:30:54.517 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Nothing really is available
as standard treatment.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.435 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: But you're seeing 6
months, 8 months, 10 years,

00:30:59.435 --> 00:31:00.235 align:middle line:90%
12 years.

00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:00.860 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: 19 years.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:03.690 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Living a normal life.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.460 align:middle line:10%
And now, since we have all
of these other medications

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:10%
available, now we
can do much more,

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.467 align:middle line:10%
because we can cover a
bigger number of genes

00:31:12.467 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:10%
and give much faster result. And
this is outpatient treatment.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.675 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Show us what
else you have here.

00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:10%
>>BURZYNSKI: So
this is PET/CT scan

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:10%
of a patient who developed
very aggressive form of colon

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:10%
cancer, which
spread to the liver.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.560 align:middle line:10%
You see white spots,
which are liver tumors.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:84%
She went to the best
place in the country.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They gave her something like
three months of life left.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And she came to us.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
We got rid of all of her
tumors after about something

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.880 align:middle line:90%
like six months or so.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:84%
She is now two years
since we treated her.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.560 align:middle line:90%
She is in perfect condition.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.110 align:middle line:90%
She does not have any tumors.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.140 align:middle line:10%
And this is metastatic
colon cancer

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.505 align:middle line:10%
for which really there was
very little what can be done.

00:31:48.505 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty bad
involvement of the liver.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Terrible
prognosis with that.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:10%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, this is a
young lady with ovarian cancer.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.987 align:middle line:10%
You can see also PET/CT scan.

00:31:57.987 --> 00:32:00.320 align:middle line:10%
To the left, you can see all
of these white spots, which

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:10%
are tumors, which have spread
in the abdominal cavity, also

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.730 align:middle line:10%
in the liver.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:08.540 align:middle line:10%
And then after nine months,
practically everything is gone.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:90%
And she's alive and doing well.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.425 align:middle line:84%
And that was about
also coming something

00:32:12.425 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:90%
like two years since then.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:10%
And this lady came to us
with malignant lymphoma

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:10%
and leukemia.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:10%
And to the left,
you can see PET scan

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.800 align:middle line:10%
image shows the
dark spots, which

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:10%
are large tumors in the
upper part of the body,

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:10%
in the lower part of the body.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:31.190 align:middle line:10%
After about four
months of treatment,

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:10%
everything cleared up.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:10%
You don't see any of this.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:10%
It's not yet cured.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just remission.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
continue the treatment

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:84%
for some time to make sure
that we solidify everything.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.453 align:middle line:84%
We get rid of abnormal genes,
and the patient's fine.

00:32:44.453 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:90%
The patient is colon cancer.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:84%
She does not have any abnormal
genes in the system anymore.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.900 align:middle line:90%
So she's quite protected.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's
absolutely phenomenal.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:90%
It's phenomenal.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: And
this can be done.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the technology
that's available.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And it can be done.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.780 align:middle line:90%
It's been happening.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.755 align:middle line:84%
The patient does not need
to be in the hospital.

00:33:00.755 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: This isn't a theory.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: This is outpatient.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, the
patient taking treatment

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.440 align:middle line:90%
at home.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.090 align:middle line:90%
So it's easy thing.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:84%
It can save trillion
dollar a year

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.538 align:middle line:84%
from medical care costs
in the United States,

00:33:13.538 --> 00:33:15.080 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
need hospital beds.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't need all of these
sophisticated things, which

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.040 align:middle line:84%
are done at the hospital, and
the patient is dying anyway.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:90%
How does this feel for you?

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I am
frustrated, because I am

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:90%
doing this for so many years.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And I am trying to change
beef-eaters to angels

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and trying to change beef-eating
good oncologists to angels

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult. But
now I can see someone

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:84%
like maybe two
conversions per month.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.425 align:middle line:90%
So it's happening.

00:33:43.425 --> 00:33:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The mass consciousness
will catch onto this.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: That's right.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.430 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:47.815 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: People are
going to be requesting.

00:33:47.815 --> 00:33:48.898 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: That's right.

00:33:48.898 --> 00:33:51.190 align:middle line:84%
They are afraid to
do anything which

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:90%
can really help these people.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:84%
They're so entrenched with the
standard, which really is not

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.350 align:middle line:84%
helping much, because the
standard is already too old.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:84%
It was good 50 years
ago, not anymore.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Everything is changing.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is now probably
most of these doctors

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
will be replaced by artificial
intelligence in the years

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.179 align:middle line:84%
to come, because
they don't do much.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.570 align:middle line:84%
They simply follow the
orders from Washington.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So for that purpose,
you may need

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.480 align:middle line:84%
to have simply very
good computers,

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.221 align:middle line:84%
and they will do
even better job.

00:34:23.221 --> 00:34:24.679 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Some of your
patients wanted

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:84%
to share their gratitude for you
regarding your work with them.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.346 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank
you very much.

00:34:31.346 --> 00:34:32.929 align:middle line:84%
>>JODI FENTON: My
name is Jodi Fenton.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Burzynski saved
my life 19 years ago

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:84%
when I was diagnosed with an
inoperable brain tumor known

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.429 align:middle line:90%
as an anaplastic astrocytoma.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:43.790 align:middle line:84%
My name is Dustin Canary, and
Dr. Burzynski saved my life.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:47.540 align:middle line:10%
>> My wife was treated by
Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:84%
An incredible human
being, who I believe

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:84%
has found something that
could help so many people.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Hannah's prognosis
was like 18 months.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was eight years ago.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.740 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was 2
and 1/2 years old,

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.820 align:middle line:10%
I was diagnosed with a stage
IV medulloblastoma brain tumor.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FENTON: Conventional
doctors offered me

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:84%
chemotherapy and radiation,
said that maybe those treatments

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
would give me five years
to live, perhaps, maybe.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:10%
>> 75% of the tumor
was surgically removed,

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:10%
and the remaining 25%
was treated by Dr.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Burzynski's antineoplastons.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I got my scan results,
and like there's nothing,

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.172 align:middle line:84%
not even a teeny
tiny little bit left.

00:35:30.172 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:10%
>> The remaining tumor was
gone, and I've been in remission

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:10%
for over 20 years.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FENTON: Within six months,
all that was left of the tumor

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:90%
was scar tissue.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been cancer free
for like five years.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I ask you why
you're looking up there.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just thinking.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.527 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my thinking face.

00:35:46.527 --> 00:35:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Look, it is amazing.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.635 align:middle line:84%
And we never forget all of
the people that helped us.

00:35:50.635 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm doing my dream job,
working as a firefighter

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:84%
paramedic, and my wife
is expecting this fall.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FENTON: It's now
19 years later.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm cancer free.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm a thriving mother of two.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Burzynski saved my life,
and I owe my life to him.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Dr. Burzynski.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Without Dr. Burzynski, none
of this would be possible.

00:36:08.128 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:10%
And I owe my life to him.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe this guy needs
all of the adulation possible

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and for people to wake
up and realize who he is,

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.140 align:middle line:84%
what he's done, what he's doing,
and how his treatment could

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:90%
help so many people.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we look younger
than we did, better, brighter.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I look
a lot healthier.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think on that note, must
be the coffee that you drink.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Say goodbye.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Bye.

00:36:36.424 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Dr. Burzynski, there's
someone else who would also

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:90%
like to say hello to you.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank
you very much.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Hello, Jodi.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Are you there?

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.290 align:middle line:10%
>>FENTON: I am here.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:51.250 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Can you hear us?

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.614 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Hi, Dr. B.

00:36:53.614 --> 00:36:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: What
a surprise it is.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: How amazing.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.073 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Good to see you.

00:36:57.073 --> 00:36:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Good
to see you today.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: You look so well.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Thank you.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: I'm so glad.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Jodi so wanted to share
her appreciation with you

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.258 align:middle line:10%
once she knew that
we were doing this.

00:37:08.258 --> 00:37:09.550 align:middle line:90%
And she wanted to surprise you.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.620 align:middle line:90%
So what an amazing thing.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Jodi, can you just tell us a
little bit about your world

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:84%
now, your life, how you're
living, what's happening,

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
what Dr. Burzynski has had
as a role in your life.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Just share with us.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Sure.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the bottom
line is I am living.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.460 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: You know, I'm living.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. B saved my
life 19 years ago.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I was given 6 to 18 months to
live and did Dr. B's treatment,

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:42.550 align:middle line:90%
and within months, I was cured.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:48.130 align:middle line:10%
So again, 19 years later, I am
now a thriving mother of two

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:54.530 align:middle line:10%
and just living life, which
is what I intended to do.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.640 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: What an
amazing, amazing thing.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:10%
It's really miraculous,
relative to how

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.630 align:middle line:10%
we used to think
cancer had to turn out.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It certainly seems like a new
day in the world of cancer.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Yeah.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you're a
walking testament to that.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Absolutely.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.115 align:middle line:10%
>>BURZYNSKI: That is
what is important,

00:38:11.115 --> 00:38:14.530 align:middle line:10%
because it's not just
a year two years, which

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.980 align:middle line:10%
is the life expectancy of
this type of malignant tumor.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.833 align:middle line:10%
It just completely normal life.

00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And this
is how many years?

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: 15 or 18 years.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Yeah, 19.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Next months will be 19 years.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.000 align:middle line:10%
>>FENTON: So pretty amazing.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.800 align:middle line:10%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.748 align:middle line:10%
And her tumor went into
remission very rapidly, just

00:38:32.748 --> 00:38:35.290 align:middle line:10%
within something like a couple
of months, if I remember well.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It responded right away.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Your life turned around,
and all of a sudden,

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.050 align:middle line:84%
you're just living,
raising a family.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:10%
>>BURZYNSKI: And she's
in such a good condition,

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:46.120 align:middle line:10%
because she did
not have radiation,

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:10%
and she did not
have chemotherapy.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:10%
>>FENTON: Right.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.085 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: You never had
radiation or chemotherapy.

00:38:50.085 --> 00:38:50.885 align:middle line:10%
>>FENTON: No.

00:38:50.885 --> 00:38:53.140 align:middle line:90%
I had no other treatment.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:84%
After I was diagnosed,
I did some consults

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:84%
with oncologists
and neurosurgeons

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.490 align:middle line:84%
here locally in LA
and in San Francisco,

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and did not like what
they were saying.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:84%
They're like maybe we can
get you an additional five

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.760 align:middle line:90%
years of life or so.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And that just did
not sit well with me.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And I had heard
about Dr. Burzynski

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.310 align:middle line:84%
from a friend, read the book,
"The Burzynski Breakthrough."

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Burzynski's treatment
made sense to me.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Houston
and immediately went

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.510 align:middle line:90%
on Dr. Burzynski's treatment.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:10%
And within two months, the most
aggressive portion of the tumor

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:10%
was gone.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.930 align:middle line:10%
And within six months, all
that was left was scar tissue.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.818 align:middle line:10%
So yes, no other treatment.

00:39:34.818 --> 00:39:36.860 align:middle line:10%
The only treatment I ever
had was Dr. Burzynski's

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.230 align:middle line:10%
antineoplaston treatment.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So I could say with 1,000%
confidence, Dr. Burzynski,

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:90%
you saved my life.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:90%
You cured me.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.595 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank
you very much.

00:39:46.595 --> 00:39:49.408 align:middle line:10%
It's a great pleasure to
see you in good shape.

00:39:49.408 --> 00:39:50.700 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Brings tears to my eyes.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:10%
This is an amazing,
amazing moment.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.660 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: You're welcome.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm not
the only success story.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.210 align:middle line:90%
So many success stories.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FENTON: Especially
the touching ones,

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.680 align:middle line:84%
where Dr. Burzynski
treated patients

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:84%
as infants that are
now thriving adults.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Burzynski,
you're a blessing.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: There's no other way.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being with us today, Jodi.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.580 align:middle line:90%
This is such--

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Thank you.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.292 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Such a beautiful moment.

00:40:20.292 --> 00:40:22.562 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for sharing
it with everyone.

00:40:22.562 --> 00:40:23.395 align:middle line:90%
>>FENTON: Thank you.

00:40:23.395 --> 00:40:25.527 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank you.

00:40:25.527 --> 00:40:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So with all of this
research and everything

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing,
did you continue

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.747 align:middle line:84%
to proceed with the FDA
and getting their approval?

00:40:32.747 --> 00:40:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what was
the outcome there?

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, definitely
we did it all the time,

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:84%
because we understood that if
you like to bring medication

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to the American people, we
need to have FDA approval.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we did.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.120 align:middle line:84%
We did numerous clinical
trials, phase I,

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.720 align:middle line:84%
phase II clinical
trials, then randomized

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.200 align:middle line:84%
controlled clinical trials,
which proved without any doubt

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that we can get rid of some
of the toughest cancers.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:84%
However, this was just
in clinical trials.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:84%
We still needed the final
stamp of FDA approval to say,

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.250 align:middle line:90%
well, it's working this way.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And we are not at
this level yet.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.300 align:middle line:84%
We have one medication
which received permission

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.950 align:middle line:84%
as prescription medication,
but two other medications

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
which are given
intravenously are still

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:21.520 align:middle line:84%
permitted for phase
III clinical trials,

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:84%
but they're not yet
prescription medication.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But because of the new law,
which is Right to Try law,

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.650 align:middle line:84%
we can now use these medications
for terminal cancer patients.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is the development
of the last three years,

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:84%
when the new law has been
introduced and permitted

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.610 align:middle line:84%
terminal cancer patients to
have access to medication which

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:43.910 align:middle line:90%
are still investigational.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And this changed
a lot of things,

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.030 align:middle line:84%
because now we have
much better results

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.202 align:middle line:90%
and much faster results.

00:41:50.202 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so at
what point did you

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:84%
start working with these
immunotherapy drugs

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
in combination
with the ANP groups

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to combine this for
such amazing results?

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.870 align:middle line:84%
When did that happen
along the line?

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, it happened
when the other drugs became

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.633 align:middle line:90%
And this was 1999.

00:42:09.633 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Before that, there was
nothing else available,

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and it was only antineoplastons
in clinical trials.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.940 align:middle line:90%
And we had variable success.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:90%
We had 60% response.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.920 align:middle line:84%
In the other tumors, we
had only 15% response,

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.890 align:middle line:84%
because they were
different genes.

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But when the new
medication occurs,

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.580 align:middle line:84%
this opened the
new perspectives,

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:84%
because these medications
covered additional genes.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Currently, we have
130 medications,

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.320 align:middle line:84%
which are permitted by
FDA to treat various genes

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and to work through
the immune system.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:90%
This is a very large number.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is
increasing every week.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So because of this, patients
have now much greater chance,

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.730 align:middle line:90%
because we run genomic study.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.400 align:middle line:84%
We find that we cover
most important genes,

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.190 align:middle line:84%
but there's still one or two
genes which are not covered,

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:02.050 align:middle line:84%
then we prescribe the medication
which is now available.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Not a chemotherapy, but
gene-targeted therapy.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Patient may take just
one tablet a day,

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and we have great success.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Just a life-and-death situation,
because the development

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:90%
moved so quickly.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But still the same principle
was the golden standard.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Find out how the cancer
look under microscope,

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.380 align:middle line:84%
put the label on the
cancer, and treat

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.225 align:middle line:84%
the way the
Washingtonian will tell

00:43:27.225 --> 00:43:30.240 align:middle line:84%
you to treat every patient,
according-- using combination

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.070 align:middle line:90%
of chemotherapy, whatever.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And the oncologists
are afraid to do

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:84%
different things,
because they're

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.972 align:middle line:84%
afraid that they
will be persecuted

00:43:38.972 --> 00:43:39.930 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of thing.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:40.888 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So standardized.

00:43:40.888 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: But now, they
should realize every cancer

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.615 align:middle line:90%
patient is somewhat different.

00:43:44.615 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This is
what you're doing.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: That's what we do.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: This is tailor made.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.197 align:middle line:84%
Two people come to you
with the same condition,

00:43:50.197 --> 00:43:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
treat them differently--

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Absolutely.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --based on what their
genetic pool is showing you.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Absolutely.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you treat a
large number of patients,

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.520 align:middle line:90%
then you find certain rules.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.700 align:middle line:84%
For instance, uniformly
deadly malignant brain tumor,

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.040 align:middle line:90%
glioblastoma.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Glioblastoma now
can be subdivided

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:12.102 align:middle line:84%
on four different subtypes
based on genomic analysis.

00:44:12.102 --> 00:44:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Under microscope,
they're the same,

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.030 align:middle line:84%
but based on genome
analysis, you

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:90%
have four different subtypes.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And we found that we
are getting the best

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.440 align:middle line:84%
results in classical
type of GBM, which

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.240 align:middle line:84%
is covering some 85%
population of these patients.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So when we have patient who
is coming to us with GBM,

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.300 align:middle line:84%
we know that there's
something like 85% chance

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that they will respond if we
use approach for classical GBM.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So we can start treatment,
because the time is very

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.980 align:middle line:90%
important for these people.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
make some changes

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.390 align:middle line:84%
after we get genomic
analysis to design

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:48.300 align:middle line:90%
this for this particular case.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So this means that
after we treat a larger

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.560 align:middle line:84%
number of patients, we
may be able to come up

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:84%
with certain regimen which
may work say for 60%, 80%,

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.170 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And for patients who have
a very short lifespan,

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.620 align:middle line:84%
this will be very important
to start it right away.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, based on
genomic analysis,

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:13.830 align:middle line:84%
we can make changes to make
sure that we covered everything.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Dr. Burzynski,
what can patients

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.938 align:middle line:84%
expect when they come to see
you in your clinic in Houston?

00:45:17.938 --> 00:45:20.605 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: First of all, these
patients have traveled in to us

00:45:20.605 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want them to travel
in vain if we cannot help them.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we are
reviewing medical records

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to see if we can really
help with these patients.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
types of cancers

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.190 align:middle line:84%
which we don't accept,
because we know that we don't

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.710 align:middle line:90%
have really such great results.

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:middle line:84%
But when the
patient comes to us,

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.300 align:middle line:84%
then we try to do genomic
analysis as soon as possible.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.930 align:middle line:90%
We try to do some other--

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.870 align:middle line:84%
start with evaluation like
scans, laboratories, whatever.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And we like to start
them on the treatment

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:55.167 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, because they have
a very short life expectancy.

00:45:55.167 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And we would like to
know within two, three,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.070 align:middle line:84%
four weeks if the
treatment is working.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And we usually can tell
that it's working or not.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.630 align:middle line:90%
If it's working, it's great.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.643 align:middle line:84%
We are moving
forward, and our goal

00:46:05.643 --> 00:46:06.810 align:middle line:90%
is to get rid of the tumors.

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Then get rid of the genes.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.850 align:middle line:84%
If we see that it's not working,
then we tell the patient, look,

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately in your case, we
cannot get rid of your cancer.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's still-- maybe try
something else, whatever.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And our approach from
the very beginning

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.600 align:middle line:90%
is to try to cure cancer.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not palliative treatment.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Palliative treatment they
can have everywhere else,

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.800 align:middle line:84%
but we are trying to see
can we get rid of this?

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.510 align:middle line:84%
If we cannot, we
tell the patient,

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:34.950 align:middle line:90%
you should try something else.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But with current availability
of the medications

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:42.347 align:middle line:84%
and also the ability of
doing genomic analysis,

00:46:42.347 --> 00:46:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and the patient does
not need to spend money

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.090 align:middle line:84%
for this, because
it's covered, then I

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
think it opens a
completely new field.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Phenomenal.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: So now the
doctors should understand

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that they can treat
successfully many

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.720 align:middle line:90%
different of advanced cancer.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.410 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting on the
gold mine of medication

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.480 align:middle line:84%
which can really help
these people, if they

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.920 align:middle line:90%
use this in the right way.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I published the
results of our treatment.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I presented the idea, how
to successfully approach

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the treatment of
malignant brain tumors,

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.580 align:middle line:84%
advanced colon cancer,
pancreatic cancer,

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:90%
a tough type of lung cancer.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So I shared this information
with the other doctors.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.920 align:middle line:90%
It's available.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They can do it today
if they want to.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:32.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's up to them.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're an
amazing individual.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank you.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And have done a
tremendous thing for humanity.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank you.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: With Dr.
Burzynski's work,

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.110 align:middle line:84%
we see a shift from the
treatment of cancer cells

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:47.120 align:middle line:90%
to the treatment of sick genes.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a paradigm shift in
the way we approach cancer

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.530 align:middle line:90%
all together.

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I believe that
it's going to develop this way,

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and this was proposed by
some very important people,

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.980 align:middle line:84%
like for instance the head of
the National Cancer, et cetera.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.250 align:middle line:84%
They foresee that the
future of oncology

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:07.160 align:middle line:84%
will be to identify the genes
which are causing the problem

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and treat these genes
across the board.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So not treat just
the name of cancer.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Treat the genes which
are causing cancer.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a moment.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's just reflect
back on what was it

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that had you want to begin
to study and research

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:23.982 align:middle line:84%
cancer and this entire
different approach?

00:48:23.982 --> 00:48:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Where did that begin for you?

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
initially I was not

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.320 align:middle line:90%
so much interested in cancer.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I was interested in aging.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So when I was something
like 22 or 23 years old,

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I was planning to really do
more research on aging process.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But then I discovered
the new chemicals

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.740 align:middle line:84%
in patients, which were
present in normal individuals

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and deficient in cancer patient.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to see if these
chemicals can do something

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.610 align:middle line:90%
for cancer patients.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I isolated
them, and I tested them,

00:48:56.870 --> 00:49:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and then I spent six years on
the National Cancer Institute

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.660 align:middle line:84%
grant to develop them further
to prove the point that,

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:10.280 align:middle line:84%
yes, everybody has chemicals
which can fight cancer, which

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.310 align:middle line:84%
can kill cancer cells
without killing normal cells.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And they can be developed
into medications,

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.303 align:middle line:84%
and these medications
can be used.

00:49:17.303 --> 00:49:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we found that
they work on the genes,

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.080 align:middle line:84%
because at that time, nobody
really know about these genes

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:22.880 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.130 align:middle line:90%
And this opened a new field.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you've spoken about
comparing the genomic DNA

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.283 align:middle line:90%
with a quantum computer.

00:49:32.283 --> 00:49:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Can you just say a little
bit more about that?

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Absolutely.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, so basically,
we have a program

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:45.560 align:middle line:84%
in our body, which directs
the cells to developing

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.120 align:middle line:90%
cancerous way.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So this program
consists of usually

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:84%
from 40 to 650 abnormal genes,
but they hijack normal genes.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So the total
network is something

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:03.830 align:middle line:84%
like 4,000 genes,
which conspire to build

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:06.350 align:middle line:90%
malignant tumors in our body.

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.820 align:middle line:90%
So this is a computer program.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But this computer works
at the molecular level.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's not exactly
like quantum computers

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:16.940 align:middle line:84%
which are now developed
based on electrons,

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.980 align:middle line:90%
which are called qubits.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So these are quantum
computers, which

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.890 align:middle line:84%
are developed based on
encoding of information,

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:29.030 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the molecules
and transferring quantum

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:32.090 align:middle line:84%
of energy from one
molecule to another

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to really get this
process going on.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it works.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So the body has
quantum computers,

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.400 align:middle line:84%
which work to develop
normal functional body.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And if they fail,
they develop cancer.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So we need to do what
is called a cyber

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:52.910 align:middle line:84%
war to get rid of the problem in
the body, which is instructing

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:54.350 align:middle line:90%
how to make cancer.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:55.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it works.

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, right now,
we are manipulating

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.260 align:middle line:90%
this with genomic switches.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.080 align:middle line:84%
We are using chemicals,
which can turn on and off

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.960 align:middle line:90%
the activity of the genes.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I think the future will be
quantum switches, quantum

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:12.080 align:middle line:84%
energy, which will cause turning
on genes and turning off genes.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But we need to know precisely
what kind of quantum energy

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.560 align:middle line:84%
we need to use, what
frequencies or whatever.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.265 align:middle line:84%
Unless you be done
like Dr. McCoy.

00:51:20.265 --> 00:51:22.980 align:middle line:90%


00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So is the objective to
destroy the cancerous genomic

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.900 align:middle line:84%
circumstance or is
it to just subdue it?

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.600 align:middle line:90%
What is the objective there?

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: We would like
to destroy cancerous genome.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.370 align:middle line:84%
In our body, we
have normal genome,

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.850 align:middle line:84%
which is governing the
function of our body.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But there is also
cancerous genome, which

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.800 align:middle line:90%
is present in cancerous cells.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
between these two

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:53.040 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps from 40 to
650 abnormal genes.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Cancer genome needs
to be destroyed.

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And it can be destroyed,
because you can see initially

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.130 align:middle line:90%
these genes in the blood.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Then ultimately they
may be completely gone.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And is this the objective
results that we're looking for?

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:09.750 align:middle line:84%
How soon do you see
these shifts happening

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.110 align:middle line:90%
once treatment has begun?

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, we need
to get rid of the tumors,

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.915 align:middle line:84%
because as long as you
have tumors, obviously

00:52:15.915 --> 00:52:18.180 align:middle line:84%
you are going to
have abnormal genes.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It takes from one
month to four months

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.882 align:middle line:90%
if the patient is funded.

00:52:21.882 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Then after that,
we need to get rid

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.810 align:middle line:84%
of abnormal genes,
which typically

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:27.120 align:middle line:90%
takes about three months.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.620 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
understand that this

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.950 align:middle line:84%
is at the level of 1
billion parts of a gram

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:34.470 align:middle line:90%
per cubic cc of blood.

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be that we still have
abnormal genes at 1 quadrillion

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:39.150 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But our methods are not
precise enough to do it.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:45.212 align:middle line:84%
So when we see that the
abnormal genes are gone,

00:52:45.212 --> 00:52:47.670 align:middle line:84%
we still would like to continue
treatment for another three

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:50.830 align:middle line:84%
months to know that we
eliminated everything.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And then really repeat
the test from time

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.150 align:middle line:84%
to time to see if we
did the right job,

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.690 align:middle line:84%
if these genes are gone for
good or if they are coming.

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:00.695 align:middle line:84%
If they are coming back,
use the treatment again

00:53:00.695 --> 00:53:02.070 align:middle line:84%
for a short time,
get rid of them

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:03.540 align:middle line:84%
before the tumors
have developed.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: This
was the idea which

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.750 align:middle line:84%
was presented by the head of the
National Cancer Institute, Dr.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Margaret Bernadine Healy,
who was saying that that's

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:16.700 align:middle line:84%
how the future of
medicine would look like,

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's around 2008.

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, she died
from a brain tumor.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.637 align:middle line:84%
But that's what she was
proposing, that this would

00:53:23.637 --> 00:53:24.720 align:middle line:90%
be the future of medicine.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Just find these tiny
changes in the genes,

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.590 align:middle line:84%
treat this, get
rid of the disease,

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.875 align:middle line:84%
and then follow up
if this is for good

00:53:33.875 --> 00:53:35.190 align:middle line:90%
or it's still coming back.

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:37.148 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's too bad she
wasn't under your care.

00:53:37.148 --> 00:53:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
unfortunately, she didn't.

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:40.993 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what is
your current project?

00:53:40.993 --> 00:53:42.160 align:middle line:90%
What are you working on now?

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.743 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
currently, we would

00:53:43.743 --> 00:53:47.740 align:middle line:84%
like to finish the project
which FDA wanted us to do,

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.920 align:middle line:84%
which means modify our
pharmaceutical facility,

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.530 align:middle line:90%
and we are finishing this now.

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:57.660 align:middle line:10%
Then we like to move with two
additional products, which

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:01.680 align:middle line:10%
we've been trying to obtain
FDA approval for the treatment

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.120 align:middle line:10%
of recurrent
glioblastoma, which is,

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.090 align:middle line:10%
as you can see
very deadly disease

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.420 align:middle line:10%
and in which you can
have quick results.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But we would like to have
two projects in this area,

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:12.990 align:middle line:84%
one is the treatment
which is administered

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:16.020 align:middle line:84%
in tablets and the other
the treatment administered

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:19.930 align:middle line:84%
intravenously, depending how
bad is the patient's condition.

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, we
would like to have

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:24.410 align:middle line:84%
similar product in
pancreatic cancer-- advanced

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:26.790 align:middle line:90%
p0ancreatic cancer.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, if we
have additional resources,

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:32.070 align:middle line:84%
we would like to go back
to the projects which

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:37.650 align:middle line:84%
we did in the past like aging
project and brain research,

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:40.650 align:middle line:90%
which is memory and Alzheimer.

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we abandoned
this, because we

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:48.840 align:middle line:84%
didn't have enough resources,
and we didn't have enough time

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:90%
to be involved in this.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But in the aging project,
we are able to extend

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:55.140 align:middle line:84%
the life in animal
experiments something

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:58.470 align:middle line:84%
like three to five times
in animal experiments.

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And in Alzheimer project,
we are able to identify

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:06.820 align:middle line:84%
the genes which are switched
off in Alzheimer's patients.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is causing
the neurons to die.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Last week, there
was a big bad news

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that the current research on
the Alzheimer's was directed

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.540 align:middle line:84%
on removing amyloid
plaque failed completely,

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:26.910 align:middle line:84%
because the patient, the plaques
will reduce, they got worse.

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So now we need to move
in different direction.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: In different direction.

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: And that's what
I published 12 years ago,

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.850 align:middle line:84%
that there are genes
which are switched off

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.030 align:middle line:90%
in Alzheimer's disease.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is causing
neurons to die.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.040 align:middle line:84%
If they can be turned on,
then hopefully the neurons

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:45.840 align:middle line:90%
will survive.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can alleviate
the problem.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This whole world of
epigenetics and allowing genes

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:52.610 align:middle line:90%
to be turned on.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Genetically,
these genes can be turned on.

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And the question is to design
new generation of medication,

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.680 align:middle line:84%
which can be done because
the research in this area

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.180 align:middle line:90%
moved very fast.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I know what genes are
involved, and these genes

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.510 align:middle line:84%
need to be simply
turned on genetically.

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:11.085 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: So it can be done.

00:56:11.085 --> 00:56:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Well, I'm
thrilled to hear

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:84%
that you're behind the wheel
on this type of research,

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.810 align:middle line:84%
because you are
helping to steward

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:21.570 align:middle line:84%
this in a different direction,
which is greatly, greatly

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:22.435 align:middle line:90%
needed.

00:56:22.435 --> 00:56:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah.

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.103 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank you, Dr. Burzynski.
