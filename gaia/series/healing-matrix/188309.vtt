>>SUE MORTER: What holds
people back from healing?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it that we continue to keep
seeing ourselves as victims

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
instead of taking responsibility
for our well-being?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.668 align:middle line:84%
And why is gratitude so
important for our body temple?

00:00:39.668 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are going to
talk with Reverend Michael

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Beckwith about why
it is important

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
grow up and show up

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:90%
if we wish to heal and evolve.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:84%
33 years ago, Reverend
Michael created a community

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:84%
in his living room that
has grown to 9,000 members,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and over a million
people worldwide.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.098 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the
power of Agape.

>>MICHAEL BECKWITH: You're
at the center of divine joy.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.932 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: The
center of divine joy.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You're at the
center of divine beauty.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%

of divine beauty.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:90%

>>AUDIENCE: Divine well-being.

the center of life.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm at
the center of life.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: I love life.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I love life.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: And life loves me.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, I can feel it even
as I'm speaking about Agape.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I love the community because
it's all about love--

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.225 align:middle line:84%
loving beyond
what's comfortable.

00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that's been
one of the greatest

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:90%
gifts Agape has given me.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:10%
>> The healing for me came
as my commitment deepened,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:10%
my practice deepened.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:90%
I was at Agape all the time.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.950 align:middle line:84%
From that day on, I
was in classes, or help

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
with fundraising,
and whatever I could

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
do to be a part of
our blessed community.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> One of Reverend Michael's
sayings that I love is give

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.581 align:middle line:90%
to live until you live to give.

00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:12.182 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: I love God.

00:02:12.182 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:90%

the holy breath.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Ahh.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.265 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Wow.

00:02:47.265 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Reverend
Michael, you have

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
been an amazing piece
of my life as well,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and I can't wait to get into
this conversation with you,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and dig in.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But first, we want to start with
where this all began for you.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.013 align:middle line:90%
You had an awakening in college.

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:01.813 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: I did.

00:03:01.813 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I had several.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:10%
But my awakening as--

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:10%
my first awakening as an adult
was in my last year at USC.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.370 align:middle line:10%
I was a psychobiology
major, and I was on track

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:10%
to go to med school.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:10%
And I began to have a
series of inner experiences.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:10%
And at that time, I labeled
the experiences pathological,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:10%
because you don't want to
tell your teachers that you're

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:10%
hearing voices, or having
visions, or leaving your body.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what any of that was.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't studied any
of that material.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it culminated
with these men chasing me

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:90%
in a lucid dream.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
This went on for a
long period of time.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And then one night,
they were very close.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I could even make out
the features on their face.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And I decided not
to run anymore.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I looked around, and there
was a small tent behind me,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
with thousands of people
trying to fit into this tent.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And I knew every
single person in line.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
they can't hurt me.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I have all of my
friends with me.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Then one by one, they all
turned their back on me.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Two men grabbed me.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:84%
One man took a knife and
plunged it into my heart.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And the pain was excruciating
physically and emotionally.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:90%
I screamed out and I died.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke
up, I could see I

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
was surrounded by this
tremendous beauty that

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:90%
was indescribable.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The love that was
penetrating my being

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
was beyond anything I'd
ever experienced in life.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And so my name for
the presence of God

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:84%
was love beauty, because
the beauty everywhere--

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:84%
the lint on the rug glowing with
the luminosity of the presence,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:90%
everything shining.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt penetrated by
love in every cell of my being.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that things
had changed for me.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And the box I was
living in at that time,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I never could get
back in it again.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
calling up a woman who

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:84%
was a friend of my family's
who was a spiritual counselor.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.015 align:middle line:84%
I thought what she
was doing was sweet,

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:19.328 align:middle line:84%
but I hadn't had
much interest in it.

00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And I called her up, and
I said I know everything

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And she said really, baby?

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
I said yeah.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I said we're living in it.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:90%
It's living in us.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And I began my
sojourn to discover

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
what had happened to
me, and then over years,

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
integrating into that
expanded awareness.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:90%
It was very powerful.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I know.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:84%
It is a life changing
reality when we wake up

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
from the reality we were
living in right into a greater

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:90%
picture.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And healing happens on
every level in our lives

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.092 align:middle line:84%
under those-- under
those conditions.

00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You know, one of
the things that I was aware of

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
is that when that happened,
it's like worry disappeared.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was
looking at humanity,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was worried about
something, and afraid of this,

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and afraid of death,
and afraid of loss.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
It was like I don't have
anything to worry about.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: There was nothing left.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Everything
just fell off.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You've
mentioned in describing

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.289 align:middle line:90%
that that fear died that night.

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:17.872 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah,
fear, yeah, it was--

00:06:17.872 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And can you
say more about that?

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It was like people
live in a kind of anxiousness

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:90%
or anxiety about the future--

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen
if I lose my job?

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen if
this happens, or-- you know.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And they create all
kind of mental scenarios

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that they experience even
if it doesn't happen,

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:90%
because it's in their thinking.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And all-- everything
just completely stopped.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And the fear dissolved,
worry dissolved.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
period of time where

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.147 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any friends,
because everybody thought

00:06:49.147 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
that I was really weird.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So I lost all my
friends at the time.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thought
I just freaked out.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But I was just so
present and so alive

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that eventually, the people
that came into my life

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:84%
were more into the frequency
of who I was at that moment.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then someone from
your past sought you out--

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
high school, a woman
from high school

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.908 align:middle line:90%
found you for counseling--

00:07:15.908 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Oh my
god, yes, yes, yes.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --and wanted
you to speak with her.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.308 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You
know what happened?

00:07:20.308 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in my
living room, and I

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
was wanting to know what I
wanted to do with my life.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And the phone rang,
and she called me.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said I found your
phone number in the high school

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.255 align:middle line:84%
annual, and I was
guided to call you.

00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I've been having all
these particular issues,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.458 align:middle line:84%
and I was told that
you could help me.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So I began to do
spiritual counseling

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.537 align:middle line:90%
on the phone with this woman.

00:07:41.537 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for
a period of time.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I helped her through
a lot of things.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I
was at a restaurant.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
I saw her in line.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.923 align:middle line:84%
Now keep in mind, I hadn't seen
this woman since high school.

00:07:51.923 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:90%
And we never saw each other.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:90%
This was all done on the phone.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:90%
So one day I saw her in line.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:90%
I said oh, there she is.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So I called out her name,
and she looked at me,

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:90%
and she left the restaurant.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
She was so embarrassed,
because she'd

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle line:84%
give up what she thought were
like dark secrets and things

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.232 align:middle line:90%
she was working through.

00:08:10.232 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
It was good for her when
I was like this person

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:90%
on the other end--

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Way over there.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.922 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: --praying for
her, and giving her guidance.

00:08:15.922 --> 00:08:17.525 align:middle line:90%
When she actually saw me--

00:08:17.525 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Makes it real.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: --she
never called me again.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought to
myself, I didn't even

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
have this phone
number in high school.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.345 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, my
phone was unlisted.

00:08:29.345 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how
she got the number.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This was a
cosmic phone call.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.695 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It was
a cosmic phone call.

00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And it put me on the
trajectory of what

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:90%
I were to do in my life.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.122 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, it
started to align you.

00:08:38.122 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And then that
parlayed into Agape.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah, it parlayed.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I started seeing
people one on one,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and then I got a spiritual
counseling license later on.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I was seeing people--

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:84%
six to eight people every
single day for years.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would see miracles, and
all kinds of manifestation,

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and people's lives changing.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And then that parlayed into me
going to the School of Higher

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness to get a degree.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough-- so I wasn't going

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.965 align:middle line:90%
there to start a community.

00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I was going there
because I liked

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:84%
being in the frequency
of people who

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:84%
had something to offer in
terms of a higher conversation.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to class.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:84%
It took me five years to go
through a three-year program,

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
because I had no
interest in graduating.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I just liked meeting
certain teachers.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
If they had something, I would
take that class, you know,

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
if they had a new way of
languaging some of my insights.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.328 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, the Assistant
Dean said to me, Michael,

00:09:33.328 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:90%
when are you going to graduate?

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not
trying to graduate.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:36.593 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Graduate?

00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: She said--

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.843 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: This is about graduating?

00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: She said
you are aware that when

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
you graduate, as alumni,
all classes are free?

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:90%
I said really?

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Oh, I'll
graduate next month.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: So I took a full
load and got out of there.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this
intense pressure from inside

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:90%
to start a community.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.825 align:middle line:84%
And I resisted that
for a long time,

00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
because I was in another
spiritual community.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.105 align:middle line:90%
I was running the youth program.

00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I was doing
spiritual counseling.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I was doing classes, workshops.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I had a pretty
full life already,

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want to take
on starting something.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, my
resistance was worn down.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So right,
eventually, it just

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:90%
has to unfold, our destiny.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here at the
"Healing Matrix,"

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
all about pulling together
all the ways that people heal.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
happens that allows

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:84%
for healing to happen
in an individual's life,

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:84%
in their body, in
every aspect of them,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:90%
every dimension of their being?

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
people are seeking

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:90%
when they come to Agape?

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
When they're seeking a
spiritual avenue toward healing,

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
what kind of healing
are they seeking?

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:90%
What's behind that?

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You know, there's
so much in so many levels.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, an
individual is seeking

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:90%
to connect with themselves.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They have gotten--
as I say, they've

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
gotten aligned with
the content flowing

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:90%
through their consciousness.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And they think that
content is who they are--

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
their experiences,
their interpretation

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.530 align:middle line:90%
of past experiences.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And that content has produced
experience in their life--

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
coagulation,
stagnation, ill health,

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.610 align:middle line:90%
stagnation around success.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they're seeking to have
an awareness, an awakening

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:90%
as to who they are--

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
their real identity,
not the son or daughter

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
of a parent, not
where they were born,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:84%
not what school they went
to, but an actual awareness,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
a growing awareness
as to who they really

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
are as a nominal being,
spiritual being, a timeless

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's big.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.043 align:middle line:84%
So many of them don't
know that consciously

00:11:46.043 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:90%
that's what they're seeking.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.418 align:middle line:84%
They think they want a better
employment, or a better

00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
relationship, you know,
they want the stuff.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Which there's nothing
wrong with that at all.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.035 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, they
want to know themselves.

00:11:56.035 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: They really want
to know who they are.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.510 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And you and I both
know that that

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
is at the root of all healing,
when that answer starts

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
to come forth, and we start
to land and connect with that,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:90%
healing starts to unfold.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:90%
It can't not.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It's the
natural by-products.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Because we are that.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Because healing
is actually a revelation.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the revealing
of our intrinsic wholeness,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that we can't add anything
to ourselves at all.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:84%
We're already-- there's already
a perfection that's unfolding.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're doing
is wiping away the dust.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:84%
We're getting away the
grit, the perceptions,

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.220 align:middle line:84%
the limited point of
view, so people can see.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
People suffer from a
spiritual astigmatism.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:90%
They can't see reality.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:90%
They can't see themselves.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And they only experience
their thoughts about reality.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't expect reality
at all, only their thoughts

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, as you said,
once we know who we are, then

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.438 align:middle line:84%
the natural thing
that happens is

00:12:49.438 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
there's a revelation of
wholeness in areas of our life.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:90%
We become like a child again.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.698 align:middle line:90%
The innocence is there.

00:12:54.698 --> 00:12:55.907 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a shelf life.

00:12:55.907 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have an
expiration date.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, exactly.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:90%
More on that.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So we want to share a story
about how Reverend Michael's

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
teaching helped a Gaia member
through her darkest times.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:90%
My name's Julie.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not only
a member of Gaia,

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.992 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also a staff
member here at Gaia.

00:13:14.992 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
you Reverend Michael

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Beckwith and his church Agape
literally saved my life.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It all started
about 16 years ago

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
when my sister gave
birth to her first son.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:84%
She ended up with
cervical cancer,

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and she died four days
after he turned two.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:90%
It was traumatic.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
It was just as you would
expect it to be-- surreal.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Just when I thought I
could get through that,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.527 align:middle line:90%
my father died six months later.

00:13:46.527 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
what was happening.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:90%
My sister had just died.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:90%
I just lost my sister.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I had this baby that
I'm trying to figure out

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
how to help raise
with his father,

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:90%
and now my own father is dead.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Six months after my
dad died, my mom died.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I remember talking
to her, saying

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:90%
you can't die on me, Mom.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:84%
We just went through two
funerals back to back.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
I'm not going to die.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know,
she's on life support.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was literally faced
with taking her off life

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:90%
support while she was awake.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Three deaths, back to back--

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I barely had time to breathe
before someone else was dying.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
what was going on.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.405 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand how all
of this could be going on.

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
was going on with me.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:90%
I was really lost.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I was living in Los
Angeles at the time.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.082 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to
Reverend Beckwith's--

00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:90%
a service on a Wednesday night.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
being flooded with love.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.770 align:middle line:84%
What he was preaching
about was about gratitude,

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and I could find nothing
to be grateful for.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But I remember the way
he gave his sermon.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
He said if you can
just find one thing--

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
because when you're in
a state of gratitude,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:90%
you're in a state of love.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept
listening to what he

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
was saying about how
to heal your heart,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and how you have to
find it within yourself.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I just kept going
and kept going.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And he would have
amazing speakers.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And I would go to his
Quiet Mind Bookstore.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:84%
The bookstore was
filled with books

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:84%
about healing yourself,
and healing your soul,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and healing your heart,
from Neale Donald Walsch,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to obviously Reverend
Beckwith himself,

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:90%
to many, many other authors.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
books that I got

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:90%
was called "The Answer is You."

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just underlining
and circling, and underlining

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and circling, and going
back, and hearing his voice

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:90%
in my head--

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:90%
you have to heal yourself.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And so through that
process, one Sunday,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
he was coming out
to the congregation

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
to talk to people
about their stories.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:90%
And I remember raising my hand.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And he came to me.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just was crying,
saying you saved me.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:90%
You got me through this.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to
a place where I

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
knew if I hadn't gone
through all that death,

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I would never be to the
resolution where I am now.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%
So Reverend Beckwith, thank you.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for healing my heart.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for teaching
me how to heal myself.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
giving me a new life.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:48.522 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.522 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Wow.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.602 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Countless times.

00:16:51.602 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:90%
What a beautiful thing.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And now she's on
a team of people

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
that are bringing healing
conversations to people

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.225 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: All
around the world.

00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Because she found
this part of herself

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:90%
that we're speaking about.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.460 align:middle line:84%
You spoke about
gratitude in the video,

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.952 align:middle line:84%
about just finding
this one thing.

00:17:06.952 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:84%
You just have to find
something to be grateful for.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share
with our viewers

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about the
power of gratitude,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:90%
or what role that's playing?

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude expands
our perception.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like if we're
focused and worried

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
about something in our life,
then all of our attention

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:84%
is going towards a possible
worst case scenario.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And we experience that
biologically, chemically.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So if we shift our attention
and go to one little--

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have
to be monumental--

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
one thing to be grateful
for, our perception

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:90%
begins to expand.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So it begins with
finding one thing.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And then something
begins to happen.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to take your
attention away from the thing.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.428 align:middle line:84%
And you're in a
field of gratitude.

00:17:58.428 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be about anything.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.053 align:middle line:90%
You're just in this field.

00:18:01.053 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a higher state
of consciousness.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.777 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
in this field--

00:18:06.777 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if people
have ever experienced this,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
but I know that my mother
would sometimes say--

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:90%
not to me, but to my brothers--

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
if you don't stop crying,
I'm gonna give you

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.587 align:middle line:90%
something to cry about.

00:18:17.587 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the law works
like this-- if you

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.032 align:middle line:84%
don't stop being grateful,
then the law will vibrationally

00:18:22.032 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
match, and give you more
and more to be grateful for.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Give you something
to be grateful for.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning, you find
something to be grateful for.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Then you grow into just
being in gratitude.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
have an object at all.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a very mature
state of gratitude.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.400 align:middle line:84%
You wake up, you
become grateful.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.265 align:middle line:84%
You go through traffic, you're
grateful you've got a car.

00:18:41.265 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
You're in line, you're grateful
you're in the supermarket line.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.523 align:middle line:84%
You can buy some
food, whatever it is.

00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Then after a while,
you're just in this state.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You use it as
a cue to direct you

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.265 align:middle line:90%
into this place of gratitude.

00:18:51.265 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, quantum
science is showing us

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.822 align:middle line:90%
that it's a vibrational field.

00:18:54.822 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And this, when it
comes to healing,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
is so paramount, because we
have to realize that there's

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:84%
a vibrational radio station that
we can dial into where healing

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
happens, and a different
radio station that we

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
can dial into where
healing does not happen.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And people don't realize
that it starts with us.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:84%
It starts with where am I
dialing my frequency into?

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And does healing get to
happen on that bandwidth?

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Or does it not?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes a
part of our practice.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:84%
You actually have a practice
where you practice gratitude.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:90%
You practice Thanksgiving.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You practice appreciation,
until it becomes your way.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
when you're down,

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
that's when you
practice it even more.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And then when
you're expanding, I

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:84%
like to say you
ask the question,

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:90%
how can it get better than this?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And you ask that question if
you're on a downward spiral,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
you're on that frequency
of discomfort, disease,

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:90%
not enoughness.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.198 align:middle line:84%
You say how can it
get better than this?

00:19:50.198 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And then your mind will
start to be flooded

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.515 align:middle line:90%
with how it can get better.

00:19:53.515 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
rising, and you're

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
having a really great day, you
ask the same question-- how

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:90%
can it get better than this?

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we're dealing with
something that's infinite.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you
are, you're barely

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
scratching the surface
of the next moment that

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
wants to emerge through you,
the next gift, the next power,

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:90%
the next revelation.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So you stay in that
frequency until you're

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
living on an arc of
expanded awareness.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you just speak to us about
victim consciousness conversely

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to what we're speaking
about, this consciousness

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude and being
in this expansiveness?

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
someone is locked in to just,

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I just can't get out of it.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:10%
I just can't break through that
barrier, and on a regular basis

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:10%
find this feeling of gratitude.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.418 align:middle line:84%
Well, interestingly
enough, I would

00:20:47.418 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:84%
say that many, many, many people
live in victim consciousness.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They have a belief that
something outside of themselves

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
determines their
destiny, determines

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.220 align:middle line:84%
their happiness, their peace
of mind, their prosperity.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And victims have a victim story.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
If you ask them why aren't
they happy, they know.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.320 align:middle line:84%
They can articulate to a T what
happened, when it happened,

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:90%
who did it to them.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.838 align:middle line:84%
And they know the story so
well, that becomes the lens

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:90%
that they look at life through.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:90%
So they're a victim.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to become aware
of your victim conversation,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
your victim
statements, and begin

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:84%
to move into the vibration
of giving up blame.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
You have to give up blame in
order to take the next step.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness can actually be
summed up into I give up blame.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin to ask other
kind of empowering questions.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:90%
How can I grow from this?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.350 align:middle line:84%
What lesson do I need
to learn from this?

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:84%
What lesson is the universe
giving me right now?

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
is progressive.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go backwards.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly expanding.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You begin to ask a
different set of questions.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
The victim questions are
what's wrong, who's to blame,

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.922 align:middle line:90%
and why me.

00:21:56.922 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:90%
That's where they live.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, it's all out there.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.733 align:middle line:90%
Push it out there.

00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: But when you ask
a different kind of question,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:90%
what lesson am I learning?

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.935 align:middle line:90%
What gift is being honed in me?

00:22:08.935 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
You start to get answers,
because the universe will

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:90%
answer any question you ask.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And it will start to move
you out of victimhood.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
It's going to move you
through forgiveness, too.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
It's going to move
you out of victimhood.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start to
take 100% responsibility

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.475 align:middle line:90%
for your own healing.

00:22:24.475 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And people are afraid
to take that responsibility,

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:27.985 align:middle line:90%
because they feel so lousy.

00:22:27.985 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
The last thing
they want to think

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.412 align:middle line:84%
is I'm responsible
for how lousy I feel.

00:22:31.412 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But responsibility and blame
are not the same thing.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.517 align:middle line:84%
People, they make
them synonymous.

00:22:38.517 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:90%
You have to take responsibility.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:90%
That means it's my fault.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:84%
No, that's not
what we're saying.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:84%
We're saying responsibility
means the ability to respond.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you take
responsibility, you

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:84%
begin to respond to
a higher frequency.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Blame is something else.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Blame and shame and guilt, they
have no transformational value.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:84%
They keep you locked
into an old paradigm.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The egoic structure will
keep you your old self.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But when you ask
a higher question,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:90%
you take responsibility.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I take responsibility
for the thought

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:90%
that's happening right now.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:90%
What is it going to be?

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.108 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be
a victim thought,

00:23:13.108 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
or is it going to be
an empowering thought?

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking
responsibility for that.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to make
me think a certain way.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
happened in my past.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
This present moment
right now, I'm

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
taking responsibility for
my thinking, my perception,

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:84%
what comes out of my mouth,
my conversations, my actions--

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking 100% responsibility.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So then what happens is
inertia then becomes momentum.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
You start to move in the
direction of your higher

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
conversation, and
your life changes,

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
because you've taken
responsibility, not blame.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So another thing that
I've seen with people

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
is that if they're stuck in
shame or guilt, or those kinds

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
of lower vibrational
frequencies,

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:84%
that if they'll just embrace
it, just be present with it,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:90%
just love into that--

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.137 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --then you're
taking this responsibility

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:90%
to that level where you are.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:90%
And it starts things in motion.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: That's
very important.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I don't have to be afraid
of a feeling that I'm feeling.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:84%
If I just feel it,
then it's gone.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Then it's done.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:11.405 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:24:11.405 --> 00:24:12.655 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Then we don't have to--

00:24:12.655 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Plus you're
being present with it.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
When we do exactly what
you just described,

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:84%
you come out of
wishful thinking.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:90%
I wish this hadn't happened.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I wish I wasn't here.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I wish I hadn't done
whatever I did to bring this

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:90%
into manifestation.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Wishful thinking
goes out the window,

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.715 align:middle line:90%
and you just embrace what is.

00:24:31.715 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment of
embracing, something happens.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:84%
You see that you're
actually spiritually bigger

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:90%
than the thing that's going on.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's in your
field, but it's not you.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And then it begins to dissipate
because of your awareness

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:90%
that you're bigger than it.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.270 align:middle line:90%
You've totally embraced it.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:90%
You're not resisting it.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.088 align:middle line:90%
You're not fighting it.

00:24:52.088 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:90%
You're not saying go away.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Say here it is.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:90%
And it gets to dissolve.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: If I can hold space for
it, then I'm bigger than it.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm holding space for it.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a hold of me.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:90%
I can embrace it.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It starts this path
that we're describing.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.538 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Everything.

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You speak about
this path with four stages

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of the development
of consciousness.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share with our
viewers about that structure

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:90%
so they can kind of see that?

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: The first one
we just described is victim.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%
You know, they did it to me.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's somebody else's fault.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.043 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that somebody
didn't do anything to you.

00:25:26.043 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that bad
things didn't happen.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:90%
We're not discounting that.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
We're just saying we're not
living in that frequency.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:90%
We're aware that that happened.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.570 align:middle line:84%
But we can now move out
of that through the power

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.063 align:middle line:84%
of forgiveness, through the
power of giving up blame,

00:25:39.063 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and through the power
of taking responsibility

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:90%
for our own life.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Then we move into stage two.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.445 align:middle line:84%
Stage two is the
manifester stage.

00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:48.945 align:middle line:84%
I'll give it to you
like this first.

00:25:48.945 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
First stage is to us--
something is happening to us.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:90%
The second stage is by us--

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:90%
we're doing something.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:90%
The third stage is through us.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Energy is moving through us.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:90%
The fourth stage is as us.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:90%
We are the energy.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:90%
We are the presence.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So in stage two, you're
using your mind power.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
You're using the art of
visualization, creative use

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.530 align:middle line:90%
of your imagination.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
You're re-enchanting
the imagination

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:90%
to best-case scenarios.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.750 align:middle line:84%
You're changing
your conversation.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:84%
You're learning about
declarations, affirmations,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:84%
writing, how you want
to live your life.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.018 align:middle line:84%
You're basically
re-contextualizing your mind.

00:26:30.018 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:84%
The mind is a set
of laws, set of--

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:90%
in a way we've been inputed.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:90%
You're changing all of that.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:90%
We're doing this.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Then something
happens, and we start

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
to realize that there's
an order in the universe

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't create.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:90%
We didn't create that order.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:90%
We depend on the order.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So then we learn about releasing
ourselves to it-- surrendering,

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:90%
yielding, allowing.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:90%
By us is masculine.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Through us is feminine.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.880 align:middle line:84%
By us is I call it the
Nike stage-- just do it.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Make it happen.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Stage three is make it
welcome, because it's

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:90%
happening cosmically.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So I start to
release myself to it.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm available, but it's
come from the hard work

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I've done on stage two.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't transcend what
you haven't mastered.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So definitely we
master stage two.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:90%
But we yield into stage three.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we begin to
have pinprick awarenesses

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that this life, this
presence, it's us.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:90%
We're it.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
operating through us,

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's operating
and expressing as us.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm in it.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:90%
It's in me.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:90%
There's no separation.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.930 align:middle line:84%
The wave is a
function of the ocean.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.370 align:middle line:84%
The sunbeam is an
expression of the sun.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.050 align:middle line:90%
No sun, no sunbeam.

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:90%
No ocean, no wave.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:90%
No presence, no us.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So we start to have pinprick
awarenesses around that.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And some people
are afraid of that.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.142 align:middle line:90%
They think it's blasphemy.

00:27:58.142 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:84%
You think you can be at
one with God, or at one

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.360 align:middle line:90%
with the presence?

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.630 align:middle line:90%
No, it's blasphemy to limit it.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You see, we don't
want to limit it,

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
because if it's omnipresent,
because it's everywhere,

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.905 align:middle line:84%
it must be where I am,
and it must be who I am.

00:28:12.905 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: This is so powerful.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that even
to repeat this idea

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.608 align:middle line:84%
that it's OK to engage this
way, that it's not blasphemy.

00:28:20.608 --> 00:28:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you're
putting yourself

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:84%
bigger than the universe,
or bigger than God,

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:90%
for that matter.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
participating as part of

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and belonging to
this great wave,

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.260 align:middle line:84%
rather than operating as
a separate self, where

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:90%
healing does not happen.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So can you can you relate
how healing relates

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:90%
inside of your structure?

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Just on a physical level, on
an emotional level, mind, body,

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:47.292 align:middle line:90%
soul, what--

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
can you tie all that
together for people?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.628 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to even say I've
been doing Agape for 33 years.

00:28:54.628 --> 00:28:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I was a counselor
for seven years before that.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been
doing this a long time.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen individuals
have shift of character.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I've seen individuals have
healings of the physical body

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
temple, when the prognosis was
this is not going to happen.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I've seen individuals come
back from tremendous setbacks

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:90%
financially--

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.696 align:middle line:90%
lose businesses.

00:29:18.696 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen it all
across the board, when

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.640 align:middle line:84%
an individual discovers
and participates

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
in their own unfolding,
that they are one with life.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
spiritual self-love

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and a self-appreciation that's
not born from accomplishment,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:84%
but that's intrinsic to who we
are as our spiritual nature.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Revelation occurs.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:84%
People are guided and directed
through their intuition,

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:90%
through--

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.320 align:middle line:84%
their innate wisdom is
activated to do the right thing

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
to bring about what is necessary
for their healing, which

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:90%
is a revelation of wholeness.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:90%
There's no stone unturned.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I remember a woman that was just
graduating from my practitioner

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:90%
class.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the class,
what did you want

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.960 align:middle line:90%
the class to hold space for?

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said I want to be moved
up on the kidney transplant

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:90%
list.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.665 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why don't we try to
heal the kidneys that you have?

00:30:16.665 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said no, the doctors are
saying this is a rare disease.

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
They've never seen any
healing in this area.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:90%
I need to be moved up.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And she was very
resistant to me,

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.830 align:middle line:90%
to saying can we just try it?

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.270 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, I
thought about this story

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that Alan Watts used to
share about his wife.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:90%
His wife is perpetually late.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So he would always lie about the
time to get her to come early,

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:90%
but she was always late.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.528 align:middle line:84%
So one day he's sitting
at Central Park.

00:30:45.528 --> 00:30:47.070 align:middle line:84%
He asked her to come
to lunch, but he

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:84%
said you have to be
on time, because I

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:90%
have to go to a meeting.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.270 align:middle line:90%
She's late.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:90%
His mind starts to go crazy.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't respect me,
doesn't respect my time.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Then he says to himself,
my wife respects me.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.550 align:middle line:90%
She loves me.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.160 align:middle line:84%
She just has a casual
relationship to time.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
While I'm waiting,
I'll meditate.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So she gave him plenty of
opportunity to meditate, OK?

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.040 align:middle line:90%
So that story came into my mind.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her--
her name was Donna.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I said Donna, while we're
waiting for the kidney

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:84%
transplant, why don't
we see what we can do?

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:90%
And she said OK.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.473 align:middle line:90%
So I gave her this book.

00:31:21.473 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:84%
In the book, it talked about
the healing of kidneys,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and how metaphysically there's
stagnation in your life,

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.573 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:31:29.573 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So she had to read
that every day.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Unresolvedness.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Right.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I said to the
class, how many of you

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:84%
today got up and gave thanks
that your kidneys worked

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and you could pee today?

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:90%
And nobody raised their hand.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:90%
I said this is your role--

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.920 align:middle line:84%
every time you go to the
restroom, you pray for Donna.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I called it the
praying while peeing--

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.220 align:middle line:90%
pee pee prayer.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.015 align:middle line:90%
So 30 days later, we meet.

00:31:54.015 --> 00:31:55.640 align:middle line:84%
They're about to take
their oral exams.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.650 align:middle line:90%
And Donna can't wait to share.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:84%
She said her kidneys
spontaneously started working.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors wanted to do
a slight operation to see why.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.920 align:middle line:90%
She refused.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Now that was 10 years ago.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.878 align:middle line:90%
She is still rolling.

00:32:10.878 --> 00:32:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: She has her own kidneys?

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: She has
her own kidneys.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Everything is fine.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:18.553 align:middle line:84%
But she changed her
awareness about it.

00:32:18.553 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And she had a field
of people that

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.490 align:middle line:90%
were holding space for her.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Her kidneys
spontaneously healed.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen that.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You know what's
funny about that?

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not funny.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But about four weeks after
that, this little boy walks up

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to me at Agape, he says my
mommy is going to the hospital.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:84%
She has to have a
kidney transplant.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just said
she's going to be OK.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.380 align:middle line:90%
I just waved my hand over her.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And her kidneys started working.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And she's-- same.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.700 align:middle line:90%
She's at Agape-- nothing.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.500 align:middle line:90%
So I've seen a lot of healings.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think it was
the combination of me

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and her little son, who
were just like Dr. Beckwith

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:90%
with can do anything.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The purity of innocence.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: He was so innocent--

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: 100%.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: --and so pure.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.802 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You know,
epigenetics is teaching us

00:32:56.802 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:84%
that the vibrational
frequency that

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.820 align:middle line:84%
hits the surface of
the cell is picked up

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:90%
by these little antennas.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.732 align:middle line:84%
And then they relate
information inside the cell,

00:33:05.732 --> 00:33:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
tells the cell what

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.940 align:middle line:84%
chemistries-- what chemistries
to produce, or how to function.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And so when someone makes
this declaration that says,

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:84%
hey, I am, and I'm going
to let this happen for me,

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.333 align:middle line:84%
or this is going to
happen for you, Mom,

00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:21.000 align:middle line:84%
because Reverend
Beckwith said it would.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Right, and I
got agreement from her.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: That certainty allows--

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: I mean, yeah.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:90%
I got agreement from her too.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I made her look at me.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I said can we agree with your
son that you're going to be OK?

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I agree.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the mind
field changes,

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and it changes
the message that's

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.680 align:middle line:84%
coming to the
surface of the cells,

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.638 align:middle line:84%
and the cells change the
chemistry that they're

00:33:35.638 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:90%
producing, and the body heals.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: There it is.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's pretty phenomenal.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, you speak about
the feedback loop,

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.820 align:middle line:84%
that this body temple is
the perfect feedback loop.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Can you share about that?

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.022 align:middle line:84%
The detail about
what that means?

00:33:48.022 --> 00:33:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Instead of railing
against the body temple,

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
you basically use
it as feedback.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So if something is going
wrong in your perspective,

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.292 align:middle line:84%
it actually has a
message in there.

00:34:00.292 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you become
still, you can actually

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:84%
ask what is it that
you're telling me?

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.700 align:middle line:90%
And in sincerity, listen--

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
not with your ears,
but with consciousness.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Listen with your entire being.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to get wisdom and
guidance as to where you're out

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.635 align:middle line:90%
of alignment in life.

00:34:17.635 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:84%
It could be in
your conversation.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.560 align:middle line:84%
It could be in some
habits that you have.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.940 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to get feedback
that that particular dis-ease

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:90%
is giving you.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.210 align:middle line:90%
You come back into alignment.

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the dis-ease
becomes ease.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:84%
You come back into harmony,
back into homeostasis, back

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.360 align:middle line:90%
into wholeness.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.760 align:middle line:90%
So the body is feedback.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
What is it saying to
you across the board?

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.050 align:middle line:90%
You need some rest?

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.429 align:middle line:90%
You need nutrition?

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:90%
You need right exercise?

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:90%
You know, what is it?

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Is it something
missing nutritionally?

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:90%
You'll get the feedback.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow
it, if you obey,

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:84%
then the body temple will come
back in a very powerful way.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
body can heal anything.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.220 align:middle line:90%
It's genius.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So do I.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: There's no
disease big enough to--

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.468 align:middle line:84%
if the person is
in alignment, yeah.

00:35:07.468 --> 00:35:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: If we're allowing
that flow to flow,

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and if we're
connecting with that.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And when people
don't know how to do

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.322 align:middle line:84%
that, they get a little afraid
that they are going to be stuck

00:35:17.322 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:84%
on their medications,
they're going

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to have to keep doing what
they're doing, because they

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.910 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to do instead.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And so can you speak to
where would someone start?

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin to know that
you're doing something that's

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:33.740 align:middle line:84%
going to lead to a healing
environment for this body,

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to have the true
role in our life

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.523 align:middle line:84%
that it's really
intended to have?

00:35:39.523 --> 00:35:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: First
of all, you have

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:84%
to realize that there are
people called minor deities,

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.220 align:middle line:84%
MDs, that give you
diagnosis and prognosis.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:84%
You cannot allow them
to give you a prognosis.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:90%
They can give you a diagnosis.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But the prognosis is between you
and you, you and the presence.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to formulate
your own prognosis.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually
tell yourself

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.360 align:middle line:84%
my body can heal
anything, and I am

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.220 align:middle line:84%
the candidate for the
revelation of wholeness.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
begin with yourself.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Many people get
caught up in the--

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.670 align:middle line:84%
under the aegis of
the medical model.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And when a minor deity tells
you something, particularly

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.160 align:middle line:90%
a prognosis, you believe it.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And then as you said,
your cells hear that.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.900 align:middle line:90%
They believe what you believe.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And they start to
produce the chemicals

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.790 align:middle line:90%
according to that belief.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:90%
So you shift your own prognosis.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You actually write
out, you know,

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing for my
body temple to up level

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.870 align:middle line:84%
to complete healing and
wholeness every single day,

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:43.990 align:middle line:90%
getting better every day.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to enter into it
with that kind of vibration.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you choose
a partner that

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.220 align:middle line:90%
holds you accountable to that--

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.172 align:middle line:84%
doesn't let you go
into your pity party,

00:36:52.172 --> 00:36:53.880 align:middle line:84%
doesn't let you go
into a downward spiral

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.930 align:middle line:90%
of conversation.

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:84%
That can be a
spiritual counselor

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:00.120 align:middle line:84%
or a real good
friend, the trust.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.620 align:middle line:84%
You begin to examine
your hydration,

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.877 align:middle line:84%
your nutrition, you
exercise, your rest.

00:37:05.877 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:90%
You begin to examine that.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Where is that off line?

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But it always
begins in the mind.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:16.350 align:middle line:84%
You are a passionate man, and I
have a lot of passion and fire

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.390 align:middle line:90%
about this exact same topic.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also very aware
that we want our viewers

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.727 align:middle line:84%
to be able to plug into
this stream of consciousness

00:37:27.727 --> 00:37:28.810 align:middle line:90%
that we're speaking about.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what can
you say for someone

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:90%
who doesn't feel the passion?

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:84%
That they can write these
goals out for themselves,

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:84%
write their new diagnosis,
but they're not feeling it?

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.058 align:middle line:84%
What role does that
play in the outcome

00:37:43.058 --> 00:37:44.100 align:middle line:90%
that they're looking for?

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: For years--

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you guide
someone in that way?

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: For years, I've
said that this feeling--

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.900 align:middle line:84%
the universe is a
feeling universe.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Feeling provides the context
for healing in one's life.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So I would say
take your attention

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and put it on
something that brings

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.102 align:middle line:90%
about a good feeling for you.

00:38:02.102 --> 00:38:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
about your healing.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.475 align:middle line:84%
It could be about
someone you love.

00:38:05.475 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:84%
It could be a little
kid in your life

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that when you think
about this kid,

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.430 align:middle line:84%
you just feel so much
joy, so much happiness.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Or you think about someone that
gave you a really good gift,

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
not a re-gifting gift, but
something that you really

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.230 align:middle line:84%
loved and appreciated,
and you notice how

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.020 align:middle line:90%
you felt when you received it.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Now when you felt--

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.530 align:middle line:84%
when you received that
gift, your chemistry

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.150 align:middle line:90%
changed at that moment.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.230 align:middle line:90%
You became grateful.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.063 align:middle line:90%
You became thankful.

00:38:29.063 --> 00:38:29.863 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my.

00:38:29.863 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:90%
You came appreciative.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.860 align:middle line:90%
You go back to that moment.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I ask people to close their
eyes, capture that moment,

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and then take some
breaths and amplify it.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Amplify that feeling.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Amplify that feeling, until
you're living in that feeling.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whether you're
thinking about that person

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:90%
or not, you have the feeling.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.360 align:middle line:90%
It's amplified.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.610 align:middle line:90%
Now go into your conversation.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Now go into your affirmation.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Now go into your writing.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Even though the feeling has
come from something else,

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.320 align:middle line:84%
it's still operating
in your body temple.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It's still changing the
chemistry of your body.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.810 align:middle line:84%
It's still opening up
those blood vessels,

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:10.260 align:middle line:84%
so that oxygen is flowing
better-- this greater coherence

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.320 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in league
with the harmony

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
have in your body.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can start
off passionless,

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:84%
but you can actually build up
the passion in your own life.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is the role
of unforgiveness in that?

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.000 align:middle line:90%
How does that fit in?

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: That's a
very important question.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Where there is unforgiveness,
there's stagnation, blockage,

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're thought
forms and perceptions.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And thoughts are units
of mental energy.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And they produce
that same frequency

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.790 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:90%
So it becomes stagnant.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.970 align:middle line:90%
And then it creates perception.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So you actually
see life that way.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And as you see life
that way, you actually

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.810 align:middle line:90%
experience life that way.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:84%
You could be standing in the
middle of great opportunity,

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and won't even see it, because
the unforgiveness is blocking.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.510 align:middle line:84%
The other thing unforgiveness
does is create debt.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are in
resentment towards someone,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.500 align:middle line:84%
or have a level
of unforgiveness,

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.870 align:middle line:84%
the message to the
universe is they

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:84%
stopped me from
having something.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.370 align:middle line:84%
They are preventing me
from having something.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.320 align:middle line:90%
Or they owe me something.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Now in physical life, somebody
might owe you something.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't discount that.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But if you're walking around
with that stagnant thought,

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that I can't be happy because
they owe me something,

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:84%
then the universe
says you have lack.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're
sitting here in lack

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.100 align:middle line:84%
because that person
owes you something.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.860 align:middle line:84%
So that spins out as
lack in your life.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.170 align:middle line:84%
The law says, oh, you
don't have something?

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you what
that looks like.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:47.360 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It has no
choice but to respond

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:49.880 align:middle line:90%
to what we're commanding.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: It doesn't care
whether you're a good person.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:84%
You can be the best person in
the world, follow all the laws,

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.150 align:middle line:84%
pay your taxes, never
run a stop sign.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:84%
You can be a good person,
have a good personality.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But inside, you believe
someone owes you something,

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:84%
or you're lacking something
because of that person,

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.800 align:middle line:90%
then that law operates on that.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And you'll end up having debt
or lack in your life based

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:90%
on unforgiveness.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:15.435 align:middle line:84%
So to empower yourself,
forgiveness is the way.

00:41:15.435 --> 00:41:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Give forth a harmonious energy.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:23.278 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And can you define
forgiveness for our viewers?

00:41:23.278 --> 00:41:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: On one
level, forgiveness

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.840 align:middle line:84%
is the releasing of toxins,
resentment, animosity,

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:90%
grudges that are within us.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.820 align:middle line:84%
All forgiveness is
self-forgiveness.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're trying
to forgive someone else,

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.008 align:middle line:90%
they're not really out there.

00:41:37.008 --> 00:41:39.160 align:middle line:84%
That's a figment of your
imagination, you see.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.110 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
releasing the toxins

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that are within you that you
are projecting onto that person.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you release
those toxic thoughts,

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.000 align:middle line:84%
those units of mental energy,
you become free flowing.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And now life can start to
express through you again.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.830 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do?

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.480 align:middle line:84%
You're cutting the
emotional cords

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that you have with
that individual.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:05.320 align:middle line:84%
You're saying in substance
what you did or did not do

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.560 align:middle line:90%
does not determine my destiny.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.870 align:middle line:90%
I cut myself free from you.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I wish you well,
and I'm moving on.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You end up being able
to be more present with them,

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
love them, and have a
better relationship,

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:22.340 align:middle line:84%
because you actually cut through
the thing that was keeping you

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.080 align:middle line:84%
from being free to be in the
loving presence with them

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.080 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to them.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.038 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:42:27.038 --> 00:42:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Now there are stages
in forgiveness.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.513 align:middle line:90%
The first stage is willingness.

00:42:30.513 --> 00:42:31.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
willing to forgive.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.808 align:middle line:84%
Most people, no, I'm gonna take
this resentment to my grave.

00:42:34.808 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:84%
No, it's going to take--
that resentment is going

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:37.933 align:middle line:90%
to take you to your grave.

00:42:37.933 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Take you to your
grave, sooner, probably.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Right.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.910 align:middle line:90%
So one is willingness.

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Number two is actually the
practice of forgiveness,

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.508 align:middle line:84%
that you actually cut
the cord, let them know--

00:42:48.508 --> 00:42:50.050 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to
be sitting there--

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:54.100 align:middle line:84%
in your own awareness that what
they did or did not do cannot

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:90%
determine their destiny.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:56.810 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.300 align:middle line:90%
I set you free.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
stage is actually

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:05.460 align:middle line:84%
being willing to see something
from their perspective.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just a willingness.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I wonder how
they saw this situation?

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah, very powerful.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: And then
you'll start to open up.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:84%
You say, oh, maybe
they didn't think

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.678 align:middle line:84%
they did such a bad thing,
or maybe they thought they

00:43:14.678 --> 00:43:16.167 align:middle line:90%
were justified, or whatever.

00:43:16.167 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like our Native
American brothers and sisters

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:84%
say, walk a mile in
another person's moccasins.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.130 align:middle line:84%
You actually see something
from another point of view.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Then the next stage is wish
them well, but for real.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Not--

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, good
luck with that.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.010 align:middle line:90%
No that.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah,
but really say it,

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and hope that life works out for
them in a very beautiful way.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the next stage,
which is difficult for people,

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:45.390 align:middle line:84%
is to actually do something
for them anonymously.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.520 align:middle line:90%
Send them $1 in the mail.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Send them a love note.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Just something
that opens you.

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.615 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Open you.

00:43:50.615 --> 00:43:52.930 align:middle line:84%
You're giving-- you're
releasing energy.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
all in your head.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you actually go through
those stages of forgiveness,

00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.640 align:middle line:84%
when you hear that
person's name,

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.280 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to contract.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:84%
You actually want to say
I hope they're doing well.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So let's say that we
have a viewer watching who

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.520 align:middle line:84%
has a diagnosis, or
they're feeling disharmony

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.200 align:middle line:84%
in their life in some
way, or just a disconnect.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:19.830 align:middle line:84%
How might you guide them to
utilize that exact circumstance

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.340 align:middle line:84%
toward an awakening in
their own life experience?

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You kind of gave
the answer in your question,

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.240 align:middle line:84%
and that is we want to
use this for awakening.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:90%
So if someone is going through--

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:90%
they've received a diagnosis.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.263 align:middle line:84%
Instead of railing
against it, you

00:44:36.263 --> 00:44:37.680 align:middle line:84%
come to total--
first thing you do

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.597 align:middle line:84%
is you come to a
total acceptance,

00:44:39.597 --> 00:44:41.680 align:middle line:84%
that this is what's going
on in my life right now.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I have this
diagnosis, whatever it

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.330 align:middle line:90%
is, from cataracts to cancer.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:90%
You say what is it telling me?

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Where's it telling me to shift?

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Where is it telling
me to change?

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:57.820 align:middle line:90%
And I'm receptive to that.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is not
a one and done thing.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.440 align:middle line:90%
This is a daily practice.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's one thing.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Then the next thing
is to actually begin

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to come into a
level of coherence

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:14.170 align:middle line:84%
around your self-worth,
your value, and the gifts

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.380 align:middle line:90%
that you are to give the planet.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to think
about the moments in your life

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:23.380 align:middle line:84%
where you were absolutely--
absolutely loved for no reason.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.980 align:middle line:90%
You didn't win an award.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Somebody just got you.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.793 align:middle line:90%
They just loved you.

00:45:26.793 --> 00:45:28.280 align:middle line:90%
They just appreciated you.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And what did that feel
like to be totally loved?

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Now that unconditional love
is infinitesimal to how much

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.480 align:middle line:90%
the presence loves you.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So you grow into that, so
you're having an awareness

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:43.100 align:middle line:90%
that you're worthy.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.600 align:middle line:90%
You're loved.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.160 align:middle line:90%
You're appreciated.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.500 align:middle line:84%
That becomes the chemical
makeup for your trajectory

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.790 align:middle line:90%
towards healing.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:54.985 align:middle line:84%
So you're asking
what does it mean?

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Now what does it mean doesn't
mean what's the cause of it.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.960 align:middle line:90%
We don't want go--

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.640 align:middle line:84%
the disease doesn't
have a cause,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.520 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't exist
in the spiritual realm.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.380 align:middle line:90%
It has a meaning.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.210 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Where am I out of alignment?

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Where can I grow?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And you combine
that with generating

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:17.390 align:middle line:84%
a level of self-worth, value
in what I have to give.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.310 align:middle line:84%
You combine those
two things together,

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and there will be
movement in your soul,

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and then movement
in your body temple.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:middle line:90%
You speak about awakening.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.400 align:middle line:84%
For those that don't really
understand exactly what that

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.247 align:middle line:84%
might mean for them, you speak
about three kinds of awakening.

00:46:38.247 --> 00:46:40.247 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You've done
your research very well.

00:46:40.247 --> 00:46:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Can you-- can you--

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Can you share with our viewers?

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.547 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah, we can cover
awakening a couple of ways.

00:46:47.547 --> 00:46:49.000 align:middle line:84%
One is what you've
just described,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.800 align:middle line:90%
the three kinds of awakening.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Most people are familiar--
you go to bed at night.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.160 align:middle line:90%
They sleep.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:90%
They dream.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.470 align:middle line:90%
They wake up.

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's familiar with
that kind of awakening.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:03.190 align:middle line:84%
The next level awakening is
when you leave your body,

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and you realize the
body-- you're alive

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.300 align:middle line:90%
independent of the body.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:10.840 align:middle line:84%
That can come through lucid
dreaming, astral traveling.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.850 align:middle line:84%
People have near-death
experiences.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.470 align:middle line:84%
People have traumatic
things happen,

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they're looking
at the doctor operate on them,

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:19.960 align:middle line:90%
but they're not there.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.857 align:middle line:90%
They're on the ceiling, looking.

00:47:21.857 --> 00:47:24.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the second stage of
awakening, where you actually

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:27.370 align:middle line:84%
realize your consciousness
is independent

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:90%
of the physical body.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness uses
the body for expression.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And the third state of
awakening is when you actually

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.480 align:middle line:84%
have the awareness that you are
one with God, one with life,

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:90%
one with the presence.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.910 align:middle line:84%
That sense of separation
has dissolved.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And you realize the universe
has said tag, you're it.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.240 align:middle line:90%
You're in the presence.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So those are three
stages of awakening.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Now awakening occurs
when we realize--

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.520 align:middle line:90%
no, we are awareness itself.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't
just have awareness.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.080 align:middle line:90%
We are awareness.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And our body temple
is in our awareness.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.360 align:middle line:84%
This building is
in our awareness.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.500 align:middle line:84%
We are in each
other's awareness.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.030 align:middle line:90%
And I like to say that--

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:21.010 align:middle line:84%
this is an analogy-- you
have the ocean, pure H2O.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.503 align:middle line:84%
Then there's content
in that ocean.

00:48:22.503 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:90%
There's things in the ocean.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:24.470 align:middle line:90%
There's boats.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:25.290 align:middle line:90%
There's pollution.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.740 align:middle line:90%
There's all kinds of stuff.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But that stuff that's in
the ocean is not the ocean.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.420 align:middle line:90%
It's stuff that's in the ocean.

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So the stuff that's
in us is not us.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.990 align:middle line:90%
It's just in us.

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.430 align:middle line:90%
It's in our awareness.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Now every time we're
able to have an insight,

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:43.290 align:middle line:84%
we realize that that content is
not us, but we're watching it.

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:44.840 align:middle line:90%
That's awakening.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.200 align:middle line:84%
The average person actually
thinks that they are sad,

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.880 align:middle line:84%
or they actually think that
experience that they had,

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.440 align:middle line:90%
that's who they are.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.360 align:middle line:90%
No, that's content.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.890 align:middle line:90%
That's not who you are.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Who you are is the
person looking at it.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And so through
meditation, through

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.370 align:middle line:84%
different spiritual
practices, you're

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:04.800 align:middle line:84%
able to little by
little by little

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.510 align:middle line:84%
see, oh, that's content
passing through.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not who I am.

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:09.420 align:middle line:90%
And now you're waking up.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm-hmm.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.270 align:middle line:84%
What if someone is watching that
is facing this idea of death

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:19.980 align:middle line:84%
in their life, their own life,
in their family, a loved one?

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.740 align:middle line:84%
How do they translate
that into the circuitry

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.900 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
raised in, thinking

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that this is an imminent
thing that is not good,

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and I do not know
how to deal with it?

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.888 align:middle line:84%
What can we just
offer our viewers?

00:49:34.888 --> 00:49:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: You know, all
the mystical teachings,

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.555 align:middle line:84%
whether you go through
the Tibetan book

00:49:38.555 --> 00:49:41.370 align:middle line:84%
of the dead, different
mystical teachings

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:46.140 align:middle line:84%
of the teachings of the
Christ, or whatever it is.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.420 align:middle line:84%
If it's a path with
heart, it ultimately

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:54.210 align:middle line:84%
bumps into the awareness that
we have a temporary expression

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:57.310 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, but we never die.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:84%
That this life that we are, this
awareness, this distinct unit

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.713 align:middle line:84%
of energy called us,
it doesn't suffer birth

00:50:08.713 --> 00:50:09.880 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't suffer death.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It continues to unfold.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Now because of how
we've been taught,

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and because we're so body
conscious that we actually

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:22.970 align:middle line:84%
think that this is who we
are, that we become very, very

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:26.570 align:middle line:84%
frightened when it's time
to cross that divide.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:84%
What we want to
begin to do, we want

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:34.520 align:middle line:84%
to begin to have seeped into
the awareness of our culture,

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.150 align:middle line:84%
not just at the mystical level,
but at the regular level--

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.530 align:middle line:90%
this is a pass through.

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:43.580 align:middle line:90%
We're coming to pass.

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.660 align:middle line:90%
We're coming.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And so during the
time we have here,

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.350 align:middle line:84%
this parenthesis
that we have, we

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.980 align:middle line:84%
want to share and give and
love, and bring back, bring out

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.680 align:middle line:84%
our gifts, because the only
thing that people are going

00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:00.300 align:middle line:84%
to be upset about is the
unrealized potential, the gifts

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.210 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't give, the
things that they didn't go

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:06.330 align:middle line:84%
for, because they were afraid,
the closing of the heart

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:09.770 align:middle line:90%
and not loving, not sharing.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.380 align:middle line:84%
You want to be more
frightened of that

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:15.020 align:middle line:84%
than the demise
of a body temple.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when you cross
over and look back--

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and I've been on the
other side many times--

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.770 align:middle line:84%
you cross back and
look back, you're

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:24.320 align:middle line:84%
going to be very
upset at yourself

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.870 align:middle line:84%
of the love you didn't share,
the gifts you didn't give,

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.610 align:middle line:90%
the activation of potential.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.120 align:middle line:90%
That's frightening to the soul.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But the releasing
of a body temple?

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Not so much.

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Not so much.

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:39.252 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we have
tremendous compassion

00:51:39.252 --> 00:51:41.210 align:middle line:84%
on ourselves and on people
who lose loved ones.

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're with somebody
20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years,

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:46.040 align:middle line:90%
sadness is there.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:46.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't deny that.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.090 align:middle line:90%
We don't deny the sadness.

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:49.380 align:middle line:90%
We embrace it.

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.255 align:middle line:84%
You know, we deny the
fact that we're missing

00:51:51.255 --> 00:51:52.840 align:middle line:90%
somebody-- we embrace it.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.718 align:middle line:84%
But as far as death itself,
it doesn't have any power.

00:51:56.718 --> 00:51:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It doesn't happen.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.968 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: It doesn't exist.

00:51:58.968 --> 00:52:01.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, as the Native
Americans tell us,

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a word for death
in one particular tribe,

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.155 align:middle line:84%
and it means not
here, somewhere else.

00:52:07.155 --> 00:52:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a literal translation.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: They're not
here right now.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:10.598 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: They're not here.

00:52:10.598 --> 00:52:11.673 align:middle line:90%
They're somewhere else.

00:52:11.673 --> 00:52:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Because we know that.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.890 align:middle line:84%
We just weave into
another grand adventure.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And the key is for
us to be able to wrap

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.550 align:middle line:84%
our minds around
that whole picture,

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:24.430 align:middle line:84%
so that we're not afraid of
any aspect of the whole process

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:25.380 align:middle line:90%
of passing through.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Absolutely.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Embrace your grieving.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Embrace the sadness.

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Embrace the missing.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to chemicalize
it away, or have

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:34.747 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of
compulsive behaviors

00:52:34.747 --> 00:52:36.830 align:middle line:84%
that are going to take you
away from feeling that.

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.568 align:middle line:84%
In our culture,
they do that a lot.

00:52:38.568 --> 00:52:40.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
irregular sadness,

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and they want to give you a
pill so you're not being sad.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.260 align:middle line:84%
No, no, you're
supposed to be sad.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're supposed
to feel it all.

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: If your
best friend just

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:49.770 align:middle line:84%
died, you're supposed
to feel sad, you know?

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.240 align:middle line:90%
So you don't take something to--

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.740 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Be with your sadness.

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Walk through it.

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:56.685 align:middle line:84%
Have somebody walk
through it with you.

00:52:56.685 --> 00:52:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You're guiding people in
such beautiful, beautiful ways.

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:02.070 align:middle line:10%
I know that your book,
"Life Visioning,"

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:07.320 align:middle line:10%
is an amazing process of guiding
people in this sort of way,

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.780 align:middle line:10%
putting a structure to
visioning for their lives.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Can you share anything
about the book

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that might help our
viewers understand

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:16.230 align:middle line:90%
what they might grieve?

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: This
particular piece is--

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:20.090 align:middle line:90%
this is how I started Agape.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I actually used a life visioning
process to begin Agape.

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of our particular
departments in our community

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.680 align:middle line:84%
have a visioning
staff, where they meet

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and actually vision as to
what's trying to emerge next.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So in this book
carries the four stages

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual growth development
that we talked about,

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:40.590 align:middle line:84%
visualization being
part of stage two,

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:42.300 align:middle line:84%
visioning being a
part of stage three.

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.130 align:middle line:90%
It covers all of that.

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot of material
in that book about how

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:48.390 align:middle line:90%
to practice it.

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Because individuals can
have theory all day long.

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.450 align:middle line:10%
But unless they actually
sit down and do the practice

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.160 align:middle line:10%
and integrate, it's just
going to be memorization,

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.920 align:middle line:10%
and then that causes
stagnation, and then

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.980 align:middle line:10%
that causes spiritual
constipation.

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's a book
of how to practice it.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:08.845 align:middle line:84%
And it's been out for a
while, but people love.

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:10.120 align:middle line:90%
It keeps on selling.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's a beautiful book.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.655 align:middle line:84%
And also, you have
a new small book

00:54:14.655 --> 00:54:16.280 align:middle line:84%
out for people who
might be interested.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah, I have a book
called "Prosperity, Plenitude,

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.370 align:middle line:90%
and Infinite Possibilities."

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:22.650 align:middle line:84%
It just came out a
couple of weeks ago.

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:25.700 align:middle line:10%
It was a companion
piece to an online class

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:29.670 align:middle line:10%
that people can sign up for at
Agapelive.com of the same name.

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And so you can take
the class online,

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and then you can get
the book, because it

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.170 align:middle line:90%
carries other material as well.

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm-hmm.

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Reverend Michael, you
are an amazing individual

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:40.630 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.950 align:middle line:84%
It is a great joy to be
with you every moment

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that I get to be with you.

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.120 align:middle line:84%
When I met you, I
instantly knew that you

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.640 align:middle line:84%
were a brother from
beyond, and we've

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.100 align:middle line:84%
had much, much fun
dancing in the ethers

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.360 align:middle line:90%
together over the years.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And it is so
wonderful to have you

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.710 align:middle line:84%
here on the "Healing
Matrix," sharing

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:03.435 align:middle line:84%
your infinite wisdom and your
huge, huge, cosmic heart.

00:55:03.435 --> 00:55:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Sue Morter,
thank you so much.

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.270 align:middle line:84%
You're one of my favorite
people on the whole planet.

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:11.440 align:middle line:90%
You say come, I'm coming.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.742 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we recognize each
other from that moment.

00:55:14.742 --> 00:55:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: People were
trying to get us

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.220 align:middle line:90%
to meet each other for years.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: For years, I know.

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: We sat down, and boom.

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:20.825 align:middle line:90%
>>BECKWITH: Oh, you're her.

00:55:20.825 --> 00:55:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Oh it's-- I get it.

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:22.400 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.108 align:middle line:84%
>>BECKWITH: Yeah, I
talk about you a lot,

00:55:24.108 --> 00:55:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and you do great work.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm just glad that we're
friends and colleagues.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great
part of my life.

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, so
much more to come.

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.310 align:middle line:84%
If you are in
sickness or in health,

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:39.040 align:middle line:84%
we can all apply Reverend
Michael's wisdom to our lives.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We can detox with forgiveness,
heal the heart with gratitude,

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and awaken to our
greatest potential,

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.000 align:middle line:90%
because the answer is us.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us on "Healing Matrix."

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:57.000 align:middle line:90%
