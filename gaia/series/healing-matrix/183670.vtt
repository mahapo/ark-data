00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.197 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:10%
>> We've all heard about the
dangers we face as a result

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:10%
of contaminating
our environment.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:10%
We know about air
pollution and chemicals

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:10%
in our food and water.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:84%
But what if there are
other forces that impact

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:90%
the quality of our health?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Forces that we cannot
see with the naked eye?

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ibrahim Karim,
founder of biogeometry,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and the managing
director of his company,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
who also happens to be his
daughter, Doreya Karim,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
are with us today to discuss
a revolutionary science

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and design language
known as biogeometry.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Karim, Doreya.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So excited to get into
this conversation.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:90%
It is fascinating.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating information.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell us a little
bit about yourself, Dr. Karim?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Your history, where
you're from, what

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.055 align:middle line:84%
happened to begin this
process in your life?

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm an
Egyptian born in Egypt.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And I went to study
in Switzerland.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I studied architecture
in Zurich,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and specialized in
tourist planning.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:10%
And then I went back
to Egypt, worked

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:10%
at university and consulting
different ministries

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:10%
like health, culture,
scientific research.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And while I was in
Egypt, I got introduced

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
to some of the ancient
Egyptian sciences,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
which made me want to know
more about the relationship

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
between ancient
Egyptian monuments

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of
the environment,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and how it affected people, and
the healing effects about it.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's what got my
interest in the beginning.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And what led you to the
information that specifically

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
generated what you've
developed, called biogeometry?

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I was working as
consultant to the minister

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:10%
of health, and one of my
projects was the restoration

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:10%
of the Museum of ancient
Egyptian medicine.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:10%
And there, I met two doctors
who were working there

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:10%
and I wanted to know
more about the energy

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Egyptian medicine.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know some
scientific aspects about it.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And then they told me
about a group in France

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
who for some years
worked on this aspect.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But their work has
gone into oblivion.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Somehow, it got lost.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me the
names of a few books.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, next day,
the minister tells me,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Ibrahim, you have
to go to France

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to sign a treaty with the
Ministry of Health Affairs.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So I go to Paris and
finish this thing.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Next day, I was on
the plane to Paris,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and then I thought, OK,
I'll go to the center

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:90%
where the books are.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.935 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the center and I
finished my work in four days.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to the
center, strange things

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:90%
happened from the first day.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
The very old lady who
was running the center,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
I asked for the books,
and they told me,

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:90%
where did you get those names?

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't exist,
those names, anymore.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:90%
I told them, from Egypt.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And they told me,
did you visit Egypt?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, I'm an Egyptian.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I come from there.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So the old lady who was sitting
there said, my son, come here.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And told the people there
to go in the cellar.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a room
that full of books.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.862 align:middle line:84%
They should bring
out all the books.

00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And then she told
me, look, there's

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
a group here for studying
the physics of energy.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And they used geometrical
ships from Egypt.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
harmful emanation

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that led to the
death of one of them.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So this science was put aside,
because it couldn't handle

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:90%
the dangerous Egyptian shapes.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Now the science was lost.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And it is for an Egyptian
and then engineer like you

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:90%
to revise it.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
revise to revive it.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But take care, my son, of the
harmful energy aspects in this.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you'll
find a solution to that.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I took all those books
and then she told me

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
all those books are a present.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I took back full of books, and
I kept reading day and night

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
about the energies
of geometrical shapes

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
as they were in ancient Egypt.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I managed to find where the
harm is and how to avoid it.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.955 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to the first
steps into biogeometry.

00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> This is fascinating
information.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrilled to hear about this.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely love ancient
Egyptian technology.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we get
to have this conversation

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:90%
thrills me today.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so looking
forward to digging

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
into what you've
found about working

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
with these shapes
and these geometries,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and sharing that
with our audience.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
First, Doreya, please tell us a
little bit about yourself, too.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:84%
This must be fascinating
living inside of this world,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
growing up inside
of it, et cetera.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so you nailed
it right on the head.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in this world.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.600 align:middle line:10%
so I'm the youngest of four
kids and by the time I was born,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:10%
biogeometry was well on its way.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing about growing
up in this is a lot of people

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
go through their formal
school education,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and then they come and try to
look at this world of energy

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.567 align:middle line:84%
So imagine where basically,
you're going to school

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and learning about this
stuff and then going

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
home, and getting, I guess, the
holistic energy aspect of it.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
neat because I don't

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
have to try to marry two
different world views.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:90%
To me, they're one in the same.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.945 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the world view.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a world view.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:90%
It's two sides of the same coin.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So like in second grade, I
was doing an entrance exam

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.620 align:middle line:84%
after moving back
from Florida to Egypt.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.075 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote about my geometry.

00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And I went home
my mom, was like,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:84%
no school is going to take
this girl after that paper.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what I wrote.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.965 align:middle line:84%
And then they actually
skipped me a grade.

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in my
school system, it

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:84%
was encouraged to think in
this way, versus there was

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:90%
no kind of clashing worldviews.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, so I graduated
with a psychology

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:90%
degree and graphic design.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I continued to work
with my father.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.873 align:middle line:84%
And also finished my
consulting as a biologist.

00:07:04.873 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
working with him now

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:90%
for about 10 years formally.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.265 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I grew
up with this and--

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, just to let you guys
know I grew up in a household

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that was all about
energy medicine.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:90%
My father was a pioneer.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I worked with him
for many years.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:10%
He's no longer with
us, but I completely

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:10%
resonate with what your dynamic
is, and the fact that you're

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:10%
both in this pioneering state
of mind, and as a way of living.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thrilled to dig in.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do that.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Let us share with everyone
what is biogeometry--

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:84%
two words that people don't
normally hear stuck together.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:90%
So talk to us.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Biogeometry, let's
stick where we left off

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
with the French system,
with all the danger that

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
was in those energies
of Egyptian shapes.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I had to find
something that would

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
take them forward and make
them useful instead of harmful.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And that came out of
the energy that we've

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
see in earth power spots,
healing energies out

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the science called
biogeometry is three things.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Geo means earth.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Metry is the measurement
of the Earth,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is how the ancient
Egyptians surveyed the earth

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:84%
to redefine their fields
after the flood every year.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Now bio is the life
energy of the Earth.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So biogeometry means
measurements of the life energy

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just
making measurements,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:84%
you are measuring the
life of the Earth being

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.385 align:middle line:90%
of which we are a part.

00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, So the life force of
this environment, this world,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.265 align:middle line:90%
this space that we're in.

00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And we define it as by
geometry is it design language

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
that introduces a
balance of effects,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
some qualities into the subtle
energy of the environment.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:90%
The definition of biogeometry.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's think of
this design language.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Just break those words
down for our audience

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:90%
so that they can follow along.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.665 align:middle line:84%
What this means,
design language.

00:09:27.665 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Design language means
using geometrical shapes.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Shapes.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, as a way of connecting,
as a way of furthering energy

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:90%
flow.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but to make
it very simple.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
We've all studied that
if you have a glass

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
prism and light goes
through it, then

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:84%
it will split into
all different colors.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Now colors are qualities.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And each one has
a different angle.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that
angles are also qualities.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Now if angles are
qualities, and angles

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:84%
are the components of shape,
so shapes are frozen qualities.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So this puts you on the
first step of a design language

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
of shape that interacts
with qualities,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:90%
because shape is quality.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We call it nature's
own design language.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:90%
We like to use that term.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
at the world and how

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:84%
we communicate with
our environment,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
you would look at our sensory
experiences or perceptions.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's shape, color,
sound, smell, touch, taste.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is, is
when you can actually

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:84%
understand how these
shapes have a subtle energy

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
pattern behind them,
then you can actually

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand how
they shape our environment.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And how these shapes shape
our environment in turn

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is how our
environment shapes us.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can understand
the pattern or the language

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
behind it, then
what it allows you

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to do-- that's why we call
it a design language--

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
is it allows you to shape your
built environment, to shape

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:90%
any product you design.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
To shape anything
from furniture to rugs

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:84%
to even products of
modern technology.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.435 align:middle line:84%
You can bring in a
balancing quality to them.

00:11:18.435 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything is energy
vibrating at different

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
You're managing
these frequencies

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
by the shapes, the containers
the environment is being

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
exposed to, thereby having an
influence on the environment

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
with structures that
you are creating

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:90%
for the purpose of doing so.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.765 align:middle line:90%
Am I on it?

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> In English, the word shape
leads us to think of the shape

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But in other
language, I would use

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:84%
the word form, because form is
a process, is a forming process.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So at the end, the
resulting form,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.215 align:middle line:84%
it means it's a whole
evolution of shape.

00:12:01.215 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's evolving.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.606 align:middle line:90%
>> It's evolving.

00:12:02.606 --> 00:12:04.023 align:middle line:84%
>> It's changing,
It's developing.

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so I like to use the
word form instead of shape,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:84%
because it means a complete
forming process of things.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you speak
of form, that means

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:84%
you are speaking on
all energy levels--

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
vitality, emotional,
mental, spiritual.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:84%
All those are part
of the qualities that

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:90%
are in the evolution of form.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.663 align:middle line:90%
They are the life qualities.

00:12:29.663 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> A good example
of this I think,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
that you also always
use, is if you look

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.770 align:middle line:90%
at an architect's job--

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:84%
you're going to an architect
to design a house for you.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.465 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of
designing this house

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:90%
is for you to live in.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you go down to
the first questions,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:84%
you would expect an
architect to ask,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:90%
how many bedrooms you need.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, did you want
an open concept.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Or questions like that.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But we say if you're going
to be living in this house,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
then what the first question
the architect should ask you

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
is, what are the qualities
of life that matter to you?

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Should you be able to
talk with the architect

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.410 align:middle line:84%
about the emotional energy of
the house they're designing?

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I want it to feel relaxing.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I want it feel
stimulating and active.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.355 align:middle line:84%
In this room, we
want to be bright,

00:13:17.355 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and thinking, and creative.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And in this room, we want
to chill out, and not have

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:90%
to think, and then be nurtured.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, supported, nurtured.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And so actually, going back to
that, one of the first articles

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that came out from New York and
ran in magazine on my geometry,

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:90%
it was titled, "Calm."

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it was titled
"Calm," was it was actually,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:84%
the editor into that
apartment and he

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
said that it's the first time
he saw his camera man calm.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, so I know how
I'm going to explain this,

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:90%
that he is now calm.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.865 align:middle line:90%
And that was the title.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So this influences
how energies flow,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
the experience
that we then have.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And where we're headed
into this conversation

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
is the application of
this for someone's health,

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
their vitality, their
emotional state,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:84%
psychological well-being,
based upon what

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
we're doing with the
shape of moving energies

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
in certain patterns to develop
a form that is more enhancing.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So I like to define
architecture for an architect

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:90%
as a sculpture of space.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't live in the
walls, you live in the space.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So a sculpture of space
means to sculpt or form

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
all the levels of that space--
vitality, emotional, mental,

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.475 align:middle line:84%
So the job of an architect
is sculpture of space.

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Is to create the
space, a sacred space.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Sacred space, yes.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So what does biogeometry
have to do specifically

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:90%
with health and healing?

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
How can we get right
into that conversation.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.675 align:middle line:84%
So that people can
begin to immediately see

00:14:56.675 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:84%
the brilliance behind
this and how it's going

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.845 align:middle line:90%
to affect them in the moment?

00:15:01.845 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, like we said,
biogeometry is the life energy

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So now today, the
biggest problem

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that you have in healing
is that modern medicine

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:84%
is advancing so much and has
found cures to so many things.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to chronic diseases,

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:90%
there, we have a problem.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Modern medicine can only
managed this ever-growing field

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
of disease because it cannot
find the cause of those

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:90%
diseases.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Now the problem is because
the cause is somewhere else.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:84%
The cause is out there
in the environment.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So biogeometry,
if you're looking

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
at the Earth as a living
environmental system.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So we should look at the cause
of chronic diseases in problems

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:84%
out there in that
environmental system.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Sickness exists there, that's
why you have chronic diseases.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And so biogeometry takes
to think in a holistic way.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.835 align:middle line:84%
It takes you and the
environment as one.

00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>> As one.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And then correcting
one and the other.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
If you correct just
the body, isn't enough.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Connect just the
environment, isn't enough.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But correct the holistic
relationship between both,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:84%
that's our definition
of healing--

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.345 align:middle line:84%
of how geometry
leads to healing.

00:16:25.345 --> 00:16:28.762 align:middle line:84%
>> A really good
example I can tell.

00:16:28.762 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:90%
I always remember this.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So he, as a professor
of architecture as well,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.240 align:middle line:84%
was supervising a
biogeometry thesis.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so to cut a long
story short, in this thesis,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
it was a student who was
studying the effects of shapes

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:84%
for designing a center for
people who are recovering

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
from addiction and depression.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And so once you presented the
thesis to my father, he said,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
well, we need some
testing here, and we

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
need some experiments
for this to be complete.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And so he told her, you
need to take your design

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.986 align:middle line:84%
to the medical department
of the university.

00:17:05.986 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:84%
So of course, the medical
department picked up the phone

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and said, stop sending
us your design students.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer
was really good where

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:21.428 align:middle line:84%
I heard him say, I will stop
sending you my design students

00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:90%
when they stop showing results.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.424 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.424 --> 00:17:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not stopping.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And until then, why can't you
consider that the way we design

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
our homes could actually be a
form of preventative medicine?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, why can't I ask
the medical team to evaluate

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
different houses and
different spaces for me?

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I go in there,
please, diagnose me.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I go in there, please
diagnose me and tell me

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:90%
where am I getting better.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So when I send you
architecture projects,

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:84%
you have to acknowledge
and measure.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was strange asking from
a professor of architecture

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:90%
to the Department of Medicine.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you're asking
him quite a stretch here.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:84%
It's quite a stretch,
because number one--

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:90%
But

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.015 align:middle line:90%
>> This is where we live.

00:18:10.015 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
They're used to
looking at things

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.492 align:middle line:90%
from a symptomatic approach.

00:18:13.492 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:90%
How do we treat the symptoms.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're saying there's a
cause underneath the symptom.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And not only is
there a cause, it

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:84%
could be that there's something
outside the human system that

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:90%
is directly influencing it.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So you want to address
it from this outside

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.317 align:middle line:90%
in and from the inside out.

00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And they probably
didn't have any idea

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.067 align:middle line:90%
what you were talking about.

00:18:33.067 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to force
them also to look--

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.135 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to force medicine
to look at the environment.

00:18:37.135 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Big stretch and
thank you for asking.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for asking.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So I have to ask,
what's the relationship

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
between biogeometry
and sacred geometry?

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
How does that fit
into your context?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, sacred geometry started
with the proportion of one

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:90%
to 1.618.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
the golden mean,

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%
because people got interested
in a proportion that was

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:90%
a sort of evolution, you know?

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Divide the line,
the smallest part

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
of the larger part
equal to the largest

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:84%
part of the sum of both,
and so on, and so on, so on.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So you could actually design
evolutionary systems that were

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:90%
connected by one relationship.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So they took that as a
relationship of beauty.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And sacred geometry started
developing different patterns

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:90%
based on that proportion.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they looked at
ancient architecture,

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and found that
that proportion was

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:90%
used in ancient architecture.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Now biogeometry
goes a bit further.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to cite
a Swiss in the 1940s

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:90%
called Johann Kaiser.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
He revived the ancient
sciences of musical harmonics

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that extend beyond music to
cover everything in nature so

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that everything was in
resonance, everything in nature

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:84%
was according to a
certain proportion,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:84%
musical proportions,
and all that.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said that why
should architects today

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:25.105 align:middle line:84%
think that they can build
a symphony with one note?

00:20:25.105 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
That means with one
proportion, when

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:84%
the ancients said that
architecture was frozen music.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:90%
So it goes beyond that.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Now biogeometry is not only
interested in the proportions

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
of harmony and beauty.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Biogeometry reproduces
the healing energy quality

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:84%
So it is more geared
at quality that you

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
can get to through a science
of design, being in proportion,

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:84%
being good just form,
being principles of design.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Many ways.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's a quality.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the state that we want
to achieve, a holistic healing

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:90%
That's biogeometry.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not something to make
beautiful designs of things

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.935 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:21:20.935 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So the word might seem
new, but this is just really

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:84%
bridging into our ancient
ancestral heritage, right?

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.590 align:middle line:84%
This is as deep ancient
stuff that you're

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:90%
bringing forward and bridging.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
These people handed you these
pieces of information in France

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
about these ancient
technologies,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're weaving it together
in an applicable fashion.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Because of evolution,
you're able to look

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:84%
at those old things and
give given modern day

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
application that is a healing
modality for us today.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, the cornerstone
of biogeometry is the healing

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:90%
energy of the Earth.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Because we are bacteria
in the body of the Earth.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:90%
We don't live on the earth.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
We live in the earth
because the atmosphere

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
is part of the Earth.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So acknowledging this
energy, and if the Earth

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
has healing energies, then why
not use those healing energies

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:84%
in all our designs in order
to continue with the healing

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:90%
energy of design?

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So the cornerstone
of biogeometry

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
is actually the
healing energies we

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:84%
find in certain spots
in the earth that

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:90%
are called sacred power spots.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:84%
This healing energy-- and
many people do not know today,

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
but one of the most
important factors

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
in the evolution of the
history of humanity in general,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.470 align:middle line:84%
even until today,
is the power spot.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Rituals, religions,
wars, everything

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:90%
has to do with power spots.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Ancient city
planning, everything

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.645 align:middle line:90%
has to do with the power spot.

00:23:11.645 --> 00:23:14.455 align:middle line:10%
>> Rome, Washington, Cairo.

00:23:14.455 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> All those have their
power spots, their obelisks.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So it played a huge
role in history.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was a main aspect
in ancient civilization,

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:90%
ancient scientists.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And today, it is
completely forgotten.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So we are losing your
relationship with power spots,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
meaning losing your
relationships with the Earth.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Ending up with us
destroying the environment.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because we
are out of touch.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So just to recap, there
are spots in the earth,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:84%
vortices of energy, or energies
that are emitting that are

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:90%
of a unique quality.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Temples, political
affiliations, all kinds

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
of powerful
enhancements have been

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:84%
built around or upon these
spots because of the energies

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.160 align:middle line:90%
that they emit.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And what you are doing is
saying let's get back in touch

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
with that same energy that
was so powerful, that it

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:84%
led to where the ancient
architectures were

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:90%
built in the first place.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's tap that ourselves and
not let it be lost forever.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's regain, reclaim.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That is beautiful.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And the thing about
this sacred power spots,

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
why we keep focusing on them
so much and talking about

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:84%
the healing energy of the
Earth, is looking at it--

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not a medical doctor,
he's not a medical doctor.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And even though we understand
a lot about how the body works,

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.723 align:middle line:84%
one thing is a lot of
energy practices today,

00:24:42.723 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:84%
whether you're an alternative
medicine or mainstream

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:84%
medicine, they function
by diagnosing you.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I have to look at you and I have
to find out what's overactive,

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and I have to find out
what's under active,

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and give you the opposite
energy quality in simpler terms.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.015 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.015 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the work
of French [INAUDIBLE] did,

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that work that he inherited
from France actually allowed him

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you now go and look
at this architect inheriting

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:84%
all of this information
on the health of the body,

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
body in ancient Egypt,

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and all of these things,
there was one thing--

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and this was kind of that
parallel thinking that

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
was the birth of my
biogeometry, is, is there

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
an energy that I
can expose you to,

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
no matter if that organ is
under active or overactive,

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:90%
and it would balance that organ?

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly, it
has no dosage effect at all.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So no side effects,
no interactions.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
sacred power spot does.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.045 align:middle line:84%
It's a naturally
occurring energy.

00:25:51.045 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Harmonizes.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That will harmonize
no matter the problem.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to add
something here.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:84%
That in any form
of energy medicine,

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
it's almost the world
of duality is imbalance

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
balance, that you

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.900 align:middle line:84%
have to have a certain dosage
in order to balance that.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But in power spots, in
ancient temples and all that,

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.490 align:middle line:84%
you could go and
stay in dish forever.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.372 align:middle line:84%
And over function
will be balanced,

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and under function will be
balanced at the same time.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:90%
And you can stay there forever.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's a state.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.625 align:middle line:84%
It's not a balancing thing,
it's a permanent thing.

00:26:32.625 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not a compensation.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.077 align:middle line:84%
We're not compensating
for something.

00:26:35.077 --> 00:26:36.119 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not compensation.

00:26:36.119 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So actually, what we are doing
here, instead of using our mind

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:46.260 align:middle line:84%
to look at dosage, we are
taking you back to Mother Earth,

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and you connect with Mother
Earth, who will actually

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.545 align:middle line:90%
bring you back into shape.

00:26:51.545 --> 00:26:52.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:52.345 --> 00:26:53.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Not me, Mother Earth.

00:26:53.842 --> 00:26:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> We call it centering.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
You're at you're not on
the opposite side where

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:90%
there is polarities.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
You're right at the--

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.915 align:middle line:84%
culmination takes
care of itself.

00:27:02.915 --> 00:27:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> My biggest title is not
my PhD or doctor's degree.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, my biggest title is
that now I'm a doorman.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.572 align:middle line:84%
I open the door for the
Earth's energy to come out,

00:27:11.572 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and it does everything.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> The world's greatest doorman.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, I gather.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.460 align:middle line:84%
The science of geometry is
Dr. Karim's modern application

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:90%
of ancient technology.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
geometry of the Giza Pyramids

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.440 align:middle line:90%
and see what it has to show us.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.470 align:middle line:10%
>> If the ancient texts from
both Sumerian cuneiforms

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:10%
and Egyptian books suggest
the Great Pyramid as a place

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.460 align:middle line:10%
to resurrect the dead, could
there be another hidden

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.785 align:middle line:10%
message?

00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an ancient code
to be found within the Great

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:10%
It's within the geometry, not
just of the pyramid itself,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:10%
but its relationship to
the other two main pyramids

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:10%
of the Giza Plateau.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:10%
Having studied this
for a number of years,

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.260 align:middle line:10%
it seems to be related
very much to do

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:10%
with the idea of the
music of the spheres.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.640 align:middle line:10%
The idea that there is
some kind of connection

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.230 align:middle line:10%
between the primal tones
of the universe itself

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:10%
and their relationship to the
creation of fold and structure

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.790 align:middle line:10%
in the physical world.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:10%
To somehow attune and
enhance this connection,

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:10%
that certain proportions
have to be constructed

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:10%
into the design of
the pyramid and also,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.140 align:middle line:10%
the geometry of the
landscape itself.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.130 align:middle line:10%
These seem to reflect
the musical intervals.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:10%
In particular, those
which are known

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.120 align:middle line:10%
as the perfect fourth,
which has the ratio of 4:3,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:10%
and those though as
the perfect fifth,

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:10%
has a ratio of 3:2,
one of which is

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:10%
an inverse form of the other.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>> How fascinating.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is a very
deep, rich, personal interest

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:08.370 align:middle line:90%
of mine.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I take people to
sacred sites around the world

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.550 align:middle line:90%
for this very reason.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a joy to see
your application of this.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I have my own
ideas, but I want

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
to hear your ideas
about what do you

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
think about the ancient
pyramid structures?

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:90%
What is happening there?

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.845 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:29:29.845 --> 00:29:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is a very
important part here,

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:84%
which has been shown individual,
about the music of the spheres.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.630 align:middle line:10%
To simplify this, if
you just take a rope

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:10%
and you swing it like
this, it divides itself

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.162 align:middle line:10%
after some time in
different proportions,

00:29:45.162 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:10%
and then it comes back.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's always the
same proportions.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients took
those proportions

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:84%
on a musical string, and
produced musical notes.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:84%
So actually, if wavelengths or
rope lengths divide themselves

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:84%
always by the same
fractions, that

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:84%
means these are the
fractions of creation,

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.800 align:middle line:84%
because vibration will
keep dividing itself.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So music here, you have
managed to decipher

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
the mind of creation
through your musical notes

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:90%
through their proportions.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Now if you used
those proportions

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:27.015 align:middle line:84%
to build your pyramids and place
your pyramids on a sacred power

00:30:27.015 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:84%
spot, now what you are doing
is connecting the energy

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:36.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth with the
energy of creation,

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:42.060 align:middle line:84%
with the whole divine mind
through the musical proportions

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.660 align:middle line:84%
of shape on the
sacred power spots.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramid
itself, what it does

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:84%
is actually connects the Earth
with power spots in the sky.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Because to the ancient
Egyptian, there

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:84%
were power spots in
the sky that played

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:84%
an important role, spiritual
power spots like Sirius,

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Sirius, Orion, those places.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramid connected
the power spot of the Earth

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.260 align:middle line:90%
with the power spots in the sky.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's connecting
several planets together

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:90%
in the planetary grid.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's producing a
spiritual planetary grid

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that it's enforcing,
anchoring it there.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.385 align:middle line:84%
>> An interdimensional
communication spot.

00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's where the soul of
the pharaoh took the solar part

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:37.815 align:middle line:84%
and went from the Earth, went
to Sirius, the spiritual abode.

00:31:37.815 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> We have so much to talk about
today, but you're coming back,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have that
conversation again, my friend.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so can we say more about
the power spots, Doreya?

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.000 align:middle line:84%
What else can you share
with us about this

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and where they are located
around the Earth, et cetera?

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.440 align:middle line:90%
In South America.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.875 align:middle line:84%
Are there multiple
locations around the globe?

00:32:00.875 --> 00:32:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, you had mentioned
already where we find temples

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and churches.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So the big thing about
many of these power spots

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.030 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of them are
already marked for us.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So big you know, temples
churches, mosques, pilgrimage

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.520 align:middle line:90%
sites, spiritual sites today.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Like we just mentioned
the pyramids.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.450 align:middle line:10%
But all over Egypt.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:24.330 align:middle line:10%
The Luxor temple, for
example, is a big one, too.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.610 align:middle line:84%
If you go to France
in Carnac, you

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:84%
have all of these
menhirs erected.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:33.720 align:middle line:90%
If you go to Stonehenge.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you look in
history, sacred power spots,

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:84%
if you looked at
ancient man, he would

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.190 align:middle line:84%
they would start by
marking these with menhirs.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Basically, these large--
think again of Stonehenge.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Large megalithic
stones that would

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:90%
amplify this energy qualities.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with the pyramids.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.440 align:middle line:84%
The biggest secret
behind the pyramids

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:90%
doesn't just lie in its shape.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:84%
It actually lies in where
that shape is placed.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people use
this pyramid shape.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And they understand that
it amplifies energy,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:84%
that it can have
healing properties.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:84%
But what they never
think about is

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.880 align:middle line:84%
if you have a shape
that amplifies energy

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's not on a power spot,
what are you amplifying?

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.370 align:middle line:84%
You may not be amplifying
something good.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And then so we talked
about these menhirs.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:84%
From the menhir, you add
mathematical proportions

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.190 align:middle line:84%
to these megalithic stones and
you get things like obelisks.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Obelisks in
Washington and Egypt,

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.300 align:middle line:90%
those are placed on power spots.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you have what
we also call like,

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:90%
dome and gate structures.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Those will be placed
on power spots.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you would have
either a pyramid encasing them

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:90%
or a hill casing them.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is what
is a sacred power spot?

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:84%
How do you know you find
the sacred power spot?

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
To us, it goes back to what we
call that centering quality.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.700 align:middle line:84%
It should bring your
whole body into balance.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And the wonderful
thing about biogeometry

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.260 align:middle line:84%
is it actually
gives you the tools

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:90%
to find power spots near you.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, there's
famous power spots.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's rituals for how
you interact with these power

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:90%
spots.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I recommend is if
you ever go to any power spot,

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:17.280 align:middle line:84%
whether you're in South
America, or Asia, or Africa,

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.139 align:middle line:84%
or here in North
America, there's

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:84%
usually very specific
rituals for how you interact

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:90%
with these power spots.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.040 align:middle line:84%
You may have a way
that you prefer

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
these power spots,

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.179 align:middle line:84%
but there's wisdom in
the rituals passed down.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:84%
And so small things like
the door you enter from.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:90%


00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest things
that I experienced when

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.620 align:middle line:90%
he took me to the pyramids.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.780 align:middle line:84%
We were doing different
energy measurements.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly, he
said, let me try something.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.969 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the whole
energy of the pyramids

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:56.400 align:middle line:84%
got amplified when we were
in that kings chamber.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what did you do?

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:03.240 align:middle line:10%
And he basically said, I
visualized those tunnels

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.490 align:middle line:10%
that we created in
the pyramids, he

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:10%
visualized that door to
the King's Chamber closed.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Tried to remove the obstructions
we did to that shape.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you got to
experience it the way

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:84%
it originally was, it was a
completely different experience

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I'm aware.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So when these power spots,
these vortices of energies,

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:84%
high concentration of
this subtle energy,

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.050 align:middle line:84%
were originally being
allocated by ancient man,

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.800 align:middle line:90%
how were they allocating them?

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.810 align:middle line:84%
What was happening that
they were able to--

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>> You said the word right now.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.610 align:middle line:90%
You said vortices.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's the magic word when
speaking about power spots.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:36:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Power spots have a sort of
a vortex like a wormhole.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And wormholes connecting
with the sky and the earth.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And what is a wormhole?

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.190 align:middle line:90%
In physics, what is a wormhole?

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Wormhole is something that
connects between two dimensions

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.720 align:middle line:90%
or two universes or two things.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It takes you from
one to the other.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So like our black
hole, that wormhole

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.410 align:middle line:90%
is connected to other universes.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So actually, when ancient men
or the first men went in there,

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.750 align:middle line:90%
they were imitating animals.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Animal used to go
there for healing.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.260 align:middle line:90%
And they went there.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And once they went in
that spot, some things

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:84%
happened that they
found themselves

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:44.010 align:middle line:84%
in connection or
intercommunicating

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:90%
with some form of higher beings.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And this made this place
very, very special,

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:55.920 align:middle line:84%
because every time they went
in that, something happened.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe exchange of knowledge,
maybe healing, maybe whatever.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.640 align:middle line:84%
But there, it was a
multi-dimensional relationship

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:84%
at the center of
the power spots.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So imagine we are now thinking
so much in our modern science

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:84%
how to connect between
different dimensions and all

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.350 align:middle line:84%
that, when the ancients
were already doing that

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.440 align:middle line:84%
just by being in a power
spot, you connected.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's this higher
connection that produces

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:90%
healing on the physical level.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So this made the power
spot a place of healing,

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.910 align:middle line:90%
a place of burial.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Because those beings
that you would see there,

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:90%
it would help the soul.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.797 align:middle line:84%
And it made it a
place of oracles.

00:37:41.797 --> 00:37:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Like in the temples in Greece,
and Delphi, and all that,

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.750 align:middle line:90%
their own power spots.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.910 align:middle line:90%
They go there to get oracles.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the wormhole
is the secret.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.492 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an effect you can see.

00:37:51.492 --> 00:37:53.700 align:middle line:10%
For example, when you ask
how would ancient man start

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.797 align:middle line:10%
allocating these, if
you look at for example,

00:37:57.797 --> 00:37:59.880 align:middle line:10%
one of the structures in
Egypt that's very famous,

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:10%
is a citadel of Cairo.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And how the site for
that was chosen is

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:84%
they actually hung up fresh
meat in many different locations

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.210 align:middle line:90%
in Cairo.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And the area where
this citadel was chosen

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:84%
was the area where one of the
places where the meat stayed

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.380 align:middle line:90%
fresh in the longest.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they would look at
things like how fast things

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.910 align:middle line:90%
spoiled like milk.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Another one-- I mean, it's not
a famous castle or anything,

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.938 align:middle line:84%
but I just thought it was
neat, I always remember it.

00:38:28.938 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
When I went to a
castle in Scotland,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.410 align:middle line:84%
there was this tree
that they had this fence

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.030 align:middle line:90%
around in the dungeon.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And the story was that to find
the location for this castle,

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.020 align:middle line:84%
there was a donkey cart
that they filled with gold.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And gold has a very
special quality.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
leave the donkey to roam.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And where he would go and
sit is where that spot

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.190 align:middle line:90%
was chosen to build the castle.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Another one is the famous church
in Zurich, the Grossmunster.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.450 align:middle line:84%
That was also where Charles
the Great was chasing a stag.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Hunting a stag.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And where that stag stopped
running and just sat down,

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:90%
they built the church on that.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This leads me to a story--
one of the stories that I like

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:90%
to say a lot.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:28.680 align:middle line:84%
In that same church in
Zurich, in the Roman times,

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.810 align:middle line:84%
two Egyptian missionaries
were preaching

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Christianity in Zurich.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Romans arrested
them, and took them

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.200 align:middle line:84%
on a place near the
rivers, and beheaded them.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Now the story goes that one
when they were beheaded,

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.380 align:middle line:84%
both of them took their
heads and their arms

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:55.020 align:middle line:84%
ran up a hill about 40 meters,
three meters high at the hill

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
like that, and then
collapsed at the top.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.210 align:middle line:90%
That's where they fell.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is where called
the Great [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:90%
built this church.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And on the door, you see the
saints carrying their heads.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Now today we know that this is
one of the most powerful power

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.210 align:middle line:84%
spots that you
have in the world.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that when they
were beheaded, their souls,

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:27.360 align:middle line:84%
once your physical
sensors are dumbed,

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.170 align:middle line:84%
then you are attracted
to the light.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So they saw the light,
carried their heads,

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and somehow managed to
run up and died there.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:42.540 align:middle line:84%
That's really the
story that I like

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.480 align:middle line:84%
to say about the sacred
power spot, but this very--

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.710 align:middle line:84%
not only because
they were Egyptians.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's fascinating that
so much of symbology and a lot

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:84%
of this in ancient Egypt, and
Osiris, and the stories there,

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:84%
as well and Isis putting the
consciousness back together

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.300 align:middle line:84%
again, is all about when we
get our mind out of the way,

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.300 align:middle line:84%
when we get our five senses
and our head out of the way,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
can be led by the.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Soul and the donkey sitting,
where the donkey sits,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and the cathedral being
built where it is built,

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.080 align:middle line:84%
for some, it might
seem like, well,

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of happenstance
and coincidental.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And the naysayer
might bite into that.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
talking about is there

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is a subtle energy that
if we are connected to it,

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.710 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't look like
coincidence or happenstance

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:41.410 align:middle line:84%
or just something
that is not reliable.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:45.300 align:middle line:84%
It looks rather quite reliable,
because we're making decisions

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.790 align:middle line:84%
based on a lot more
information than what we've

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.702 align:middle line:84%
been trained to think
about and perceive

00:41:50.702 --> 00:41:53.160 align:middle line:84%
with our five senses the way
that we're used to using them.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So you're connecting us
with that subtle reality.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing about biogeometry
I think it's good to add as well

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:84%
as we always say that when we
talk about energy or spiritual

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.690 align:middle line:84%
energy, we always
want to bridge--

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.850 align:middle line:84%
there is a term a lot of people
use and we use it as well,

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:11.970 align:middle line:84%
which is bridging--
the gap between science

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.160 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.730 align:middle line:84%
But we use it
differently in the sense

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that we say what's
the only way to bridge

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.550 align:middle line:84%
the gap between science
and spirituality?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Most people try to explain
spirituality scientifically,

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and we said, OK, but what if we
look at it a bit differently,

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and we look at what's the
best thing about science?

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's the practicality.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The technology,
there's an aspect to it

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that may be detrimental
to our health.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But there is an aspect
to it that is convenient,

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.053 align:middle line:90%
that is improving medicine.

00:42:47.053 --> 00:42:48.720 align:middle line:84%
That is there is an
aspect to it that we

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.310 align:middle line:90%
have to say is practical.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Now what about spirituality?

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.040 align:middle line:90%
What does it have?

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality does have
within it a balancing

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.020 align:middle line:90%
or harmonizing energy.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:90%
But how do we prove that?

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:90%


00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.960 align:middle line:84%
How can we stand in
front of that naysayer

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, there
is a scientific side

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.030 align:middle line:90%
to spirituality.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:15.460 align:middle line:84%
The way to do that is to use
spirituality practically.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And when we said a little
bit about my background

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and growing up, I think that's
a little bit of something

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.930 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from him that's
helped me so much in my life.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Where when you go into
this world of energy

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, and all
of these different things,

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:34.140 align:middle line:90%
it's like, where do you start?

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.250 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And you know he always
would say, concentrate

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:90%
on those who are doing good.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Solving a problem.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you're going to
guide your way to understanding

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:90%
this world.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Operate from a
place of creativity.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> When we think from our
outlook today about ancient

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Egypt or ancient
Sumeria, all that,

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:02.520 align:middle line:84%
we look at all that works
as symbolic or mythological.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.160 align:middle line:84%
In reality, they
were not like that.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Those people were
highly practical.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they wouldn't
have built a civilization

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.530 align:middle line:90%
that lasted thousands of years.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So what we call
their spirituality

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:21.360 align:middle line:84%
is actually a science that is
implemented in everyday life

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.780 align:middle line:84%
to produce this harmony
that made this civilization

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.040 align:middle line:90%
great for thousands of years.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So biogeometry is something
where you don't ask

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.420 align:middle line:90%
me to explain something to you.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.480 align:middle line:84%
No, you ask me, come
and solve my problem.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I have an environmental problem,
solve it with biogeometry.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So in biogeometry, you
tell people, ask us to do,

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.627 align:middle line:90%
not explain.

00:44:48.627 --> 00:44:49.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Demonstrate.

00:44:49.655 --> 00:44:50.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:50.455 --> 00:44:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Make it tangible.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.705 align:middle line:84%
>> And make it
helpful to others.

00:44:53.705 --> 00:44:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And going back to when we
explained that design language,

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.250 align:middle line:84%
we might be thinking, OK, so
how do you actually do that?

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.920 align:middle line:84%
That actually is the
cornerstone of biogeometry.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Is that the work that he
inherited, the French work,

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and talked about
ancient Egypt, talked

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.240 align:middle line:84%
about the effects of different
shapes of hieroglyphics

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and things from ancient
Egypt, but what it actually

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.460 align:middle line:84%
led to when he talked about,
how am I going to make it safe--

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.350 align:middle line:84%
so he said, let me
look at the place that

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.140 align:middle line:90%
is the most balancing.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
figure out how I can

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:28.760 align:middle line:84%
find the code to this
energy, how I can find it.

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.088 align:middle line:84%
And then how I can
reproduce it in shapes.

00:45:31.088 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
find it in your body

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.407 align:middle line:90%
as well naturally occurring.

00:45:35.407 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>> We're going to get into that.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to that.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:43.430 align:middle line:84%
You speak also about
geopathic stress, which

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:47.568 align:middle line:84%
is what we're going
to be remedying

00:45:47.568 --> 00:45:49.610 align:middle line:84%
with some of the things
we get to get into today.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.715 align:middle line:84%
But can you just
explain, define?

00:45:52.715 --> 00:45:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So sacred power spots-- so
there's two things that you

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:84%
find a lot with sacred power
spots in terms of being used.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So underneath the
sacred power spot,

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:06.045 align:middle line:84%
you actually have a crossing
of underground water streams.

00:46:06.045 --> 00:46:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
water streams running

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:09.800 align:middle line:84%
through the rocky
strata of the Earth.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And where they cross is we go
back to that vortex energy.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And it pushes water up, and
you get also that sacred power

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:19.040 align:middle line:90%
spot.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And another term
that you find a lot

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:23.750 align:middle line:84%
in terms of sacred
power spots being used

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:26.840 align:middle line:84%
or in terms of good energy
it would be ley lines.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So what ley lines are
is these are actually

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.470 align:middle line:84%
lines that connect
sacred power spots.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.900 align:middle line:84%
They are straight lines
connecting sacred power spots.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So ley lines are a 10%
beneficial earth energy line.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So geopathic stress is where
you would have underground water

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:90%
streams.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But depending on the direction
and the type of water

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that's crossing, you can
actually get a negative effect.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.750 align:middle line:90%
One that is harmful to the body.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is one that
you would want to avoid.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we would
call geopathic stress.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Earth radiation that is
harmful to your energy system.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And so by nature, the animals
would migrate away from these

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:10.700 align:middle line:90%
spaces.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:15.260 align:middle line:84%
The abundance of nature
as we know it would not

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.400 align:middle line:90%
be concentrated in such places.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.450 align:middle line:10%
So just like we
observe, you observe

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:10%
all of this thriving energy
in these positive beneficial

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.030 align:middle line:10%
areas.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.940 align:middle line:84%
You would find the opposite
in areas of geopathic stress.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Now there are a few exceptions.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So cats, for example, cats will
actually be able to go to areas

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.240 align:middle line:90%
where there is geopathic stress.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But they interact
with it differently

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and can correct that
energy for themselves.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But geopathic stress,
the birth of this term,

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.430 align:middle line:84%
or I guess that the father
of the body of work who

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:54.860 align:middle line:84%
started this in a scientific
manner was Gustav Von Paul.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:59.090 align:middle line:10%
And at that time in
Europe in the early 1900s,

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:10%
you had farmers who said that
they were aware of locations

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.230 align:middle line:10%
where their animals would
not be thriving, where

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:08.330 align:middle line:10%
things don't grow as easily.

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:11.217 align:middle line:10%
And they would also
attribute these places

00:48:11.217 --> 00:48:12.800 align:middle line:10%
to-- there's actually
a term that they

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.260 align:middle line:10%
would use called tree cancer.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And what Von Paul did is he
did the first systematic study

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:24.810 align:middle line:84%
where he actually went into
several towns and in Germany.

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And he mapped out
these areas where

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.820 align:middle line:84%
you have these
underground water streams.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And those were correlated by
the town to cancer locations.

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So he obviously didn't know
where the cancer patients were,

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.320 align:middle line:90%
he was followed by an official.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And he mapped them out,
and that was correlated.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.737 align:middle line:84%
So one thing is
they came and said

00:48:47.737 --> 00:48:51.260 align:middle line:84%
that the town that he chose was
the one that had the highest

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.370 align:middle line:90%
incidence of cancer.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:54.140 align:middle line:90%
So the study was skewed.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So he actually repeated
the study in the town

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.370 align:middle line:84%
with the lowest
incidence of cancer.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the Berlin
Center for Cancer Research

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:05.930 align:middle line:90%
published his work in 1960.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> In general, most of those
works have shown that about 80%

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:21.290 align:middle line:84%
of the cancers are found
on 10% of the area.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.260 align:middle line:90%
That means it's location linked.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.580 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.225 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all right there, right?

00:49:29.225 --> 00:49:30.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:30.025 --> 00:49:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you can move
a bed by maybe three feet

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and the person's life changes
from reoccuring cancer

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.710 align:middle line:90%
to complete healing.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.825 align:middle line:84%
>> So now of course,
everyone's wondering, oh no,

00:49:43.825 --> 00:49:45.950 align:middle line:84%
what if my bed's in the
wrong place, how do I know?

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.940 align:middle line:84%
What if I'm living near one
of these spots, what do I do?

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a consideration
that we have to speak to.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.360 align:middle line:84%
How do we keep people
calm, keep them

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.850 align:middle line:84%
from running around and
being afraid that they're

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.920 align:middle line:84%
in a negative environment
that's causing--

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we have simple solutions
in biogeometry to address that

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.263 align:middle line:90%
that we call home kits.

00:50:08.263 --> 00:50:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I look forward to
plugging into that.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I know people are
going to want to know.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.070 align:middle line:90%
They're perking up.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So for decades, scientists
have studied and utilized

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:20.270 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic energy.

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:22.600 align:middle line:90%
But what about subtle energy?

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a powerful
but mysterious force

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.980 align:middle line:84%
that impacts our
bodies, our planet,

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.870 align:middle line:90%
and the entire universe.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.850 align:middle line:10%
>> What is the difference
between the electric force

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:35.815 align:middle line:10%
and the subtle force?

00:50:35.815 --> 00:50:38.980 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's good to make the
distinction here when we talk

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:44.460 align:middle line:10%
about what's working at a
particular scale, at our scale,

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.940 align:middle line:10%
the signaling is
the same as gravity.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a subtle force.

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It's one that no one has
been able to measure.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.240 align:middle line:10%
And yet we seem to know that
it's there, the phenomena that

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.540 align:middle line:10%
have been discovered.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:10%
And the effect of
interference with that field

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:03.963 align:middle line:10%
have been tested, and
it's known that it works.

00:51:03.963 --> 00:51:05.380 align:middle line:10%
The problem is
that there has been

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:10.630 align:middle line:10%
no understanding of the physical
nature of what's going on.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.910 align:middle line:10%
So the biological field
is a subtle thing.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.100 align:middle line:10%
It's not like plasma directions,
which are electrical.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.800 align:middle line:10%
The electric force is far
more powerful than gravity.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.780 align:middle line:10%
And so electromagnetism
is far more

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.790 align:middle line:10%
powerful than the signaling
system used in biology.

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:28.320 align:middle line:10%
However, it does raise the
issue that the actual activity

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.500 align:middle line:10%
inside the cells in
the body is electrical.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.810 align:middle line:10%
So even though this
subtle signaling

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.620 align:middle line:10%
can be a control
mechanism, it is

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.160 align:middle line:10%
possible to understand that
electromagnetic radiation can

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.320 align:middle line:10%
have effects that
are not expected

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.725 align:middle line:10%
and not understood in
the conventional sense.

00:51:46.725 --> 00:51:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's just recap
this, all right?

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.610 align:middle line:84%
What we're inferring
here is that there

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:53.785 align:middle line:84%
is an energy more subtle
than electromagnetic energy.

00:51:53.785 --> 00:51:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the things that I've

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:57.160 align:middle line:84%
been working with
people and teaching them

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:00.450 align:middle line:84%
how to find that and
identify within themselves,

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.910 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have an ultimate
harmonizing and healing

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:04.740 align:middle line:90%
effect on our own systems.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.473 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
you're working with.

00:52:06.473 --> 00:52:07.890 align:middle line:84%
You're working
with an energy that

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:12.120 align:middle line:84%
is more subtle than
electromagnetic energy.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So can you share with us how
that relates specifically

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:18.130 align:middle line:90%
to biogeometry?

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:22.707 align:middle line:84%
Subtle energy is
not electromagnetic,

00:52:22.707 --> 00:52:23.790 align:middle line:90%
as we've seen in the film.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:25.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not electromagnetic energy.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the difference between
the electromagnetic energy

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:33.420 align:middle line:84%
that is part of our
life force that we

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.180 align:middle line:84%
get from the Earth that
is very positive for us

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and for our life, and the
harmful electromagnetic energy

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that we have there is that the
electric energy of the Earth

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.310 align:middle line:90%
is on the subtle energy level.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally
different type of energy

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.470 align:middle line:90%
than electromagnetic energy.

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And being subtle energy
level and means--

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.280 align:middle line:84%
subtle energy comprises
many dimensions.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It comprises
vitality dimensions,

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:04.870 align:middle line:84%
emotional dimensions,
mental dimensions.

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:08.050 align:middle line:84%
All this is part
of subtle energy.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you're working
with subtle energy,

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.500 align:middle line:84%
you're working on
all those levels.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you do not address the
emotional and mental levels

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:23.970 align:middle line:84%
in a human being, you can
never achieve holistic healing.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So subtle energy is something
that's not electromagnetic.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Does not follow the
laws of time and space.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Is not bound by them.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:37.620 align:middle line:84%
That means certain energy can
move in different dimensions.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It can move forwards
and passed in time.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It can move faster than
the speed of light.

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It can enter into
resonance with anything

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:49.570 align:middle line:84%
in the universe irrelevant
of time and distance.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's a fantastic
domain, this subtle energy.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And all our biological functions
and all the laws of nature

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:03.450 align:middle line:84%
are within this domain
of subtle energy.

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> In deep spiritual study, they
would call that God presence,

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:07.950 align:middle line:90%
because it's omnipresent.

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:11.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy that is
foundational to every single

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.570 align:middle line:90%
aspect of life itself.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we are bridging
the worlds right here.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Speaking about an energy,
an invisible energy

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:21.330 align:middle line:84%
that is everywhere all
the time, unwavering.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.115 align:middle line:84%
And in the world
of spirituality,

00:54:23.115 --> 00:54:25.260 align:middle line:90%
we would call that the divine.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And the world of
science, we'd call it

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:30.150 align:middle line:90%
invisible subtle energy, right?

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're speaking
one language now

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.350 align:middle line:84%
that is allowing both
worlds to be right,

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:37.653 align:middle line:84%
both worlds to be true, and both
of them to be interconnected.

00:54:37.653 --> 00:54:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The definition that we use
to marry both worlds is we

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.290 align:middle line:84%
actually use the definition of
what is energy before we divide

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:45.750 align:middle line:90%
it into its different forms?

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:50.430 align:middle line:84%
We say energy is the ability
to produce an effect.

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, yes, gravity,
know electromechanical energy,

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that's all part of.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.980 align:middle line:10%
That but your emotions, your
thoughts, your spirituality,

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.250 align:middle line:10%
does it have an ability
to produce an effect?

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it trapped within
time and space?

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:04.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:08.153 align:middle line:84%
You can think about the past,
you can move into the future.

00:55:08.153 --> 00:55:09.570 align:middle line:84%
The wonderful thing
is we actually

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:10.987 align:middle line:84%
have so many
experiments with this

00:55:10.987 --> 00:55:14.720 align:middle line:84%
where you can begin to affect
the present by even changing--

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and anybody would
know that you could

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.660 align:middle line:84%
affect the past by changing
the way you look at the past.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:20.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:20.475 --> 00:55:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the
realm of subtle energy.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.988 align:middle line:84%
You've just moved back
in time and you're

00:55:23.988 --> 00:55:25.770 align:middle line:90%
affecting the present.

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not confined
to this physical world,

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.220 align:middle line:84%
stimulus response
in a linear fashion.

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.020 align:middle line:90%
No longer.

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.875 align:middle line:84%
Now we are in this quantum
world is really what you're--

00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> An important thing when
you spoke about divinity.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.290 align:middle line:10%
Well, divinity is not
an abstract thing.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:49.410 align:middle line:10%
We should know that divinity
controls all energy effects.

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually, divinity can be
put into every practical thing

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.240 align:middle line:90%
we do in our life.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Divinity has a part at its core
to harmonize it, to balance it.

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So divinity here is
not something out there

00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:05.720 align:middle line:90%
that you believe in.

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:09.540 align:middle line:84%
No, divinity is
a real thing that

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.280 align:middle line:90%
has practical applications.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why in
biogeometry, I feel

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:20.170 align:middle line:84%
the satisfaction of
sneaking spirituality

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:22.413 align:middle line:90%
through the back door.

00:56:22.413 --> 00:56:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I do the same thing.

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Slide it in.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:26.580 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.010 align:middle line:10%
We have covered so
much ground here today

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:32.470 align:middle line:10%
from the fundamentals
of biogeometry

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.260 align:middle line:10%
to how to change your
life with subtle energy.

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have barely
scratched the surface.

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Join us in part two with Dr.
Ibrahim Karim and his daughter,

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Doreya Karim, to hear why
the government of Switzerland

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:47.470 align:middle line:84%
sought bio geometry to help
to save their communities

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.990 align:middle line:90%
from harmful electro smog.

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:52.870 align:middle line:10%
You can learn more about
Doreya and Ibrahim Karim

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.420 align:middle line:10%
at biogeometry.ca.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.310 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for watching
"Healing Matrix,"

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:01.410 align:middle line:10%
and be sure to look for
part two of this episode.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:06.198 align:middle line:90%
