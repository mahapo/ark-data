[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:21.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So with the chakra toning,
the various tones affect

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:90%
the different chakras.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So you can also work with
the colors of the chakras

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and the organs associated with
those chakras, for instance,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
attachments as well.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So for the base chakra,
which is below the spine,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
there is associations with
survival and foundations

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and family, and also with
the areas of the body

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:90%
within that chakra.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's the base
chakra affects things

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
like the sexual organs, as
well as the sacral chakra,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
but the sacral
chakra also reflects

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
things like creativity,
and the kidneys,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and the organs within that area.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So you can go as deep as you
want to with this technique

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the chakras
and the colors involved, or you

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:84%
can just simply do the
tones, and they will

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:90%
affect those areas in any case.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
We found with this technique
that it's very simple,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually start
at a deep tone and go higher,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
or you'll just naturally
fall into that.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a deeper
tone, so the tones

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that I use for the
chakras will vary.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I'll find I'll
be able to get a high tone where

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't to begin with.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.005 align:middle line:84%
So it varies from day to day,
it varies the time of day,

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
it varies with the
emotional stuff

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're going through, as
well as how you're feeling.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that you're a
little bit tired, so you'll

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
find the day before is
completely different to how

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:90%
you are the next day.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So we find when you're
doing this technique,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
you build more and
more and more on it.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good technique
to do any time of the day.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Can do it weekly.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no hard and
fast rules with this.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
There's no right or
wrong, because it's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
all up to the individual,
and it is actually

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
a very unique experience
for each person.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:90%
So we find I actually--

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:84%
because I don't come from
a singing background,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
so sometimes my voice
will go [VOCALIZING]

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
which I found a lot of people
do, and so it's quite normal.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an opera singer,
and not a lot of people are,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
so it makes it just relax about
it and enjoy the experience

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:90%
and have fun with it.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And I find sometimes that
I'm really concentrating,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:84%
so I can feel my face
tense up, so just

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
be aware of what
you're doing as well,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and if you feel
yourself tense up,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
just try and relax a
little bit with it.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:90%
You can relax your face muscles.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So as you're going through,
if you find you are tensed up

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
or you're frowning,
you're concentrating,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
just relax and just
relax your face muscles.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything
you'd like to say?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, on that
note, you can grin.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Grinning is very good for you.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.051 align:middle line:84%
And you could notice
when you grin,

00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
you notice those muscles
in the back of your head,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and I found that very, very
helpful in chakra toning.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll be concentrating on a note,
but occasionally, the voice

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.019 align:middle line:84%
is wavering or whatever,
and if you grin,

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
it can help actually relax
down whatever that tension is

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:90%
and the note comes back.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Not always, but I thoroughly
agree with Michelle.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The main thing in any yoga-- and
this is, after all, Nada yoga,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:90%
the yoga of sound--

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.710 align:middle line:84%
that yoga means simply
union, basically.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole point
here is to join in and be

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:90%
as unselfconscious as possible.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And we've found that the
simplicity of the chakra

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
toning, you're just
coming out with any sound.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You're not being
judged by it, but you

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
do need to participate
so that you

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:84%
can hear your own vibration,
first and foremost.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Then, as in with, say, the
Pranayama that we often

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
do at the beginning
of each session,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
you start to concentrate on one
spot, and that, we've learned,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
is very, very helpful,
both for the mind,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:84%
but also for the
organs of the body.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So concentrating by not worrying
about the sounds your making,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
you then start to notice the
sound, the texture of it,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:84%
the timber of it and so
forth, and after a while,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest if
you do this practice,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
start looking at
the actual vowel

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:90%
sounds that you're producing.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a tendency, say, with
ah not so much, but with A,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:84%
to actually end up going
ah-ee and hang onto the E.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to
remain at the beginning,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and you start to notice the
structure in your throat, where

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
you're holding your
tongue, [VOCALISING]

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and the moment it becomes an
E, you drop the jaw a fraction.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is
a tremendous tonic,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.600 align:middle line:84%
because the longer you can hold
a good-sounding vowel sound,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the better it is for your body,
and after a while, the better

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:90%
it is for your vocal chords.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that people
who can't sing on pitch,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:90%
can't get the note at all, will.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And we've had groups
of people where

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
after awhile, if
you're in a group,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
you may notice that
you're all starting

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to sing a related
note or the note

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
itself in a more harmonious way,
and it gets better like that.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'd reiterate
what Michele was saying.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about what
the sound is at all.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
The only important thing is
to join in and try it out.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And I found with
this technique,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
because I'm asthmatic, and
I've also got an underactive

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
thyroid, with the toning, I
have found my lung capacity has

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
gotten better, I'm able to
project my voice a lot more.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:90%
I have more confidence.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually very
clearing, and very energizing,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:90%
and very relaxing.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So that all helps the body and
general well-being as the cells

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
respond to the tone and the
sound of your own voice.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite a
powerful technique

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
because the cells will
interact together and spark off

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
each other, so you'll find
your circulation will improve,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
your breath will
improve, your confidence,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
your clarity will
improve as well.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Things like people who
don't normally sing then

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
go to places where they
will stand up and sing

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:84%
because they've gotten used
to using their own voice.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's a powerful tool
because our soul and our spirits

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:90%
respond.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And a final note,
possibly, when you're driving,

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:90%
you can do this technique.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And I found when
I'm on long drives,

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and you know how you start to
feel a bit heavy in the head

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and tired, and I also have
a slight sinus reaction

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:84%
to air conditioning when
it's the middle of summer,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
the two notes of A in
the third eye, and also E

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:84%
for the Sahasrara, or the
crown chakra, when you actually

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:84%
come out with those
quite strongly

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
in the confines of a cab,
that can clear your sinuses

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and it wakes you up.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It actually helps balance
both hemispheres of the mind.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
nicest ways to stay awake

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
that I know for
long drive, so I'll

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:90%
throw that in for good measure.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a few things
just to talk about as well,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
because we start with
the oms at the beginning,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and then with the chakra toning,
we start from the base up

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:84%
to the crown, and then go back
down from the crown back down

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:90%
to the base chakra.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
You can vary it
as you would like.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
You can just do from
the base to the crown.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:84%
We do both because we
find that going back down

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:90%
is also grounding.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But just experiment with this,
because as I said before,

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:84%
there's no hard and fast
rules, and it's very freeing.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:90%
So just give anything a try.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:84%
If you want to try
the sound of ah,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.525 align:middle line:84%
just straight, just do that
and just keep repeating it

00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and resonate with the heart,
so focus your attention

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:90%
with the heart.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And any sound you can
use on any chakra,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
but they do resonate
with particular ones.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can say A, and
that's the third eye.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So you may find as
you're going up and down

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that when you go through
to particular chakras,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel more energized or
more clarity within that area.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I found today as we were doing
the technique, on the way

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.255 align:middle line:84%
back down, my solar
plexus suddenly cleared

00:10:27.255 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and I had more clarity, and
I got the note right on.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can really
feel when you do that.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It just sounds
crystal clear, and you

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
know that you're in
harmony with that note.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And I found that when
that happened for me,

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
I felt almost bliss.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So you become very
attuned to yourself

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
as well as you're going
through this technique.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And as I said before,
just have fun with it

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy and experiment.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, indeed.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Please enjoy.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:90%
