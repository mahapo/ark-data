00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Michelle, and I
come from a background of being

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
a massage therapist and a
Reiki master, reflexologist,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:90%
and aroma therapist.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So I've had a background in
natural therapies and healing

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and have worked in a
number of spas as well.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So have things
like Vichy showers,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and hydrotherapy
baths, and clay wraps,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and all those wonderful things.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But I've also come from a
background of being in office

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and working in administration
as well, and travel as well.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So I've been to many places, and
with sound healing I actually

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
have experienced many different
forms of sounds throughout

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:84%
different areas
in the world and--

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
such as the mother drum that
came to Australia from America,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:84%
which is the huge
Native American drum

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing
things like that.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, I've wanted crystal
balls for a number of years,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
because I found I really
resonated with crystal balls.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I also do djembe
drumming as well,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
so music has been a part of
my life for many years now.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that
with the crystal balls

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel very much
at home with them

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and resonate on a very
deep level with them.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm Prakash.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I came from a background steeped
in design and construction

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
of one-off extravaganzas
that went all over Australia.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And got into a lot of
carving, sculpting, et cetera,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and employed people in
the middle of a city.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
That all came to
a very abrupt halt

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
when I discovered that my body
was full of petrochemicals,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and I was becoming one
of those people who

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:84%
had a choice of either living in
a plastic bubble in a hospital

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
or going out to the
bush and getting away

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:90%
from the built environment.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So I very quickly found
a place, fortunately,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
forest near Noosa.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was nursed for
six months of the year

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
that I spent there
because cancers

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
were being formed and
presenting as a result

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of the petrochemical actually
ruining my immune system.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So there was a while there
where I was detoxed, incredibly

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
sensitive, barely able to
walk in the early stages

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
of partial recovery when I
realized the power of sound.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I've always played musical
instruments, guitar and flute

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
in particular, but I'd also
been commissioned about two

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
years before all
this happened to me

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
to make Native American
flutes and drums.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And I got permission
to do this, as I

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
have with many different
cultures with their carvings

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
We always acknowledge the
custodians of the land

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:84%
here, whenever we
do chakra toning.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Land being Australia, the
area the Sunshine Coast,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
so we always acknowledge
the Gubbi Gubbi people here

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:84%
as well with every
chakra toning we do.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:90%
So I'll mention that now.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered the flutes
and drums which I'd made

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:84%
were affecting me in a way
that I'd never noticed before,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.100 align:middle line:84%
as were the sounds
of the forest.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So I wound up realizing that
a lot of my actual healing

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
process was coming from
just harmonizing and being

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:90%
with the sounds of the forest.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I found I could communicate
to a small degree

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
with the wild curlews
and the dingoes.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
They would respond, and call
back, and come in closer.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:90%
So nature responds to sound.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I was beginning to realize
that my nature equally

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:90%
responded to sound.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Also, I was introduced to
chakras for the first time

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was a Tibetan Lao
Tzu self-healing system,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
where you envisage
five chakras and rather

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
like what we're doing
here, you envisage a color.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:84%
You also have a chant that
goes with each chakra.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And to my surprise, to my
skeptical mind in those days,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
within four days I was
noticing an energy boost

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:90%
purely from doing that.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've done a lot of basic
martial arts and Hatha yoga

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:84%
breathing, the pranayams
and so forth before this.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was incorporating
that as part of my healing,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
so I was very surprised to
discover this envisaging

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
technique and going through the
chakras had tremendous benefit.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And years later, we discover
that what that benefit is

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:90%
in various parts of the body.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm involved
with making.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I play Kirtan,
which is basically

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:90%
the ancient Indian process.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Kirtan, many people will know
has gone ballistic worldwide.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And Michelle plays with
me in a Kirtan band,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and we travel to various
groups of people up and down

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:90%
the countryside really.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've recorded Kirtan
with Alissa Nathaniel,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful ex-Jazz
Singer in Bali.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And you really realize
the international swell

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of fascination with
sound worldwide

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and with sound healing.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I've had the good fortune to
meet Ravi Shankar's top pupil,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
who showed me how he could heal
people by playing the sitar,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:90%
which he played so gloriously.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've supported Tibetan monks
and others with our Kirtans

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and with various concerts.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm now involved far more
in the healing nature of sound,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
having had some profound
experience of it myself,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and we've seen people
change a lot in the groups

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that we're sort of running,
if you can call it that.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:90%
We offer these things.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm now involved in making
rather large sound healing

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
instruments, which is something
coming up in the future.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So for both of us, I
met Michelle, listened

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to her poetry, and I started
to compose music around that,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and we wound up singing
in a group of three of us.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And somehow that led
organically into us just

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
listening to tones and sound
once she got the balls.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And this process has
been entirely organic.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:90%
We haven't envisaged doing this.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:90%
We've just fallen into doing it.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's grown
exponentially.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So we hope you thoroughly
enjoy what we've had to offer.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And we'll tell you
a little bit more

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:90%
about the process next perhaps.
