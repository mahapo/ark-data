00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello again, and
welcome to episode 2.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So in the last
episode, we delved

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
into the main concepts
of the Gene Keys,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and we took a first
look at our profile.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And we also started to explore
the layers of our Life's Work

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Gene Key.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to
continue that and begin

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
working more deeply
with our profile

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and exploring its
first sequence.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And the way this works is that
we take each of the Gene Keys

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:90%
in our profile.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
We contemplate them and then
apply them in our everyday life.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And as we do this, a
process of transformation

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:90%
gradually begins to occur.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.069 align:middle line:90%
This is a journey of awakening.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:84%
As we follow the algorithms
of the specific Gene Keys that

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
are hardwired into us, it's like
a cosmic kind of acupuncture

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:90%
as we hit each point.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%
And there's a logic to it.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We follow the sequence
of the different pathways

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:84%
in our profile, starting with
the Gene Key of our Life's Work

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and then along the
Pathway of Challenge

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:90%
into the sphere of Evolution.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we contemplate that
sphere and its Gene Key.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we follow
the next pathway

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:84%
called Breakthrough, which leads
to the sphere of our Radiance.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we follow the
Pathway of Core Stability.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And we end by contemplating
the Gene Key of our Purpose.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:10%
So you can see, when we take
this first journey into our Gene

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:10%
Keys, it's going to set
the stage for some kind

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:10%
of a breakthrough in our lives.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:10%
And this whole journey through
your four primary Gene Keys

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:10%
is called the
Activation Sequence.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's the first of a series
of sequences that make up

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:10%
what we call the Golden Path.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And moving through
these sequences

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
might take many
months or even years

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
because contemplation
takes time.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:84%
After all, we're
transforming our inner life.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:90%
We're doing alchemy.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just
about studying.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
This is a journey
of self-reflection

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can dip
into and out of.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So you might find that you
put it down for a while,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and it almost disappears into
the background of your life.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But then you spontaneously
pick it up again,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll find
yourself having perhaps

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:90%
one of these breakthroughs.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And each time you get to a
new sphere and a new Gene Key,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
you wait until you've
had a really good insight

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:90%
about yourself in that sphere.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And each time you experience
one of these openings

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
or an expansion, you
have to integrate it,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and you have to soften into
it, and then you move on.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:10%
And I call this process
self-illumination,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:10%
because you're being
lit up with the wisdom

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:10%
as it detonates inside you.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you have your
profile in front of you,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the
first two spheres--

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
your Life's Work at the top,
your Evolution on the right.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're joined together
by the Pathway of Challenge.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And this pathway is
really the beginning

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:90%
of your Gene Key's journey.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And it always begins
with a challenge.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So take a look at the two
words for your shadows

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
in these two spheres and
see how they interact.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that there's
a story hidden here that's

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.450 align:middle line:84%
all about the core
issues of your life.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call
a shadow pattern.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficulty or a challenge
that won't go away easily.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's a story that can be
multilayered and intricate.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
this shadow work

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
can be tough because
we're going down

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
into the underworld
of our unconscious

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to retrieve the gift, the
light, and bring it back out

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
into the world and use
it to transform our life.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is the purpose
of the Gene Keys.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:90%
So what really is this shadow?

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It's actually not really a
thing that lives inside you.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a radio signal.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a frequency that we
can get stuck in whenever

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:90%
we believe that we're a victim.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constricted
viewpoint or a mindset

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that prevents love and
wisdom from flowing easily

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:90%
and clearly through our being.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So just close your
eyes for a moment

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and think about the current
challenges in your life.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're facing a health
crisis or a relationship issue.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a fear about
the global breakdown.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be stress around
money or a lack of purpose.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:84%
For some of us, it
might be loneliness,

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:84%
or it could be
anxiety, or someone

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
you love being in a crisis,
and you don't know what to do.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So as you're tuning into
the biggest challenge you're

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
facing in your life right now,
remember that you're not alone

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and that we all have these
difficulties in our lives

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and that we all experience
similar sufferings, just

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:90%
in different forms.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So our pain can actually
bring us together.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And just take this moment to
contemplate the difficulty

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
that you're dealing
with right now.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, perhaps you're
not dealing with it yet.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's too scary,
and that's also fine.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:90%
That's totally understandable.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Only you know what
this thing is.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you turn with courage to
face this challenge, somewhere

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
deep inside your being,
inside your body,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:84%
you might feel a little tremor
or a difference in your energy

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.430 align:middle line:84%
as you open yourself up to
accept this challenge a bit

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:90%
more deeply.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
ready, just open your eyes

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:90%
and take a look at your profile.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And look at your sphere of
evolution and the three words

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:90%
next to it.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to look at
the word for the shadow

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:10%
because it may well
help you to unravel

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:10%
the story around this current
difficulty in your life.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It's always the same archetype.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
It just manifests
in different ways,

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
so understanding
this shadow is going

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to be an integral
part of your journey.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And in this series, we're
going to go deep into it

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
together and touch
aspects of our lives

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.510 align:middle line:90%
that aren't touched very often.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So this can be a very
therapeutic and quite a tender

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle line:84%
journey, and I want you
to be ready for that.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we use the
language of the Gene Keys

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
to help us reprogram and
rethink the way we see things

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
so that we can start to
accept ourselves more deeply.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And then our heart
begins to open,

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and we can embrace
more of our suffering.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And then paradoxically,
our genius

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:84%
starts to emerge
from that shadow.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really
powerful process.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So going back to the two
spheres of your Life's Work

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and your Evolution, let's
see how those two shadows

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:90%
connect with each other.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And here I've got
a good example.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the profile of
the late Queen Elizabeth.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that her Life's
Work is Gene Key 3, which

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:84%
is the shadow of chaos,
and her evolution

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
is Gene Key 50, which is
the shadow of corruption.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So we have corruption
and chaos, both really

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
powerful and difficult
words and words we generally

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:90%
not want to apply to ourselves.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things you'll
learn about the Gene Keys,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
these are global words.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:90%
These are collective of terms.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that Queen
Elizabeth or you--

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
if you happen to
have the same keys--

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:90%
are corrupt or chaotic beings.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It's that you're going to meet
that frequency in your life.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So these are simply
archetypal energies

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
have to deal with.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.835 align:middle line:84%
But those two shadows
of chaos and corruption

00:08:06.835 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:84%
actually make sense when you
really think about the queen

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.793 align:middle line:84%
and you think about
some of the things

00:08:10.793 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:84%
that she had to deal with over
the course of her long life.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the hardest
things for any parent

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is to watch their
children suffer,

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
to see the chaos of their
emotional lives falling apart,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and the disappointment and
the breakdown of their dreams.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And this chaos was
something that the queen

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:84%
had to go through many
times in her life.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And as for the
shadow of corruption,

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
for her, this was more about
the corrupting of the values

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and principles that she held and
seeing that they weren't being

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:90%
upheld by younger generations.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Not that she was morally
superior or anything like that,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
but she must have found it
very challenging to navigate.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.453 align:middle line:84%
>> A queen, newly crowned,
accompanied by her husband.

00:08:57.453 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Being part of the generation
who came out of the second World

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:10%
War, and she had to embrace this
challenge and evolve because her

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:10%
children's and other people's
values were so different from

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:10%
hers.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So remember that the words
for your shadows aren't you.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
influence your narrative,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
the story of your life when
you tune into their frequency.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to
contemplate your Gene Keys,

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you, you will see
your life story, your mythology,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:90%
written here.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the story
of your shadow playing out,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
it's both painful, but it's
also incredibly liberating

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:84%
because we all have
one of these stories.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And the trick, the real
trick, is how we deal with it.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And one question I often
get asked is, why do we

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
have to go through so much
shadow, so much difficulty

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:90%
in our lives?

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Why does it have to be so hard?

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a poignant
and tender question.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a very
brave question to ask.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It's brave to accept the shadow
because it has layer upon layer.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And there's no quick fix to it.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
But the answer to why
is there so much shadow,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:84%
it perhaps lies
in this one word--

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:90%
evolution.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:90%
We are here to evolve.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we're really honest
about our shadow patterns

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and we take
responsibility for them,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
then we begin to transform
them and empower ourselves.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we go on to discover
that these dark lumps

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of black coal actually have
diamonds hidden inside them.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So the queen, you can
also see her gifts here.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
The gift of innovation
and the gift of innocence.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So for her to get back
to that innocence,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
she has to really go
deep into that chaos

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and begin to innovate and adjust
her value system so that she

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
can begin to rise above
the frequency of chaos

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and transcend all
those difficulties.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps all she ever really
wanted was a simple life,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:90%
and that was her innocence.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
with corruption.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The higher frequency
of corruption

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is the gift of equilibrium
and the siddhi of harmony.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:10%
So by maintaining
her equilibrium

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:10%
and trying to keep things
balanced in her life,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:10%
she could find her
way to harmony.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And she tried to hold that
inner balance all her life,

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and she did her best to
maintain it for the collective.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of what you
think of the monarchy,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
the process of dealing with
our shadows is universal,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:84%
but it's also deeply
personal for each of us,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:90%
just as it was for the queen.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose of all of
this is for us to discover

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.820 align:middle line:90%
the gift in the shadow.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:90%
And then we've made the gold.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's our alchemy.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to pause just
for a moment with the profile

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and explore another
idea that might help

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:90%
us to understand all of this.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard of the
theory of evolution.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And I want to invite you now
to see evolution as a current,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
like an ocean current
of evolving energy.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're all caught
up in this current.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And over time, it's
pulling us from believing

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're separate,
individuated beings

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:84%
towards an understanding
of ourselves

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
as a more coherent, integrated,
higher-level consciousness.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:84%
We're all actually
one being, one entity,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
but we each color the ocean
with our own uniqueness

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of beautiful
and powerful ways.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side,
there's another current,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's known as the
current of involution.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is a notion that's
held by many cultures,

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:84%
ancient cultures, that there
is a divine higher frequency,

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
a unified field that is
gradually stepping itself down

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
so that it can embody itself
in the form, in the body.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So you have one current
evolving upwards

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:84%
from matter towards spirit,
learning and growing

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:90%
through suffering.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the other
current involving downwards

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:90%
from spirit into matter.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting here
is that if you're looking only

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:84%
from the viewpoint of
the evolving current,

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
then all you see is choices
because we have free will,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and we can decide this,
and we can decide that,

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and we can keep learning and
evolving through the choices

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:90%
we make.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:10%
But on the other side, through
the lens of involution,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:10%
everything is seen and
known at a unified level.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:10%
So everything, in a sense,
has already occurred.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:10%
So from the viewpoint
of involution,

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:10%
there is no free will.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:10%
There's only
predestination because

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:10%
in the timeless dimension of
the divine, there is no time,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.760 align:middle line:10%
and there is no
chooser, so there

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:10%
can't be any choice either.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And from this
involutionary perspective,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
it's like we're part of a big
tapestry that we're weaving.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients
called it dharma,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the destiny, the flow,
the plan, the weave of your life

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:90%
and the life of the whole.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're all moving
gradually in time

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
towards this coherent,
unified moment when

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
one day, we arrive back at our
source and know ourselves fully.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Then we're awakened.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.480 align:middle line:90%
We're enlightened.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And the whole is
enlightened as well.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.790 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at this through
the involutionary current,

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to understand
these siddhies, those highest

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.830 align:middle line:84%
energies that are waiting
to emerge from inside us.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's why the mystics say
that you're already enlightened.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Or it's like Christ saying
that the kingdom of heaven

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:90%
is already within you.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And this involutionary
view, it also

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
helps us to understand
why we have the shadow

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
because the shadow is the
raw material that we're here

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
to transform into the
gift and the siddhi,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
while at the same time, the
grace of the higher self

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:84%
is trying to come down
into the form to transform

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:90%
the shadow back into the light.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like that old saying
where God or the divine

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
is looking for you just as
hard as you're looking for it.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So evolution is all about how
we respond to our challenges

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and how we grow and create more
love, more beauty, and more

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:90%
intimacy.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And involution is how we can
tap into the higher frequencies

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
through revelation, through
contemplation, and meditation.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And as we tune into
these higher frequencies,

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:90%
so they begin to work inside us.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we have our
greatest breakthrough.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
We begin to trust
in our suffering,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and we stop turning
away from it.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
So we need both views.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
We have to strive, and
we have to surrender.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:84%
We strive to
transform the shadow

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:84%
from the evolutionary
view until we

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:84%
meet the grace of the
involutionary view.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to surrender
and let it transform us.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful,
paradoxical dance.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So the only way we can
heal our inner self

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:84%
is by going on the
spiritual journey.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:10%
And it's a warrior's journey.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:10%
And this is how we really
work with our Gene Keys,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:10%
by becoming shadow
hunters, warriors of light.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do it?

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:84%
How do we truly
transform our shadows?

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, to give you
an example, I'm

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
going to talk just a little
bit about my own profile.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:10%
You'll see the Gene Keys of
my Life's Work and Evolution,

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:10%
and you can see here that
I have the shadows of doubt

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:10%
and confusion.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And shadows kind of
often hunt in pairs.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And your Life's
Work and Evolution

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:90%
always operate together.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So take a look at yours, and
you might see a similar pattern.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It's really a single dynamic,
a kind of negative biofeedback

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:90%
loop.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So I used to have a huge
amount of self-doubt.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And then when I began to
receive all this wisdom,

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.810 align:middle line:84%
it just increased my
self-doubt exponentially.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:90%
So I was deeply confused.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty is that
the shadow of doubt

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:90%
contains the gift of inquiry.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the inquiry transformed
the doubt into my inner journey

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:90%
towards truth--

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that's the siddhi--
so that one day,

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I arrived at truth by
following my doubt.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here the
magic of a Gene Key--

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.840 align:middle line:90%
doubt, inquiry, truth.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And out of this came my inquiry
into every single Gene Key

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
to understand my own doubt
so that I could resolve it.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And you might think that
that's a bit extreme,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:90%
but I needed to know.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:10%
And as I explored
and inquired, a gift

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:10%
emerged from within
each Gene Key,

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:10%
which began to settle my
doubt and bring me out

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:10%
of my confusion.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And out of all that came
this whole body of wisdom.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And then out of that came my
book, The Gene Keys, which

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:90%
is all about illumination.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the siddhi,
my 64th siddhi.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm an example of how
enormous creativity can emerge

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
out of the shadow when
we summon the courage

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:90%
to really lean into it.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But I want to get
back for a moment

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to the art of contemplation, the
central technique of the Gene

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.178 align:middle line:90%
Keys.

00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And you might remember
that I invited

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:84%
you to start a practice of
pausing in your daily life.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to put a
bit more flesh on this

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
so that you can understand how
such a small thing can have such

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
a profound and widespread
effect in your life

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:84%
because when we pause, we
create a spaciousness inside us.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And in that space, we come into
presence with the frequencies

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that we are attuning
to at any given moment.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So when we pause, we become
aware of the quantum environment

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.280 align:middle line:90%
that we're creating around us.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:84%
That's our thoughts, our
breathing, our feelings.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is often where we
meet the shadow, when we pause.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we realize
that we're actually

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:90%
feeling anxious or uneasy.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So we listen to that,
and we remind ourselves

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:84%
that this is just a frequency
that we're attuning to.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we can change
it quite easily.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I always remember Ram Dass, a
wonderful spiritual teacher,

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:84%
speaking about his
various neuroses

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.382 align:middle line:84%
and how he would
invite them in for tea.

00:19:38.382 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Ah, addiction, come on in.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Pull up a seat.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Have a cup of tea.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Ah, exhaustion, come and
lie down here by the fire.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, anxiety, let me
give you a massage.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Have a cup of tea.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we start to
transform that shadow energy.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
We make a space for it,
and then we allow it in.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are three main stages
to transforming the shadow

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:90%
through contemplation.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're called allowing,
accepting, and embracing.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
stage, allowing.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And allowing doesn't mean that
you have to like the shadow.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:90%
You can hate it.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:14.890 align:middle line:90%
You can be angry.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
You can feel any
energy that you want.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:90%
You can feel utterly numb.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that energy
is, you just allow it.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So allowing is very
generous and very passive,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:90%
and it's very powerful.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Acceptance.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Acceptance isn't easy.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:84%
It isn't something
that happens quickly.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:90%
It's like taming a wild horse.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
You may have to wait a long time
with your hands stretched out.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen a
horse whisperer do that?

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.828 align:middle line:84%
They can wait for hours
and hours for that horse.

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, there's
this magical moment

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.300 align:middle line:84%
when the horse suddenly
realizes that they're not

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:90%
going to quit on him.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a profound moment.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:90%
And then he surrenders.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you build
trust, through deep patience

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:90%
and gentleness.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So after this first
stage of allowing,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see how that shadow
has been conditioning us.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And we shift into the
second stage of accepting.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Acceptance is when
the gift begins

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:90%
to emerge from the shadow.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Kinetic energy is
released from what

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
was a blocked cellular channel
somewhere in our system.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are powerful
health benefits

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to this process because
it's in our subtle energy

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
network, our meridian
system, that these shadow

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:90%
blockages occur.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And they can remain
blocked for years.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite something when
all of a sudden, they open up.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And energies can suddenly
rush through our body,

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and old pains and problems
can subside overnight,

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:84%
all because we fully
accepted a shadow.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, these
physical openings

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:10%
really occur at the third
stage, which we call embracing.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:10%
So with embracing, you're
in an even deeper stage when

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:10%
you've completely
accepted the difficulty,

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.970 align:middle line:10%
and then you let go of it.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
happens spontaneously.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:90%
It just suddenly drops off you.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
An enormous joy can
suddenly flow through you

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:84%
as though for no reason, or
a sense of awe, or perhaps

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
some deep grief might come
out, or some long-hidden trauma

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:84%
from when we were young, all
just from creating the space so

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:90%
that the shadow could breathe.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So working with the Gene
Keys and with this process

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
of contemplation and
inquiry can really

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:84%
dismantle some of the
deep and difficult issues

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:90%
that we carry inside us.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I think this might be a nice
moment to take to pause.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I'd share a
little transmission with you

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
about the code
behind the Gene Keys

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.640 align:middle line:90%
and where it all comes from.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is a few minutes
for the left brain.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:10%
So we know that the Gene Keys
are 64 universal attributes

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They're contemplative archetypes
that are inspired by our DNA

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and by the I Ching and another
system of self-knowledge

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:90%
called human design.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And each Gene Key is a
multidimensional portal

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:84%
into your inner being that's
designed to activate your higher

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
purpose and, ultimately,
that can allow you to embrace

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:90%
your own inner divinity.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
writing The Gene Keys,

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I originally recorded the
chapters, first as audios,

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and then I spent many years
deeply contemplating them.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're a map of
human consciousness,

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:84%
but they can also be
understood at other levels.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you
can see not just

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
how individuals are wired
to go through this process

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
of ascension, but
entire gene pools

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:84%
are also moving through
these transformations.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So they help show us that the
transformation is everywhere.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.470 align:middle line:84%
It's going on
everywhere all the time.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So each Gene Key is also
part of a wider code,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:90%
a huge genetic clock of cycles.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And the Chinese discovered this
incredible code and laid it out

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
in the teaching of the I
Ching with its 64-fold matrix.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So the Gene Keys are a new
rendition of the I Ching

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and a mechanism to
decipher our reality

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
through this pattern of the 64.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And we find this magic
number all over the place.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's in our DNA,
which has 64 codons.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:84%
We find it in the
eight octaves of music.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:10%
It's hardwired into the 64-bit
technology of our computer

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.300 align:middle line:10%
systems.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.560 align:middle line:10%
It's there in physics.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:10%
It's in the tetrahedral
geometry that

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:10%
may underlie space time itself.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.740 align:middle line:10%
The 64 is also seen in the
architecture of life forms

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:10%
and the phi spiral
and the golden ratio.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:10%
It's a mathematical
correlation that is

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:10%
spread throughout the universe.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And every Gene Key has a
relationship to our DNA,

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:10%
to the amino acids, and
to the correspondences

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:10%
between the amino acids,
which we call codon rings.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But the Gene Keys also
have correspondences

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
with the stars and
the constellations

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and their positions
in the cosmos,

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.090 align:middle line:84%
along with the
organs in our bodies

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:90%
and even with our mythologies.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:10%
So let's return to our
profile because it's

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:10%
your profile that has the
particular gift of awakening

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:10%
your individual mythic story.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And just as the great
mythologist Joseph Campbell

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
entreated us to
follow our bliss,

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
we'll be following the path
to our siddhies, those highest

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:90%
words which represent our bliss.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And our bliss is written
and stamped in our DNA.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just completely
dormant in most of us.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:90%
We're like sleeping Buddhas.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So we'll finish by looking
at the profile of Yogananda,

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:84%
the great spiritual teacher who
brought many Eastern teachings

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.130 align:middle line:90%
to the West, including yoga.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And you may know his book,
Autobiography of a Yogi,

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
where he recounts many
stories about his life

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and his spiritual development.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So Yogananda, we
can see here, has

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Gene Keys 54 and 53 as his
Life's Work and his Evolution.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:10%
So Gene Key 54, represents the
kundalini, the serpent path.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:10%
And it starts with the shadow
of greed or material ambition,

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:10%
and it shifts into
its higher frequency

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.570 align:middle line:10%
as the gift of aspiration.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So we could look
around the world,

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and we could see all
the people with Gene Key

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
54 driven by the shadow
of materialistic ambition.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And Yogananda started with
that same energy, that code,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
but he decided to stand
against that greed.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:10%
And he was able to transform
it into spiritual aspiration,

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:10%
the gift.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And finally, one day,
Yogananda took it all the way.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:10%
And then greed became ascension
when he realized his oneness

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:10%
with the divine.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And his Evolution, this
is immaturity to expansion

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:90%
to superabundance.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So his journey transformed his
immaturity into inner expansion,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and he expanded his
awareness through meditation

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:90%
and yogic discipline.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is an example of
how our Evolution turns

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:90%
our suffering into our genius.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.720 align:middle line:84%
From the challenges of life
comes this expansion of service.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, people
all over the world

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:84%
have access to yogic
teachings that support them

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:90%
in their everyday lives.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the superabundance
of love in action.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So take a good look at your Gene
Keys in these first two spheres.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And take courage and
accept the challenge

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:84%
of transforming your own shadows
through the power of your heart.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And take some time to
contemplate and learn more

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:90%
about those shadows.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And pay special attention to
your gifts, and especially

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:84%
those higher, transcendent
siddhies that you have.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And try and see
yourself as Yogananda

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
saw himself through
the eyes of his master.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And keep reminding yourself that
you have an incredible power

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:90%
asleep inside you.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll slowly
start to feel it waking up,

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and your life will begin
to change all around you

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.790 align:middle line:84%
as that involutionary
energy of grace touches

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:84%
you in all kinds
of magical ways.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And let's never again forget
that every shadow contains

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:84%
a gift because that single,
simple revelation can utterly

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:90%
change our lives.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Next time, we'll be looking at
DNA through the eyes of a mystic

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and finding out how it can
program human consciousness.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And we'll also learn what true
radiance looks and feels like

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and how our sphere of radiance
can keep us healthy and glowing

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:90%
from the inside out.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:04.000 align:middle line:90%
