00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to the Gene
Keys, luminous codes woven

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
into your very DNA,
waiting to be remembered.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:84%
From the timeless E
chain to the double helix

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
structure of our genes,
a binary language

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%
whispers beneath it all.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.080 align:middle line:84%
By calculating the time,
date, and place of your birth,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
you'll discover your
hologenetic profile,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:84%
a snapshot of the
cosmic clock the moment

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.840 align:middle line:90%
you took your first breath.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
This is your personal
imprint, a sacred invitation

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:84%
to unlock your Gene Keys,
not to fix yourself,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
but to remember
who you truly are.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:10%
Hello, and a warm welcome
to this 10-part series about

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:10%
the Gene Keys.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:10%
My name is Richard Rudd, and I'm
the founder of the Gene Keys.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:84%
The Gene Keys are
a series of tools

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:84%
for personal and
planetary transformation,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and their purpose is to change
our life from the inside

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
out so that we're living
at the absolute zenith

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
of our potential.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And most of us are
already doing the best

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:90%
we can to live our best lives.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, there are so
many tools and teachings

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that can help us, and I know it
can feel a bit like a minefield

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And for many of
us, it's hard just

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:90%
to find the time for it all.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be entirely
honest with you,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
right from the very
beginning of this journey.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
The Gene Keys isn't
another quick fix.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about
sticking a band-aid

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
on a problem in
your life, and then

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
another band-aid
on another problem.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you take
your car to the mechanic,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
you just want them to fix
the car so it runs better.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
You want to save time and money
and you want it done fast.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But if we apply that
kind of philosophy

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
to our body and
our relationships

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and our health or
our finances, it's

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
not going to work for very
long because we'll just

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
be patching up a car that
sooner or later it's just

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
going to break down
permanently, or at best,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
it's going to limp
along and keep having

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:90%
to go back to the garage.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So Gene Keys is
different from that.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:84%
If you want to live
your best life,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
you can't just keep patching
it up and hoping for the best.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember when you were a young
child and your inner engine

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
was brand new and you were
just filled with light.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Your heart and your
mind were truly open.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Your health was radiant,
and you shone with a kind

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:90%
of innocent, pure wisdom.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what the
Gene Keys can do for you.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
They can give you
some of that back.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you bring your
life to this garage,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:90%
we don't just patch you up.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
We do a whole engine
rebuild from the bottom up.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:84%
We clean, we repair, we polish
every part of your inner being,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and then we put it all
back together again.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you emerge with
this sparkling life

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:84%
with an engine that's
just powering in harmony.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:90%
So you're glowing with health.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Your relationships are
flowing and fulfilling

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:90%
and you feel great.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I'll be your guide, but we're
going to do this together

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:84%
because to heal a whole
life, it's just not

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
realistic to think that
you can do it that quickly,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
or that you can leave it
in someone else's hands,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much of an
expert they are in their field.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So over the next
10 episodes, I'm

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
going to take you right into
the heart of the matrix of you.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:90%
So let's get started.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
This is your personalized
Gene Keys profile.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't
got yours yet,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to pause here
so that you can download it.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:10%
And you'll find
it on genekeys.com

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:10%
under the free profile.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully now you have
your Gene Keys profile

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:90%
sitting in front of you.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
and look at it,

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
because these are the
blueprints of your inner life.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
This is an incredible
map, and you'll

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.168 align:middle line:84%
be amazed at where
it can take you.

00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're going to spend

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:90%
our time exploring together.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:10%
If you want to
understand the world,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:10%
consider it in terms of energy,
frequency, and vibration.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:10%
This is a powerful
quote from Nikola Tesla.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Gene Keys
are a system based

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
on the science of
frequency and the idea

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that the universe, or
consciousness itself,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
is a living, rippling
field made up

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
of infinite layers and levels
of frequency and vibration.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And these can be sound
frequencies, light frequencies,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
or emotional, mental,
and physical frequencies.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And they all exist as a
vast, multi-layered tapestry

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And a huge number of
people on this planet

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
are functioning at a fairly
low frequency compared

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:90%
to their true genetic potential.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And this creates a huge
drag on our species.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's why sometimes it
feels so tough to live here,

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
because together, all we
humans create the frequency

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.565 align:middle line:90%
field that we live in.

00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:10%
So take a look at
your life right

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:10%
now, and tune in to
what level of frequency

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:10%
you're currently living at.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And be honest with yourself.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
At low frequencies,
we get entangled

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
with our unfulfilled
desires, and we often

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:84%
feel a deep sense of unease
and a general lack of purpose.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
But wherever you're
at right now,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that working
with your Gene Keys

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
is going to raise your
frequency and improve

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:90%
every area of your life.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Because as your
frequency goes up,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that it's much
easier to live in this world,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and you won't be so
weighed down by everything

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:90%
that's going on around you.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little bit
about DNA, our genetics,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
because the Gene Keys are
based on the same universal

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:90%
mathematical code as DNA.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And our DNA is amazing.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond amazing when
you really think about it.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning
new things constantly

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:90%
every day about our DNA.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:10%
If you took all the
DNA in your body,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.280 align:middle line:10%
all those coiled and
crimped, twisted strands

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:10%
of phosphate crystals from every
one of the trillions of cells

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:10%
in your body, and if you
unraveled all that DNA

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:10%
and you stretched
it out in a line,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:10%
do you have any idea
how long that would be?

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:10%
10 billion miles long.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:10%
Can you imagine that?

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And we also know
that DNA is designed

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
as an open system
that's completely

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:90%
adaptable and programmable.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:90%
It's known as neuroplasticity.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's like this huge
sponge that's constantly

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
listening and
receiving frequencies

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and nuances of instructions
from the environment.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
It hears our thoughts.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:90%
So think about this.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%
All those billions of
miles of DNA inside you

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
hears everything you
say, everything you think

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:90%
and everything you feel.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And it interprets all
of that as instructions.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So your inner life is
absolutely programming your DNA

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:90%
You're having a bad day.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:84%
You just had an argument with
your partner or your friend,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling rotten about
some of the things you said,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're pissed off with
some of the things they said.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And your mind is in a spin.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
It's going round and round in
one of those victim whirls.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, he shouldn't
have lied to me

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.585 align:middle line:84%
or she didn't listen to my
feelings, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:15.585 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:84%
That loop in your
mind that you're in

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
is programming your
DNA, and your DNA

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is innocently sending
those instructions

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:90%
to your endocrine system.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And your endocrine
system is innocently

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
trying to protect you by
releasing certain hormones

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals that
are basically feeding

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:90%
your stressful state even more.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And the thing you
want most, which

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is just for it to stop so
that you can feel good again,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
it's the very thing that
your mindset is preventing.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So we really can be
our worst enemies.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But we can also be
our best friends.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
Gene Keys comes in,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
because the language of
the Gene Keys is so precise

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's so profound that it
speaks directly to our DNA.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we can
start reprogramming

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
these old,
self-defeating patterns.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And over time, this can
have a huge impact on us.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And it can bring about a major
transformation in our lives.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
It means that the way
we think about things

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
determines the kind
of person we become,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and what our life will
look like in the future.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So we truly are the architects
of our own evolution.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:90%
So what is a Gene Key?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like an
algorithm of awakening.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
It contains a
string of language,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:84%
a code that when you apply it to
the real problems in your life,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:90%
it's like holding up a mirror.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:84%
First of all, that's pretty
terrifying because your Gene

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Keys reflect your behavior
back to you, warts and all.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
you're going to see,

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to see
it with crystal clarity,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
is your own low frequency
behavior patterns.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And this is not at your best--

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:90%
far from it.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:84%
In the Gene Keys, we
call this the shadow.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:10%
It's a term inspired
by Carl Jung.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.990 align:middle line:10%
And your shadow is always
represented by a single word.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And this word represents the
low frequency of the Gene Key.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So here's a table of
all the low frequency

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
human behavior patterns
mapped by the Gene Keys.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a particularly
pretty sight, is it?

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:84%
This is what's causing all
the problems on our planet.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:90%
But here's the cool part.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the good news, that
every one of these 64 shadows

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:90%
contains a gift.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:10%
So every single pattern of
low frequency human behavior

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:10%
contains the seed of a high
frequency behavior pattern.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:10%
And we call these the gifts.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.183 align:middle line:84%
And we all come into the
world with a series of gifts.

00:10:57.183 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're there
when we're born.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But so often our gifts
are undernourished

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
because of our upbringing or our
education systems, or the trauma

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that we may have
suffered as a child

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
from coming into a world riddled
with all these shadow patterns.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not given
the space to flourish,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
by the time most of us
get to our adulthood,

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
our gifts are mostly forgotten.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is the primary
mission of the Gene Keys.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
It's to help us bring our gifts
back to life and to unlock

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:90%
our genius.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we rediscover
our innate gifts,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
a huge creativity
emerges through us

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and a sense of optimism,
a can-do mentality.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
call the gift frequency.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:90%
So here's an example.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can follow along and
look at your own profile.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Gene key 18.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:10%
This is the shadow of judgment.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:10%
And this can be self-judgment,
like I'm not good enough

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:10%
or it can be projected judgment,
like you're not good enough.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:10%
And there's a whole
story in these Gene Keys,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:10%
but this shadow also
contains a gift.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And that gift is integrity.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:10%
So when we raise the
frequency of judgment,

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:10%
it reveals a higher
evolutionary programming.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps you can feel how the two
notes of the octave are at work.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:10%
At the shadow frequency,
the energy of judgment

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:10%
is self-defeating, while on
the higher frequency, the gift,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:10%
it can be better used
for personal betterment.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So as the shadow
becomes the gift,

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
judgment then starts
to serve us positively

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.050 align:middle line:90%
in the form of integrity.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And then it's used
in a creative way

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
rather than in a
destructive way.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can start now looking
at your own Gene Keys,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and you can see this at
work in your own life.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be exploring
this in some depth.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So every Gene Key has
a shadow and a gift.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But there's also one
more level, and this

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:90%
is the essence of that key.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So when I was conceiving
the Gene Keys, this spectrum

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, I couldn't
find a single good word

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.310 align:middle line:84%
in English, anyway, that
represented the highest

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:90%
aspect of our programming.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a linguist.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go across
to another language,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and I borrowed a
term from Sanskrit,

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient teachings
of the Vedas of India.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:90%
And the word is siddhi, siddhi.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And it means more or less
divine manifestation.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to hear
me speak this word quite

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:84%
a lot in this series, and I
don't want you to be confused.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Also, in the USA, people often
think I'm saying the word city,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:90%
as in city.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not saying that.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying siddhi, siddhi.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
It has an H in it for
the highest frequency.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:10%
So in the case of this 18th Gene
Key, the shadow is judgment,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:10%
the gift is integrity, and
the siddhi is perfection.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:10%
And here the shadow of
judgment serves the gift

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:10%
of integrity, which
in turn uplifts

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.220 align:middle line:10%
the judgment into service.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And perfection, the
siddhi, is a divine state.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:84%
It's an expression
of our DNA that

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:84%
allows us to access directly the
unified field of consciousness.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we experience this
coding at its highest frequency,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.420 align:middle line:84%
we have a direct
revelation of perfection.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
realize the perfection

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
of all beings at
every single level.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So at the highest
level, even the shadow

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
is seen as a part
of the perfection.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, for many
people, these siddhis

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:90%
they can seem a long way off.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:90%
They may even seem like fantasy.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But these stages
of consciousness

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
have always existed, and
many have experienced them

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and continue to do so, whether
that's through deep meditation,

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:84%
through ongoing
spiritual practices,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:90%
or Indigenous plant medicines.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
The revelation of the Gene Keys
is something totally unique,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
something that may not exist
anywhere else because it's

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:84%
a map of what your life could
look like with you living

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:90%
at your very highest frequency.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's a map of the
enlightened version of you.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is the foundational
language of the Gene Keys.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And over the course
of this series,

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.850 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see how
we can use these 64

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.050 align:middle line:84%
algorithms of awakening
to reshape and transform

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:90%
our reality.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Because this work
touches everything--

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
our relationships, our working
life, our health, our purpose,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
every single aspect
of our lives.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's dive into your profile.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain how it works as
we go along through the series.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But the first step
we're going to take

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:84%
is to look at the
sphere at the top.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that this
is called your life's work.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So this Gene Key is imprinted
from the position of the sun

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:90%
when you were born.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Your life's work represents
the light of your unique genius

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:90%
as you express it in the world.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's a quality,
it's a brightness,

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
it's a confidence, a grace
even that you bring to whatever

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:90%
you do in this life.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So take a look at your
gift and your siddhis,

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and begin your
exploration of these two

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:90%
expressions of your light.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the Gene Keys
words are a bit mysterious,

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.240 align:middle line:84%
but you can click on your sphere
to learn a little bit more

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:90%
about this Gene Key.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:10%
Or you can listen to
the audio I recorded

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:10%
exploring your Gene Key, or you
can read about it in the book.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Above all though,
these are words

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that you can hold in
your heart because they

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:84%
represent a creative
explosion in your life.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.820 align:middle line:10%
And then take a look as well at
the shadow word for this Gene

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.140 align:middle line:10%
Key in your life's work.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:10%
This is the pattern that
undermines your life's highest

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:10%
expression.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And remember, these
are not easy words,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
and they're also collective
terms for whole frequency fields

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:90%
that we can get caught in.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
This shadow might be something
that comes from within you,

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
or it might be something that
you attract from the outside,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
but it's probably a
combination of both.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's take an example.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you have Gene 42.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the shadow
of expectation.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
with expectation

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:90%
always comes disappointment.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of disappointment
will follow this shadow,

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and it will very likely creep
into your relationships.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And it may undermine
your health.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And you may attract it into your
life in lots of mysterious ways.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
siddhi, celebration,

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:90%
you'll really understand this.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So expectation prevents you
from celebrating your life.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:90%
It keeps you at a low frequency.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And we often don't realize
how deeply we're conditioned

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:90%
by the shadow frequency.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to reflect
on your life, your past,

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and the decisions
you've made, and see

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:84%
if you can see this
shadow frequency

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and how it may have
impacted your life.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment
we see our shadow,

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that is the moment that the
sun breaks through the clouds.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to stop
feeding these shadow tendencies

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Every shadow is a victim state.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It has us believe that someone
or something outside us

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:90%
is disempowering us.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you want
to stay a victim,

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
you have to blame something
or someone outside yourself.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we first
have to see the shadow,

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and then we engage the gift.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Here's the profile
of the Dalai Lama.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:90%
His life's work is Gene Key 39.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:10%
So the Dalai Lama has the
shadow of provocation,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:10%
the gift of dynamism, and
the siddhi of liberation.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:10%
In a way, you could look
at this amazing man's life

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:10%
and you could say, well,
this is a man that's

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:10%
been deeply provoked in so many
different and negative ways.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
His people were
constantly persecuted.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:84%
As the spiritual
leader of the Tibetans,

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.400 align:middle line:84%
he's had to endure
being physically

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:90%
exiled from his homeland.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine how much
he's worried about his people.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.320 align:middle line:10%
He's been really pushed through
this Gene Key 39 of provocation,

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:10%
but he hasn't allowed this
shadow to drag him down.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:10%
He's managed to
actually transform

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:10%
of that into a dynamic,
creative mission in the world.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
He's even turned the
provocation into a gift.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:90%
This is the gift of dynamism.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:10%
Constantly traveling
all over the world,

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:10%
endlessly sharing his
love and his wisdom

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:10%
and writing books and
delivering teachings

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.220 align:middle line:10%
and really being
a true embodiment

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:10%
of his highest essence, which
is the siddhi of liberation.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So all that provocation is
actually an untransformed state

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:90%
of liberation.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.780 align:middle line:84%
But through his
life, he's taken it

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to the highest, most
transcendent capacity.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So can you look at your
Gene Keys in this way?

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you unlock your
highest life's work?

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Try and look at your shadows
as the untransformed highest

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:90%
essence of your soul.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a pretty
radical teaching.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be our
journey throughout this series,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do my utmost
to show you how awesome you are.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
You're a divine being of
massive unrealized potential,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to unlock
some of that potential.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So please don't worry if
you don't fully understand

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:90%
your own Gene Keys yet.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:84%
We are just at the beginning
of a very rich journey.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to close this first
episode by introducing you

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
to the central technique
that makes the Gene Keys

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:90%
work, contemplation.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a powerful,
informal practice

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
that when you understand it, it
can utterly transform your life.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a timeless art,
and anyone can do it

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:90%
at any age in their lives.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
You can do it sitting, standing,
walking, talking, swimming,

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
or while you're having
a nice cup of tea.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's much easier
than meditation,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's more creative and
playful than mindfulness.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And the key to it is pausing.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And it has several
layers and levels,

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
which I'll reveal as we
go deeper into the series,

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
but at the beginning,
it's simply

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:84%
about learning how to
pause regularly in your day

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and create the space so that
your inner journey has more room

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:90%
to unfold.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And without these
pauses, the insights

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom of the Gene
Keys won't reveal themselves.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So contemplation is the
key that unlocks wisdom.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And can you think of a
more valuable thing in life

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:90%
than that?

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to unlock
wisdom, the world is yours.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
understand the difference here

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:90%
between knowledge and wisdom.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is something that
we acquire from outside

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:90%
through our eyes and our ears.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:90%
We learn it.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.140 align:middle line:90%
We memorize it.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:90%
We grow from it.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But wisdom is
completely the opposite.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is already inside us.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It's in our very DNA.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And the Gene Keys
are wisdom teaching.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
There is a little knowledge,
but essentially they

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:90%
are a science of epiphanies.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Epiphany, insight,
revelation, these

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.430 align:middle line:84%
are the words that allow
us to access wisdom,

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom requires a higher
frequency field than knowledge.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond the intellect.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It requires an open
heart and an open mind.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So as you learn to
pause more, and as you

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:84%
learn to contemplate
the language of the Gene

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Keys and your profile, be
prepared for surprises,

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
for insights, for aha
moments, for breakthroughs,

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
epiphanies as the wisdom that's
inside you detonates within you.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was a boy, one of the
legends that I loved most

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
was the legend of King Arthur
and the Sword in the Stone.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fitting emblem, in
a way, for your life's work.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:10%
Because just as King
Arthur, the young boy king,

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:10%
was the only one that could
draw the sword out of the stone,

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.370 align:middle line:10%
you are the only one
that can draw out

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.610 align:middle line:10%
your genius from the shadow.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And the stone is the
dense, lower frequency

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:90%
that's hidden in your DNA.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And through a process
of contemplation,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
you're going to draw out
your genius, your sword,

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to fulfill
your highest destiny.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we're
going to be doing the activation

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
sequence, which is the first
of the Gene Keys sequences.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be learning
what our shadows really are

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and how we can transform them
so that we can unlock our four

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:90%
prime gifts.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And we'll also be taking a
look at my Gene Keys profile

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and how I managed to
transform the greatest

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:90%
challenge in my life.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:53.420 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:90%
