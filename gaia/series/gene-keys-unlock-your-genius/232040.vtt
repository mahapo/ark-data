>>RICHARD RUDD: Last
time, we explored

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:10%
how our DNA is the programming
software of human consciousness.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And in our Gene
Keys profiles, we

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:84%
looked at the sphere of
radiance and the second pathway

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
in the activation sequence,
the pathway of breakthrough.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:10%
So now, we come to the
third and the final pathway

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:10%
in this sequence.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:10%
It's called the pathway
of core stability.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
In our modern world, there
is a huge lack of stability.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And whether we
realize it or not,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that's what everyone
is really looking

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.880 align:middle line:84%
for, whether through health and
diet or the quest for wealth,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:84%
which gives the
illusion of stability,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:84%
or we're searching for the
perfect relationship, which

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
we'll look at later
in this series.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
there are all the people

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
who are simply trying to escape
the instability they feel

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:90%
through addictive patterns.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
We're driven by the shadow
until we face the shadow.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
In the Arthurian
legends, the hero,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Perceval sets off on
his impossible task

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
to find the Holy Grail, to heal
the sacred wound and the land

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And on this quest, he has
to meet many challenges.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And as with all the myths
of heroes and heroines,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
these challenges are metaphors
for the human journey.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And every challenge
has the potential

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to make us stronger
because every challenge can

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:90%
lead to a breakthrough.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:90%
[INTENSE MUSIC]

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And every breakthrough
deepens our sense of stability

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
because it invites us
to let go of something--

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
a fear, a self-judgment,
an unconscious projection

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:90%
of some kind.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And as we let go of that
thing, then our whole being

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:90%
becomes lighter.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And we begin to mutate.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We go through a series
of transformations

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:90%
that get progressively deeper.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:90%
So we meet our challenge.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:90%
We experience a breakthrough.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And we become
inwardly more stable.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:90%
And you know something?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
That core stability,
it can't be faked.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It's an embodied
cellular feeling.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the anchor of our radiance.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's where the inner
light comes from.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine feeling
a level of inner stability

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that never goes away no matter
what happens in the outer world?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps you already feel that.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Or perhaps you'd really like to.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's find out how
we can bring more of that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:90%
into our lives.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at your
sphere of purpose.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Whatever gift you have
there is the quality

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that's going to bring
you this deep stability.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And whatever shadow you have
there will destabilize you.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have
Gene Key 15, which

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:90%
is the shadow of dullness.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And your life's just got a
bit small, a bit monotonous.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of stuck
in a loop of some kind

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:84%
because you keep making
decisions out of fear.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you're simply
afraid of change.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
When we try and keep things
stable in order to feel safe,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
ironically, the very
opposite happens.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:84%
We end up feeling less
stable and less safe

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:90%
because we feel less alive.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.276 align:middle line:84%
But the gift here in Gene Key
15 is the gift of magnetism.

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:90%
[UNSETTLING MUSIC]

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you have this gift, you're
an inherently magnetic being.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you meet your
challenges with courage

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and you transform
them, you break out

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
of the pattern of dullness,
where you're always

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:90%
worrying about yourself.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And you unlock your
natural magnetism.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And this magnetic
quality shimmers

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:84%
in your body, in your bones
because it's your gift.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And your highest purpose is to
be this exciting, loving being,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
not this dull life that
you've settled for.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing
about stability.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Stability isn't fixed.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:90%
It's dynamic.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Stability is about being
able to feel more love.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:84%
And it's about being able to
adapt to change and uncertainty.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
It's really powerful when you
start tuning into your gifts.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So look at a picture of yourself
when you were a young child.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see that radiant
stability in your smile.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:10%
In this example of
Gene Key 15 magnetism

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:10%
is actually about risk taking.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to be
magnetic unless you

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:90%
take some risks in life.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is a gift
that finds stability

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:90%
through taking the right risks.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
It's what the poets
called the risk of love.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't take
the risk of love,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:84%
you never break out
of the dullness.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
True stability loves
and embraces change.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:10%
Then at the highest level, in
this example with Gene Key 15,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:10%
here we have a magical word, one
of the Gene Key's magical words,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.847 align:middle line:10%
fluorescence.

00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, you may have to
look these words up in the book

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:90%
or in your profile online.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
But fluorescence really
means that your life

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
starts to flower in many,
many different dimensions

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
bliss breaking through

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:90%
from your higher self.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And all it wants is to pour
itself out into the world,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
to touch and heal people,
and to build bridges

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:84%
through your magnetic,
loving presence.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps you're beginning
to see how powerful

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:90%
your profile really is.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the
first journey, remember,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:90%
of the Golden Path.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.627 align:middle line:90%
This is the activation sequence.

00:05:45.627 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's always been our most
popular course in the Gene Keys.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:10%
Because unless you can connect
deeply with a sense of purpose

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:10%
in life, nothing else
really flows for you.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And we all really need
to cultivate this base

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:90%
of deep being inside us.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.710 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode, we
talked about the light

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that sleeps within our DNA
in the form of these siddhis.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:84%
This is your sword waiting
to be drawn out of the stone.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And only you can unlock
your own purpose.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not a thing that you're
here to do so much as a person

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:90%
that you're here to be.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So what siddhi do you have
in your sphere of purpose?

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And what is your
greatest brightness?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
What is your sword of light
to wield in this world?

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's come back for a
moment to the technique

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of the Gene
Keys, contemplation.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you a
few more practical tips

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to help you deepen
this in your life.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to describe a bit
more about how contemplation can

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:90%
unlock this light inside us.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Contemplation is the
easiest spiritual practice

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do it.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's no need to
sit on a cushion for hours

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:90%
with a frown on your face.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Meditation was designed for
monks whose lives aren't

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:90%
filled with responsibility.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's not for everyone.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
The modern world and
its layers of complexity

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
are hard enough to
navigate without trying

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to find time for
hours of meditation

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:90%
on top of everything else.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is that you
can practice contemplation

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:90%
anywhere at any time.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Contemplation even goes on
when you're not doing it.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a field that we create
behind our daily lives.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And our pauses are
the way that we

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:90%
keep dropping into this field.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So when we pause, we create
the space for the breakthrough.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:90%
We create the space for a pivot.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't learn to
pause, the magic can't happen.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And our life will just
go on in the same way.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Things may change
on the outside.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But on the inside, we'll still
feel the same sense of unease

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%
in the background of our lives.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So our contemplative
pauses can be short.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Or they can be long.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Longer isn't necessarily better.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
A short but deep moment of true
stillness can feel like hours.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And I want to invite
you to be quite

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
creative with your
pausing practice.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when
I'm going somewhere,

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I'll sometimes deliberately
leave 15 or 30 minutes earlier

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:90%
so I don't have to rush.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Then when I'm walking,
I'm not in a hurry.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I might take a longer route than
normal, maybe along the river

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:90%
or through the market.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I might stop for a
spontaneous coffee or a chat

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.270 align:middle line:90%
with someone.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Or I might just soak up
the sun for a few minutes.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is that
when you're really relaxed,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
you create a wave of
relaxation around yourself.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:90%
You look strangers in the eye.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:90%
They may not look back.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:90%
But some do.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But those are
magical encounters.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm describing
to you is symbolic.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is what I do.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:84%
But really, contemplation
is an attitude.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
It isn't really a technique.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a way of being.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
cultivate and maintain

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that mindset, that feeling
more and more in your life,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
then you'll experience
more of your gifts

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:90%
and more of your siddhis.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, really, how
the purpose of our lives

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
is something we try
so hard to find.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's always simply
here, waiting for us.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
As a wise person once said,
enlightenment is behind you.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.895 align:middle line:84%
If you slow down a bit more,
maybe it can catch you up.

[UNSETTLING MUSIC]

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to get the
most out of the Gene Keys,

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
you need to adopt this kind
of contemplative attitude.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to invite
you to be playful with it.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:84%
This is where contemplation
differs perhaps a little bit

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:90%
from mindfulness or meditation.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:90%
It's much more playful.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's take social
media as an example.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:90%
It's relentless.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:90%
It demands your addiction.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
social media has done

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is it's made us forget
how to daydream.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So try switching your phone
off and just consciously

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:84%

Or you're sitting in a cafe.

Just switch off the phone.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And allow your mind to
drift spontaneously.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
This is an inherently
healthy thing to do.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Daydreaming is the
beginning of contemplation.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
It's especially important
first thing in the morning

when you begin your day.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to be alone to
daydream just for a few minutes.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%

you do this each day,

precious moment of your day.

deeper you'll tend to breathe,

and the more your
mind can wander.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
these kinds of tips

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
in the back of my little
book on contemplation.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go on deepening our
understanding of contemplation

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:90%
as we continue in this series.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But just remember, when you're
contemplating your Gene Keys,

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:90%
it's essential to be relaxed.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And remember too, the Gene Keys
are not really about the words.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The words are just stepping
stones into these inner states.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So as our contemplation
of the Gene Keys

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
deepens and it
comes into the body,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later, we start
to experience breakthroughs.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And they can come in
lots of different ways.

Sometimes, they're emotional.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And we find ourselves crying
or laughing for no reason.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they're physical.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And our body starts to shed an
old pattern and we feel lighter.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
The chances are it will happen
spontaneously as you're pausing.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But when it does hit you,
you will definitely know.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%

Or it will fail.

And his greatest challenges are
the desire in his evolution.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:10%
This is the shadow of his
evolution, which is Gene 30,

and the half heartedness in
the shadow of his life's work.

desire something,

there's no point
in him doing it.

He'll probably try
lots of things in life.

00:12:57.405 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And many of them won't
work because his heart

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
wasn't really in it.

His life can't stop there.

There must be other things
he can hurl himself into.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And his relationships
too must be this way.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
He's an all or
nothing kind of man.

And his radiance, it's Gene Key
20, the gift of self-assurance.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So when he isn't committed,
he feels insecure.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:90%
And that destabilizes him.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:90%
So that can be a challenge.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But his breakthrough, his
very health, his radiance

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
is rooted in his whole
presence being involved.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%

his purpose whenever

he forces himself to
do something because

How do you fulfill your

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
much less angst and anxiety
there would be on our planet?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.438 align:middle line:90%
[BRIGHT MUSIC]

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to take
a moment now just

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to pose a few open-ended
questions for us

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:90%
to contemplate together.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
These are insights that are
emerging from the Gene Keys.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And they open up deeper
contemplations, many of which

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
we'll pick up later
in the series.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
The first question here is,
could humanity right now

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
be on the edge of
a quantum leap?

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the
characteristics of DNA

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
is that it tends
towards quantum leaps.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
speciation, which

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
is the process where one species
splits into two branches,

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:84%
can occur very rapidly,
especially when we're

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.472 align:middle line:84%
faced with a major
environmental crisis.

00:15:46.472 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So as you come a bit
deeper into the Gene Keys,

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:84%
one of the things you
may hear about a lot

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
is Gene Key 55, which seems
to hold the key for our age.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And Gene Key 55
contains a prediction

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are on the
edge of a huge change.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:10%
And this change,
this leap is going

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:10%
to allow human awareness to
travel outside the physical body

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:10%
and transcend the view
we have through the mind

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:10%
of being separate entities.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to become
a collective intelligence

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:90%
with a shared neural net.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But this can only
happen when enough of us

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:84%
can anchor these high frequency
energies into our physical body.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be exploring more
about this and Gene Key

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
55 later on in the series.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So the second question
is, if there's

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.690 align:middle line:84%
going to be a quantum leap,
how might this leap occur?

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
In systems theory,
it's been discovered

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that whenever a system is about
to go through a radical change,

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.840 align:middle line:84%
it often becomes very
unstable in the time

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:90%
just before the leap happens.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So at a biological level,
as the trauma ramps up,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:84%
so does the potential
for genetic mutations.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
For humanity to undergo a
species-wide transmutation,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
there are certain
factors you have to have.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:90%
One is increased heat.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Mutation requires heat.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Another factor is massive
genetic diversity.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:84%
So if a species were to
engineer its own breakthrough,

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
it would very likely
over proliferate

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
first, as we see with the
current human population,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:84%
even to the extent that we
become a danger to ourselves

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:90%
and the planet.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So although we're
quite rightly worried

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
about the damage we're doing
to Gaia and the problems

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and the horrors being caused
due to climate change,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.980 align:middle line:84%
there may also be a
hidden narrative at work.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And the current challenges
that we're facing

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:84%
could even be seen
as the death throes

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
of an old, fear-based kind
of human that senses its days

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:90%
are numbered.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Modern science
doesn't particularly

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge heightened
states of consciousness.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
It's blissfully unaware of the
evolutionary currents of grace

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that we spoke about
earlier in this series.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:84%

and helpful as it is,

the pace of logic.

[INTENSE MUSIC]

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But when we look
at the world today

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.048 align:middle line:84%
from the involutionary
perspective,

00:18:09.048 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
we can see that
there's an increasing

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
sensitivity to other
dimensions emerging in humans.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Many autistic children
are demonstrating

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
these incredible abilities
for networked consciousness.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And the growth of neurodiversity
among our population

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
shows that there are big changes
occurring in our gene pools

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and the way our
minds are operating.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:84%
If you look at all
these factors together,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:84%
rather than being
separate problems,

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
they actually point to another
story emerging on our planet.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one that actually
is filled with a lot of hope.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you read the prophecy
of the 55th Gene Key,

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:84%
it speaks of this worldwide
genetic mutation gradually

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:90%
overtaking humanity.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
This is also the
revelation of human design.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that we're
about to see the birth

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:90%
of a new kind of human.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we've seen,
DNA can trigger

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
hormones that allow us
to access higher states,

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
such as awe or unconditional
love and deep and lucid wisdom.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
You only have to look at the
list of the undeveloped siddhis

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
of the 64 Gene Keys
lying dormant in our DNA

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
to imagine where we could go
in our next evolutionary phase.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So what if the higher
purpose of DNA itself

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
is to bring about this
collective consciousness?

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Are we actually wired
for transcendence?

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Those are just some thoughts
to contemplate as we go deeper

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:90%
into the Gene Keys revelation.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a good
moment to round things off

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:90%
with a little story.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And it may help you to integrate
some of the truths underlying

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
the Gene Keys and also
help perhaps the right side

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
of your brain to
integrate this journey.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
It's about the life
cycle of the dragonfly.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful
allegory for our journey.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The dragonfly starts its
life as a larva or a nymph.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And it lives as a predator under
the water for several years.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.900 align:middle line:90%
[CALM MUSIC]

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But then one day, it does
something completely unexpected.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Having never left
the water before,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:84%
it finds a stalk
of grass or a reed.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And it climbs up towards the
sunlight and the surface.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And as it comes up and out into
the air for the first time,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.412 align:middle line:84%
it begins the most
extraordinary transformation.

00:20:28.412 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as it
comes out of the water,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the sunlight and the
air start to work on it.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And the water inside its
body generates a system

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
of hydraulics and pressure that
pushes out the new creature

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:90%
that's been developing inside.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And the thorax unravels
and snaps open the skin

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:90%
of the old creature, the nymph.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And then this beautiful,
iridescent dragonfly

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:90%
starts to appear.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And once it's dried out
and its crumpled wings

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
have unfurled, with a puff
of wind, it takes to the air.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's truly one of the most
magnificent creatures designed

by nature.

think about the process

underwater in that shadow

It climbs upwards
towards the light

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and goes through that incredible
transmutation experience.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%

monochrome underwater being

to a shining, shimmering,
multicolored flying

highest nature revealed
