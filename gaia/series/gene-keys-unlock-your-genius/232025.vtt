00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:10%
>> So in the last episode,
we talked about the pathway

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:10%
of challenge, and we started to
explore the nature of the human

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:10%
shadow and how we can use the
Gene Keys to explore our own

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:10%
shadow patterns, and
then transform them,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:10%
and find the gold that's
hiding in those dark,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:10%
underworld places in our being.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, we're going to look at
the pathway of breakthrough.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:10%
So as we journey through
our activation sequence,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:10%
this is the second
pathway that we come to.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:10%
And it's the nexus
of our alchemy.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And it ignites a
magical sphere called

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:90%
the sphere of our Radiance.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And our Radiance
is the inner light

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:84%
that lies dormant inside
us, within our DNA,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's waiting for
us to catalyze it.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And as we embrace the challenge
that our evolution keeps

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
throwing at us, those
unexpected curveballs

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
lobbed at us by the gods, we
ignite these breakthroughs.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So this session is all
about breakthrough,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is where we get to meet
the inner light face-to-face.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a secret
untransformed radiance.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
We often see in these old
icons of saints and buddhas,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
we see this aura or
light, or this halo

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:90%
around a person's head.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And these images
aren't just figurative.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a deep
scientific insight.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
down at your body

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and you look at your
hands and your legs,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
what you perhaps don't
realize is that you actually

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:90%
made up of light.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
You're made up of the
light of consciousness.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And the light of consciousness
is inside everything.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
It's timeless, eternal, and it
connects and bridges all things.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, because the subtle
light of consciousness

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.490 align:middle line:84%
is buried in our DNA, when
we manage to awaken it,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary things
can happen in our lives.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a poet and
I'm a storyteller

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:90%
from the Celtic lands.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is DNA seen through
the eyes of a mystic,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
not only through the
eyes of a scientist.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Deoxyribonucleic acid
doesn't sound very mystical,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
but DNA is the multidimensional
programming software

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So your DNA is the
code of your life.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a phosphorescence,
like those tiny sea

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
creatures that glow at night
on the edges of the waves.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:90%
It's made up of phosphates.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like a coiled serpent.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a super sensitive
to have intelligence

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
found in every single
cell of your body.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You're a sleeping dragon,
10 billion miles of radiance

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and inner fire
coiled inside you.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's how much
light there is inside us.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So depending on your
attitude at any given moment,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:90%
your DNA designs your reality.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And as you raise the
frequency of energy passing

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
through your DNA, it can
unveil these higher programming

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
functions that were
lying latent inside you.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So it can wake the
sleeping dragon,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:90%
the true power inside you.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And when these higher
functions awaken,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
they can give rise to
all manner of miracles.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And with the Gene Keys, we can
anchor those higher frequencies

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:90%
permanently in our DNA.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So your DNA is a kind
of superconductor.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It's made up of these
phosphates which

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
have electrochemical
charge capacities.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So they can read energetic
signatures all around you.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
They can take in the
frequency of your environment

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and then convert that
into your chemistry.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
They can also
upload and download

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and store data, energetic data,
at different quantum levels.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So bioenergetic data,
mental data, emotional data,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:90%
it's all stored inside our DNA.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And DNA has been shown to
capture and weave light photons

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
around itself
because of its love

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:90%
of creating toroidal shapes.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, you could
look upon DNA as a wormhole,

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
as it spontaneously forms
these serpentine shapes,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
these mini tornadoes
of consciousness,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
which generate powerful
currents within us.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
allows us to harmonize

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
with universal patterns and
geometries found in nature.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So in that respect,
we are made up

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
of trillions of tiny
wormholes, and we're also

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:90%
one giant wormhole.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.180 align:middle line:90%
So think about this.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
DNA is constantly
converting the frequency

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum environment
into the chemistry of our body.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum
environment around you

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is made up of energy signatures
of all the people around you.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some people lift
our spirits and others lower

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:90%
our spirits.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
The thought forms, the opinions,
the worldviews of the people

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that we're connected
with, they're

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
all part of your
quantum environment.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you've ever spent
time alone in deep silence

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and then another person
suddenly steps into your space,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
you can immediately feel
their inner quantum world.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And depending on their
frequency at that given moment,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
you pick up everything, whether
it's a Shadow, a Gift, a Siddhi.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
We also know that DNA
expands and contracts

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
according to emotions and
thoughts and attitude.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's also written in
a user-friendly, simple,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:90%
programmable language.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And so a computer can read
your DNA and sequence it.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to
human languages in the way

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:90%
that it's created.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:84%
So your DNA understands the
frequencies of language itself.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So it understands these
words being spoken right now.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Not perhaps the literal meaning,
but the energetic signature

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
behind the tone and
cadence of these words.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So when we're using the
words for the Shadows

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Gifts and
the Siddhis, we're

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:84%
actually using a language
that DNA can relate to

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and can resonate with
at a frequency level.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So by using the Gene
Keys, you can literally

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:90%
reprogram your whole life.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And then there are also
epigenetic influences.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And these are influences
that come from outside us.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So our environment where
we live impacts our DNA.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:84%
If you live in a country
in a rural situation

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
shape who you are.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Or if you live in
an urban situation,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
you'll be strongly impacted by
all the different frequencies

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And neither one is
better than the other.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just about how you can take
advantage of each environment,

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:84%
or else you become a
victim of that environment.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're also impacted
by the cosmic environment,

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:84%
by celestial and
solar radiation,

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:84%
by sunspot activity, and
the movements and geometries

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.570 align:middle line:90%
of the spheres.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.867 align:middle line:84%
These are subtle but
powerful frequencies,

00:07:36.867 --> 00:07:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and this has always
been the intuition

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
of true astrology, the
ability to read and interpret

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
celestial frequencies as
they impact our biology.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
We're also impacted
by diet and lifestyle.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
That's another
epigenetic influence.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:84%
What we eat, how we
live is who we become.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA is also
impacted by crisis,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
by things like wars or divorce
or death or stress or world

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:90%
politics.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
happens around us

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:84%
is impacting us at
a genetic level.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And that includes the
good things as well, so

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
beautiful works of art, the
movies we watch, the music we

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:90%
listen to.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:10%
And if we're constantly watching
the news headlines and all

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:10%
they do is relay the
shadow, that too is then

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:10%
programming our DNA.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Words like unprecedented,
alarmed, protest,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:90%
unrest, radical, failed.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, our technology
is another epigenetic influence

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:90%
on us.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Our use of social media,
of what we take in

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:90%
and how we take it in.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And the key thing with
all of this is attitude.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So how do we build
resilience so that we're

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:84%
able to not just withstand
it all, but transform

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
all that shadow frequency
into something more refined?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And the answer lies
in your Radiance.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Look at your profile for a
moment, and look at the Gene Key

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that you have there in
the Radiance sphere.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.080 align:middle line:84%
That shadow that
you have there is

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
how you allow the
world to overwhelm you.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:10%
And that gift that
you have there

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:10%
is how you handle that
overwhelm and turn it around.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So I have, for instance, Gene
Key 35, the gift of adventure.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So I just turn everything
into an adventure.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Every difficulty can
be seen as a means

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:90%
of opening up to greater love.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And the worst thing we
can do is to shut down,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to hide away, or try and
avoid negative influences.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:90%
We can't avoid them.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
quantum environment.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can stop
listening to the news,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
but unless everyone else stops,
then that quantum environment

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:90%
of fear doesn't stop.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:84%
You can close your eyes and
your ears and your doors,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.410 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't go away.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn
to unlock the Gift

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and the Siddhi of our Radiance.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Our health depends on it.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:84%
But it can also feel
kind of counterintuitive,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:90%
like when a storm comes.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Most of us want to run indoors
rather than go out and embrace

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:90%
the storm with an open heart.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But when we do open our heart
and the light pours through us,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:90%
it transforms everything.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:84%
All those negative
frequencies are instantly

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
vaporized by our love.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you unlock the
gift of your radiance,

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
you'll never be alarmed by
any epigenetic negative forces

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:90%
again, ever.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
great breakthrough

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
that we each have to
make in our lives.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I also want to say a word
here about DNA and memory,

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
because we now know
through science

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that the ancestral
memories can be carried

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:90%
forwards for many generations.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And so traumatic
experiences can be imprinted

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
in US from several
generations back,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and we can carry them
unwittingly into our lives,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.367 align:middle line:90%
often without realizing it.

00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of us have been
carrying around different kinds

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
of genetic burdens,
but at the same time,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
we also carry the
gifts of our ancestors.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:10%
And no one knows how
deep these memories go,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:10%
so it's really interesting
just to consider these things.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
fractal architecture

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of what's called the
non-coding DNA that makes up

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:84%
99% of all the DNA in our
body, it's quite likely

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to be where the secret
memories of our ancestral lines

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:90%
are encoded.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Nature doesn't do
things for no reason.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Just because we don't understand
what it is, doesn't mean

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't hide a huge secret.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And my mystic hunch is that
most of the DNA inside us

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.540 align:middle line:84%
holds the evolutionary
memory of our entire species,

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
of our entire
lineage encoded form.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So we know what it's like to be
a lion, or a turtle, or a worm,

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
or a bird, because we've
been all those creatures.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:90%
And we're also gods.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
We are the oak tree that
lies hidden in the acorn.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We are the butterfly hidden
inside the caterpillar.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We contain universes inside
these Siddhis, these heightened

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:90%
states, these future memories.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We are gods and
goddesses in the making.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, let's return
to the profile

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and have a look at this
pathway of breakthrough,

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and how it leads to the
Gene Key of Radiance.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Gift and the Siddhi
in your Radiance Gene Key.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
These are the qualities
waiting to emerge through you

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:84%
as you open to these higher
frequencies in your life.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at your Radiance,

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see it as the
magical gift that is wanting

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:90%
to pour through into your life.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's really what
keeps us healthy.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And so much of health is to
do with this inner light.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:84%
True health is about
allowing this life force

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
to pour through our
body and our being,

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and being able to meet our
shadows with the uplifting

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
energy and the frequency
of these gifts.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you can look at
the shadow of the Gene

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Key of your Radiance,
that is what

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:90%
may be undermining your health.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:10%
So take a good look at
it and go deep into it

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:10%
over the coming
weeks, and really

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:10%
think about how you might be
undermining your own health.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Here in my Radiance, you can
see that I have the shadow

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:90%
of hunger, Gene Key 35, hunger.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that
hunger, the shadow side

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:84%
of the boundlessness
of the Siddhi,

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
of the boundless
energy, that shadow

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
is a deep sense of
restlessness that I feel.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Many of us feel this.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And you see how
restlessness is kind

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:90%
of untransformed boundlessness?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So when I become
restless in my spirit,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I can really undermine my
health because I lose touch

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:90%
with a state of trust in life.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I lose my flow, and
then I become perturbed,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and I feel stress
moving through my body.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
I have to watch in my life,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that I don't give way to
that sense of restlessness.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'd like to take us a bit
deeper now into our profiles,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to introduce
you to the 6 lines.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:10%
Every Gene Key is
made up of a hexagram

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:10%
from the Chinese I Ching,
this great mystic book written

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:10%
thousands of years ago.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And a hexagram is a stacked
symbol made up of six lines.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:84%
They're either broken
or unbroken lines.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And these six lines, they're
like colors or codings

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.677 align:middle line:84%
that add a lot of depth
and story to each Gene Key.

00:14:52.677 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
your profile, you'll

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:84%
see that every one of
your Gene Key numbers

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:84%
has a dot and then another
number after the dot.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:10%
This is your line number,
and it's between 1 and 6.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:10%
It's always got to be
between number 1 and 6.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:84%
This means that every
one of your Gene Keys

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is in one of six
potential octaves.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll have a mixture of
lines throughout your profile.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And we simply don't have time
to explore all the 64 Gene

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Keys in this series.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
But we are going to
explore these six lines

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and see what amazing stories
they hold for each of us.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
little journey now

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.743 align:middle line:84%
through the six lines
of our radiance.

00:15:29.743 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:10%
And the thing about the
lines is that we're actually

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:10%
influenced by all of
them, all the lines,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:10%
because we live in this
quantum environment.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:84%
You can pay special attention
when we come to your line,

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
but they really contain
insights for us all.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a line 1
here in your radiance,

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
then you're someone who has
to understand your own health.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:84%
You really have to
know your own body

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and educate yourself
about health,

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and explore all the different
possibilities of what

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.320 align:middle line:90%
makes you healthy.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example
of Ra Uru Hu, and he

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:84%
was the founder of
Human Design, which

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
has been a great inspiration
for the Gene Keys.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:10%
And Ra had a first
line radiance,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:10%
and it's all about individual
empowerment, the first line.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:10%
So line 1's are very
deep contemplators.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And this iconic
statement, "know thyself,"

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:84%
is a deep inward journey
that keeps line 1 healthy.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
everyone has to create

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:90%
their own system like Ra did.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
This is about empowering
yourself and empowering others

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility
for their own well-being.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
It's about knowing what's good
for you and choosing that.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
It's what protects you, it
inspires you and ultimately

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:90%
increases your radiance.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:84%
If you have a line 2
Radiance, then the best way

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
you can enhance your
health is through flow.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:90%
This is about being easygoing.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Line 2 doesn't need to
understand everything

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:90%
like line 1.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Line 2 is more
lazy in a good way.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:90%
It's effortless.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Line 2's Radiance
comes from intimacy,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:90%
from deep relational skills.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.600 align:middle line:84%
This is about not falling victim
to someone else's pressure

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
line 2 Radiance,

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:84%
there may be an area
where you're just

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.540 align:middle line:84%
naturally gifted without
needing to really study.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you are a spontaneous,
self-taught musician,

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
or you just have an uncanny
knack for something, some skill,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and you never really
had to try too hard.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're a line 2,
don't try too hard.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Do the things that flow for you.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
natural grace in life.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And you unlock your radiance
by choosing the effortless path

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.700 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:84%
If you have a line
3 Radiance, then one

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
of the most important ways
for you to keep healthy

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:84%
is through regular
exercise, dynamic exercise.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example,
Serena Williams.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:84%
She's a good example
of a line 3 Radiance.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.150 align:middle line:84%
She's someone who has to
work out regularly and move

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:84%
her body in a very dynamic
way to get the blood pumping

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and flowing through the system.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is radiant
health, through energy,

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
through vigorous exercise,
through fulfilling activity.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a line
3 Radiance, then

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:84%
make sure that you finish
your day with no energy left.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You increase your health
through spending your energy,

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:90%
not through saving it.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So you get to see perhaps
how each of these lines

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:84%
unlocks a lesson in
health for humanity.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Line 1, understanding.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Line 2, flow.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Line 3, exercise.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
If you have a line 4
Radiance, then for you,

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
health is all about
connectivity and the need

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:84%
to belong in a community and
feel the regular connection

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:90%
of people around you.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Oprah Winfrey is a good
example of a line 4 Radiance.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:84%
She's someone that needs to keep
that service moving and flowing

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:90%
in a community and in a culture.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
This is about meeting and
working with different people,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:84%
exploring diversity,
sharing your emotional life,

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:90%
being open-hearted.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:84%
These are often lives lived
in service or devotion

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:90%
to a cause or a group.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Line 4 really needs to feel a
sense of communal belonging.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
That's how line 4
lives a radiant life.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:84%
If you have a line
5 Radiance, then you

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:90%
are a great problem-solver.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
You need problems to solve and
you need to be helping others,

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.640 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps in a
different way from line 4.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much about community
for you, but practicality.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
You just want to
see things improve.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.300 align:middle line:84%
You need to feel you're
having an impact,

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
or be involved in a project
where you can have an impact.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Mother Teresa is a good
example of a line 5 Radiance.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
She needed problems to solve so
that she could keep on helping

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:90%
others in a wider way.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:84%
The highest expressions
of a line 5 Radiance

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
also can have a more
global impact that lives on

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:90%
long after they've gone.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're a line 6 Radiance,
then you need to have a vision

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and you need to be working
towards that vision.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And you need to have this sense
of being involved in something

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:90%
that's far bigger than you.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:10%
Alan Turing, the father
of the modern computer,

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:10%
is a good example of a line 6.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:90%
He had a big vision.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
He trusted in it, and then
he started building it,

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
knowing perhaps somewhere
deep inside himself

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that this would travel far
further after he was gone.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So in a line 6, you need to
get involved in something

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
that will far
outlive you and that

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:84%
will help the children
of future generations.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
That's how you
fulfill your radiance.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.740 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So there are the six
lines of Radiance,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:90%
the keystones of human health.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Line 1, understanding; line
2, flow; line 3, exercise;

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.700 align:middle line:84%
line 4, a sense of
community and belonging;

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
line 5, problems to solve
that have an impact;

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
line 6, a vision
that outlives you.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:84%
These are actually remarkably
similar to the metrics

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
they found in blue
zones, the places

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
where more people lived to
over 100 than anywhere else.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So pay special attention
to your line number

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
as it will really help
release your radiance.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to end by looking
at a few powerful, awakened

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:90%
radiant beings.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when
we see these people

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
or we see photographs
of them, we

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
can see the radiance
coming out of their eyes.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Or we may get a
sense that they've

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
experienced some of
the Siddhis or are

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:90%
manifesting ecstatic states.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's really good to look at
the radiance key in your profile

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and see what Siddhi
you have there,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:84%
because that
highest frequency is

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:84%
what you're here to ultimately
manifest in the world.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen Yogananda,
who was an illuminated being.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that he had
Gene Key 57 as his Radiance.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And the journey of Gene
Key 57 is from unease

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:90%
through intuition to clarity.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we can be
very grateful that he

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
battled that unease
early in his life

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and overcame it so that he could
find this intuitive awareness

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
right at the heart of his
being, which then led him

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
all the way on
his spiritual path

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
to an incredible clarity
of consciousness.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote about this
clarity in many of his books.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is his
Radiance as clarity.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:10%
Finally, this is another Indian
saint, Sri Anandamayi Ma,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.840 align:middle line:10%
and she has Gene Key 19
as her Radiance, which

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:10%
is the Siddhi of sacrifice.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:10%
So at the age of 3, she fell
into a spontaneous ecstasy

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:10%
that lasted the whole
length of her long life.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
That was the breakthrough
of her radiance.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And she gave her entire life
to serving others and helping

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
them cut through their egos
and make the ultimate sacrifice

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:84%
to surrender to the
evolutionary currents of grace.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And many people and a lot
of wealthy and famous people

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:90%
became her devotees.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So what does your Radiance
say about your inner light?

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
When you are in
the flow with life,

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:84%
feeling healthy, and vibrant,
what does this glow look

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:90%
like and feel like?

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're ever
feeling off, or you're

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:84%
out of sorts, or that your light
isn't really shining anymore,

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
remember the gift and the
Siddhi of your Radiance.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine
holding them softly

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
like a little candle
glowing within you.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:90%
This light hasn't gone out.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:84%
It's shines within your every
cell, and your breakdowns

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and your breakthroughs will
show you this light if you have

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.970 align:middle line:90%
the courage to go towards it.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So I hope this was
all inspiring for you.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:84%
It's vital to keep
contemplating your radiance

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and try to really bring
it into your life.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Not as some kind of
false showy holy thing,

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
but deep into your biology,
into the cells of your body,

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:90%
into your DNA.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So open up to the potential
of that inner light.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Open yourself up
to the potential

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:90%
of your own breakthrough.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And feel your radiance as
a quiet inner connection

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
through your heart and
into the ocean of love that

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.230 align:middle line:90%
lives inside each of us.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And remember these
simple words of Rumi,

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:84%
"love itself describes
its own perfection.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Be speechless and listen."

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Next time, we'll bring our
activation sequence to a close

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
by anchoring all this radiance
down into the form of our lives

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
as a sense of profound
and enduring purpose.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And we'll discover
the truth about how

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
we can really fulfill our
true higher purpose in life.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:90%
