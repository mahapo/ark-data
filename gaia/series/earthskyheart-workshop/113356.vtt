00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm here.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.920 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.350 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to change
subjects about this.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to come
back to all of this

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:90%
because we've just begun.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.811 align:middle line:84%
But once you have
that established.

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:29.060 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like the merkaba.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.434 align:middle line:84%
Once you have it
established, it's there.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And once you get this
established, it's there.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:90%
The rest of it's a lot easier.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.354 align:middle line:84%
But the subtleties--
this is easier

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:41.770 align:middle line:84%
than what we're about to do
because the subtleties of what

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.811 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
in the next couple days

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:84%
are hard to discover
for some people.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.786 align:middle line:90%
But you'll figure it out.

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.732 align:middle line:84%
So we're now going to talk about
programming of the merkaba.

00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's been in the
books and everything else

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:90%
But it's truly important.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's been so many
misunderstandings and mistakes

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and not really
realizing how it works,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
et cetera that I want to
get this crystal clear

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:90%
because it is very useful.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very useful.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Your merkaba can do things for
you to help you spiritually.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just like we
talked about yesterday

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.480 align:middle line:84%
when we were removing
entities from people and stuff

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.089 align:middle line:84%
You can use your merkaba
to seal this off.

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, once you do--
it just takes a moment.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:90%
And once you do, it's over.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what happens.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:84%
They cannot get inside
of you after that.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Or there's all kinds of
other things in the world

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.375 align:middle line:84%
that we'll talk about
in a little bit, were

00:01:56.375 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
there's just a 30-second
sentence to your merkaba,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:90%
it's over.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:90%
You won't have those problems.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.591 align:middle line:84%
And you're merkaba is going
to actually ultimately be

00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
the key that's going
to save you in what's

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.520 align:middle line:84%
about to come about because
the magnetic field, which we're

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
directly after this-- we are

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
at the point where the changes
are taking place, which

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
are a prelude to something
that we know what it means.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not in a
merkaba, you will not survive.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.986 align:middle line:90%
You can't make it without it.

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But you have to make a certain
program into your merkaba,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.685 align:middle line:84%
or the merkaba
won't work either.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually tell
your merkaba to something.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
this stuff for awhile.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And how many people
understand it

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
or feel like they understand
it, the programming part?

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.947 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:54.947 --> 00:02:57.030 align:middle line:84%
There was more that didn't
understand it than did,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.682 align:middle line:84%
We're down to two
pieces of paper.

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:10.574 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing that
is important to understand

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is that when someone establishes
a merkaba around themselves

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
or as a surrogate,
where you build--

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
or an external merkaba,
external to yourself.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:84%
When you set these things up, no
one in existence can change it.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
This is both a blessing
and a real problem

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:84%
sometimes that all
the stuff that's

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
going on the Bermuda
Triangle, which

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
is where you had seven
people create a merkaba field

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and then it went
out of control is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:84%
causing all kinds of problems,
not only here on Earth,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:84%
but other places because
it's as above, so below.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Everything's interconnected.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.627 align:middle line:84%
And that merkaba field, that was
the reason the Greys came here

00:04:08.627 --> 00:04:11.085 align:middle line:84%
in the first place was to try
to fix that sucker because it

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:13.001 align:middle line:84%
was causing so much
problems on their planets.

00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:90%
And they've tried everything.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And there is
nothing they can do.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:84%
They did do one thing that was--
I don't know how they did it.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But they finally got--
what happens in the Bermuda

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Triangle is whenever the
female gets stronger,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle line:84%
she starts going
faster than the male.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what I mean by stronger.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Then that's when the
distortions take place.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't
change the programming.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But they somehow influenced
the speed ratios.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.365 align:middle line:84%
And they keep the male
faster than the female.

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was in 1993.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
To my knowledge,
there has not been

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
any distortions in the
Bermuda Triangle since 1993.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:90%
If there is, I'm not aware of.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.398 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how they did it.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.651 align:middle line:84%
Really, I don't know
how they did it.

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:90%
But they did do it.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But usually, you
just have to know

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that when you set a program,
it's really easy for you

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.187 align:middle line:84%
to change it, but nobody
else touch it or move it.

00:05:17.187 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So to describe
programming of merkaba,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about crystals
because it is a crystal.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:90%
You are a crystal.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Your merkaba is a crystal.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:84%
It is a geometrical
relationship of energy,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
just like the same
thing that crystals do.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And they form very
specific patterns.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The energy field
that's around you

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the energy
field of creation itself.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And it has all possible
geometrical relationships

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
within it, without any
exceptions whatsoever.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:90%
It's all in there.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the total
package of everything.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.337 align:middle line:84%
It's basically when--
in the Bible, when

00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
it said God created
man in-- man was

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.108 align:middle line:84%
created in the image
of-- how do they say it?

00:06:13.108 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Man is created in
the image of God.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Man is created in
the image of God.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It didn't mean that
God looks like me

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:84%
or you because obviously,
we got black, white, green,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of people
and different appearances.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But it is the energy field
around us which is the image.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And that image is
the image, literally,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:84%
that every single thing in
existence was created through.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got enough
time, you could prove it.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:84%
It might take a while because
there's a lot of possibilities.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But the crystals have
tried to physically create

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.740 align:middle line:90%
every possibility.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.642 align:middle line:84%
And every year,
we find an average

00:06:55.642 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
of about six new
crystals that have never

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
been seen before, brand new
atomic structures no one's

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:84%
ever, ever, ever
seen on Earth before.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it's amazing that
they just keep coming up.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But there is a finite
number of these things.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
a crystal-- does

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
anybody have a quartz crystal
out there that-- a natural one

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:90%
that's not polished.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.868 align:middle line:84%
And you don't mind
if I touch it?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:90%
[WOMAN SPEAKING]

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Is this Yoda?

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.086 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:07:40.086 --> 00:07:43.348 align:middle line:90%

We were all safe.

00:07:53.174 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:90%

This is fine.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.978 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:01.978 --> 00:08:02.916 align:middle line:90%
Hi, little guy.

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
You've probably read
all kinds of books.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
conflicting ideas about crystals

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:90%
and what they are.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can just give you
my opinions on them.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.297 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
they're living beings.

00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:90%
They're alive.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:90%
They're conscious.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
They're aware of a lot, and
a lot of different levels

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:90%
that we're not aware of at all.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And they have sex.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:90%
There's males and female ones.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.065 align:middle line:84%
There's male,
female, and bisexual.

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:90%
This one is bisexual.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It's both male and
female at the same time.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.710 align:middle line:90%
You go to the lowest window.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the lowest window.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.409 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see the next
one's a little bit higher,

00:08:58.409 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:90%
next one's a little bit higher.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's a spiral
going that way.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.670 align:middle line:84%
But there's also another one
on this side, a little bit

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.836 align:middle line:90%
higher, a little bit higher.

00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you get a spiral
going the other way.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.305 align:middle line:84%
So you have a male and female
crystal at the same time.

00:09:11.305 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them will
just have one lower,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and it will just be one
spin in one direction

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and one spin in the
other direction.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:90%
It'll be just male or female.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they know
everything you're thinking.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
say anything to them.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:84%
All you have to
do is look at them

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:84%
or put your attention on them
and they can be on the moon

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:84%
or on the other side of
the world or anywhere.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
where they are.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you're familiar with
it, if you know that crystal,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:90%
they know you.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do is
tell it what you want it to do

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.517 align:middle line:90%
and it'll do it.

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:84%
It's really that simple
with your own merkaba.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
You just have to--
the only time you

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do a programming
is while you're doing this.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a good time because
you're stopping it and starting

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:90%
it and starting over again.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.185 align:middle line:90%
But any other time.

00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to think about

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.518 align:middle line:84%
whether it's sacred or
anything else like that.

00:10:07.518 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
You can be riding a bicycle,
eating an ice cream cone

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and tell your merkaba to
do something, and it will.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't talk
back or anything.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:90%
It just does it.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:90%
But there's other things.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is how many programs
can you put in there?

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Marcel Vogel, worked
with Bell Labs.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:90%
He was a brilliant person.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I met him right before he died.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one that
invented this floppy disk

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
for the beginning of computers,
of how memory things.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
He had over 200 major
patents in the world.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And he spent a lot
of time at the end

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.979 align:middle line:84%
of his life studying
crystals because he

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:90%
saw the same thing I did.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I did, too, for many years.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Long, long, long time I did
nothing but study crystals.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered
something that, when

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
he told me this-- actually, he
published it a journal-- that I

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.744 align:middle line:90%
didn't believe him.

00:11:10.744 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't believe him.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:90%
It just seemed so outrageous.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
He said that you can
only put as many programs

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
into a quartz crystal as
there are faces at the point.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.089 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, there's one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:23.380 align:middle line:90%
which is what there usually is.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:90%
But there's not always.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:90%
There's sometimes six.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
There's sometimes five,
sometimes three, seven.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It depends on where it was
grown and under what conditions.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:90%
But usually it's six.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:90%
It's hexagonal.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.815 align:middle line:84%
And so we did this
experiment with the equipment

00:11:43.815 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking
about awhile before.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:84%
We would focus in on
the crystal and turn it

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:90%
into the microwave range.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:90%
And we put up on the screen.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we could see the
whole microwave range.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, that screen
is invisible to me

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and to an operator over there.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:90%
And I can't see that.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I would telepathically
talk to this, not visually.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with sound,
so the operator

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what I was doing.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And I would put a
program into the crystal.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And really simple, just like
love, real simple program,

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:90%
not complex or anything.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.155 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter
how complex it was.

00:12:25.155 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It would still do
the same thing.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
The operator is watching the
microwave range over there.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, on
a very high range,

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
very, very super-short range
of the microwave, which

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:84%
is also very short
rayed anyway, there

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:90%
was a little blimp took place.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And so he moved that over,
blew that up, and said,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:90%
do that again.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And another blimp
came up over there.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And so we started testing it.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to confuse him, like
I would put three programs in,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.580 align:middle line:84%
take two out, and put two more
in, or something like that.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And he could tell
me exactly what

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I did because he could see,
bloomp, bloomp, bloomp, bloomp.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.954 align:middle line:90%
They'd be erased.

00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Then bloomp, bloomp, bloomp.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Then bloomp.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I was doing, he
could track right with me.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.560 align:middle line:90%
He would just write it down.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Say, well, what you did is you
put in two, you took out three.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:84%
You did this and you did-- And
he was right every single time.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
We got so fascinated with this
that we spent about five hours

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.150 align:middle line:90%
going through this whole thing.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:90%
But Marcel was right.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you get
to six programs,

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
if you try to put seven
in, no more blimps.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't accept any
more than that many.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But with the human crystal--
I was checking this

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to know if this
was true with human merkabas

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But I can't find a
limit on the merkaba.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't find it at all.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.094 align:middle line:84%
I could put 30, 40
programs in there.

00:13:53.094 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't matter.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.509 align:middle line:84%
They're all functioning
and working.

00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I've never been able to discover
what the relationship was.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:90%
But for sure it is true.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a limit on what you
can do with physical crystals

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and how many, though
each individual program

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:90%
can be very complex.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.755 align:middle line:84%
You can make a very
complex program

00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
that has many
different facets of it.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's one program.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And you put it in there.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Or you could just say
a word like "love,"

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.800 align:middle line:90%
and make it do that.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:90%
And it'll do that.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:90%
But that's all there is to it.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:90%
It's really that simple.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And erasing them,
it's the same way

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.167 align:middle line:84%
like there's books out there
that say to erase programs out

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:84%
of crystals, you have to
get them in the moonlight

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:84%
or you have to put
sage around them,

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:84%
or you have to put
them in the ocean.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
There's all these kind of
ideas and stuff like that.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just not true.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And scientifically,
we can prove it.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I can just look at the crystal
and say, erase all programs.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And right on the thing, it
will flat-line instantaneously.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do-- it's all
about intention, 100%, what you

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
do with these things
and the same thing

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
with your crystal
around you, the merkaba.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:90%
You put the program in.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:90%
It'll function.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.040 align:middle line:84%
It will do what you
say it's going to do.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The only exception to that
is if you're asking it to do

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
something that your higher
self, which is mommy-daddy,

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
kind of, thinks is not
good for you somehow,

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
or not safe or something,
because the higher self-- now,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:84%
that you made your merkaba,
that's the first thing that

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:90%
the merkaba does is--

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:84%
You've been sleeping
for a really long time.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Your field is not functioning.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And so your higher self, which
is just you on another level,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.570 align:middle line:84%
after maybe 1,000 years, it
goes, well, I'll just wait.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But the moment--
it's instantaneous--

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that your disc goes out
like that, your higher self

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:90%
goes, hmm, Johnny woke up.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And the attention goes
straight onto you.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:90%
They scan your entire life.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
They see every-- the
higher part of you

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
gets it all in a nanosecond and
then turns around immediately

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and starts changing
things in your life

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So how many of you first
did your merkaba and you

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
lost your job or a
lot of friends left

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
stuff like this?

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they look at
this and say, wow, here's

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
25 friends here that
are a bad influence.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.275 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:16:41.275 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Too much money in
this person's life.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.960 align:middle line:90%
You lose half your money.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Not enough in this one.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:90%
You win-- I don't know.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:90%
But they just make the changes.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And usually, in
the first 30 days,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
people go, wow, a lot
of things happened here.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
programming the merkaba,

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
there probably
are certain things

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:90%
that they won't let you do.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.555 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they are.

00:17:08.555 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:84%
They might let somebody
else do those things.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But they might not let you
do them for some reason.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you what it is.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:90%
But that's the only exception.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:90%
Other than that--

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
When I said that only you
can program your merkaba,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:90%
that is you.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:90%
It isn't somebody else.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.010 align:middle line:90%
It is you, literally.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And so your higher
self has the ability

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:90%
to program your merkaba also.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so outwardly,
it's very simple.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, you get into
it in a little more.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're slowly
beginning to see

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
what I'm talking about here in
terms of male and female ways

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:90%
of doing things.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
There are four ways that
you can program merkabas.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:01.560 align:middle line:84%
That's male, female, both,
and neutral, neither.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
four parameters

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:90%
that life evolves around.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's even in the DNA.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
You have the four nucleic acids.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And they actually represent
the male, female, both,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:90%
and neither aspect of it.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And they recombine
in sets of three,

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:90%
creating 64 different codons.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about that same
pattern that keeps coming up.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I just see it coming up over
and over and over and over.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
program the merkaba,

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:84%
you can program it
from a male point

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of view, which means it's
something you can write down

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:90%
on a piece of paper with steps.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
You say, you do this, this,
this, this, this, this.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.537 align:middle line:90%
And poof, this is what happens.

00:18:43.537 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can hand the
paper to somebody else.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.537 align:middle line:90%
And somebody can do it.

00:18:46.537 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be the same
no matter who does it.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It will have the same results.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But a female way
doesn't have logic.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't function through
mathematics or geometry.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It functions in
another kind of way.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
It's on the curved line,
not a straight line.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when she does it, if
she puts in a female program,

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
she can't tell anybody how to
do it because it probably will

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.290 align:middle line:90%
never do the same thing again.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.129 align:middle line:84%
Female program is constantly
morphing and changing.

00:19:28.129 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly changing.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like female
program, if you're

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to protect
yourself, she would just

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:90%
say, well, let God protect me.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, God can do anything.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The source of life
can do anything.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So now, the source of
life is protecting her.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it may
change the program.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's trying
to interfere somehow

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:84%
or trying to hurt
her somehow, it

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:90%
will just change the program.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And the moment they try
to alter their program

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.895 align:middle line:84%
to adapt your program,
they'll change it again

00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:90%
to something else.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.605 align:middle line:84%
And who knows what
is going to be?

00:20:05.605 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:84%
They could change
it to anything.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that steps of
change and how it works

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:90%
will maybe never occur again.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very difficult
if not close to impossible

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:90%
to beat a female program.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I know Russia,
the United States,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.936 align:middle line:84%
we're in a sparring match
for a long time, psychically.

00:20:24.936 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You may remember
back in the days

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
when they were attacking each
other's embassies and things

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:90%
psychically.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.034 align:middle line:84%
And that went on for a
long time until one of them

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
discovered the
female programming.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And the other one discovered
it right directly after that

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and kind of ended it
because once they both get

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.540 align:middle line:90%
into that, well, now what do.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.015 align:middle line:90%
And it's all just ideas.

00:20:54.015 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's the thing about-- the
female program is different.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
You can't write
a piece of paper.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You can't give it
to somebody else

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and it will do the same thing.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:90%
But you can use both at once.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:84%
You can run both male
programs and female programs

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously in the same
merkaba or the same crystal,

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't run very
many programs. .

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I only have a few because I
feel like I need to have them,

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:90%
so I do them.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.099 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one is the
highest form of programming,

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:90%
which is not programming.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:90%
You just simply don't program.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
It's from the ancient Chinese
way of perceiving things.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The greatest armor is nakedness,
is total vulnerability.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest
armor in existence.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's based upon
the understanding

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that you and the
source of life are one.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And life is whole, complete,
and perfect exactly as it is.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing wrong.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
It is evolving in precisely the
way that it's supposed to go.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.785 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
know that, you don't

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
have to get involved
with programming at all.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:36.004 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same way with--
in psychics' abilities,

00:22:36.004 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:90%
it's the same kind of thing.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
There are male
psychic abilities,

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
female psychic abilities,
both, and neither.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
The neither ones,
you don't have to.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:90%
You just know the answer.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.259 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're trying to
do, you just know what it is.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Like there's Chinese
kids out there,

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and they were
trying to understand

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.260 align:middle line:84%
them, who are faster
than the fastest

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:90%
supercomputers in the world.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
They give calculus problems
that take supercomputers

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.970 align:middle line:90%
a half an hour to figure out.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And so here's a little kid
that's like, eight, years old.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And they give him this
unbelievable program.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:90%
And they say, OK, go for it.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And now the computer
goes-- [BUZZES]

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And he just writes the
answer on the board,

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
just instantaneously
writes it out.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in the middle
because they just know.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And this is where we're going.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:90%
But we're not all there yet.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But there are human beings
that can demonstrate this.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So to go back to male
programming, male programming,

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:84%
when I first started doing
this, the US military

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
became very afraid of what I
was doing in the beginning.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand
what it was.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.872 align:middle line:84%
And almost everybody that
came through my workshop,

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:84%
when they would leave,
they go back home.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And black helicopters would just
be circling them and projecting

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fields into
them for various reasons

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to try and understand what
was happening in various ways.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost everybody,
almost practically

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
every single person
that went through.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.315 align:middle line:84%
This was in the beginning,
in the '90s and in there.

00:24:21.315 --> 00:24:24.339 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And they would interfere
with my workshops.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.088 align:middle line:84%
They would wait until I
got my workshops going.

00:24:28.088 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as everybody
popped their disk out,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
man, within 15 minutes,
they were all over us,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:90%
every single time.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I just made a little
tiny program in there.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to stop what they
were doing because I don't have

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:90%
any problem with US military.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:84%
But I just didn't want
them to interfere with me.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So I just simply put
a program in that

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.510 align:middle line:84%
says that, my field-- I
would set up a huge surrogate

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
or external field that
would surround everything,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:84%
which would enclose
everybody's fields.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd just put that
the field was invisible,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:90%
untraceable, and undetectable.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I go off all their screens.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:90%
They can't find me.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:90%
They don't know where I am.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like
I don't exist.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what they
do, they can't find me.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was only doing that
so they wouldn't interfere

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and so I could give a class
without their interference.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:90%
And it worked perfect.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:90%
It will always work perfect.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I have a much better
relationship with them now.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, they tried
to kill me a whole bunch.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And none of it worked.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.041 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't figure out
why they couldn't kill me.

00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And so then they finally
decided that they

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:90%
were going to join me.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up with a class
full of military people, all

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.484 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:54.484 --> 00:25:55.942 align:middle line:90%
[MAN SPEAKING]

00:25:55.942 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>What did they do
to try to kill you?

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>They used airplanes,
all kinds of things.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:84%
They went to war
against me at one point.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was my fault. It
wasn't their fault. I admit.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.816 align:middle line:84%
It was my fault because
I got mad for a second.

00:26:13.816 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have done that.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:90%
They came in.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And I owned 160-acre place
over here not far away.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a conference center
that would sleep 55 people.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
nice place that we had.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.306 align:middle line:84%
And it was given to
me as a gift, which

00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
when I was done with it, I
gave it back to them because I

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:90%
didn't need it anymore.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
But while we were there--
what was it that happened?

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
They started interfering
with my workshop.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:84%
They came in-- that's what it
was-- with their helicopters,

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.360 align:middle line:90%
these four helicopters.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.955 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't
leave for a while.

00:27:00.955 --> 00:27:05.320 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.975 align:middle line:84%
After about 15
times of doing this,

00:27:07.975 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I just psychically
traced up to one of them,

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.369 align:middle line:84%
traced back to who the commander
that gave them the order,

00:27:15.369 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:84%
went back further, kept
going back through.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself in
NORAD in Colorado.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And I went down, right into
the Earth through the channels.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.084 align:middle line:90%
It set off all these alarms.

00:27:26.084 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And I went right in
the main controller.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.165 align:middle line:84%
And there's about seven
or eight generals sitting

00:27:29.165 --> 00:27:30.546 align:middle line:90%
there, all these people.

00:27:30.546 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
freaked because they

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:90%
could see me somehow.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:90%
They got some kind of thing.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.551 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And they knew I was there.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.767 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going up
to one and saying, OK,

00:27:39.767 --> 00:27:41.016 align:middle line:90%
are you the guy that did this?

00:27:41.016 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And he says, no, no.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.365 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up sending
me all away to Bill Clinton.

00:27:45.365 --> 00:27:48.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's going, well, I
didn't understand exactly.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.398 align:middle line:90%
Or something like that.

00:27:52.398 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, after that.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:90%
they just-- holy cow.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:84%
They sent in four helicopters
that parked themselves

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.870 align:middle line:84%
over our land and
would not leave

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:07.960 align:middle line:90%
until they ran out of gas.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And four more
would replace them.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And they put all
these instruments

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
all around our installation
and the mountains around us.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they came
in with these jets

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
that I photographed and
sent to someone that I

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:90%
know that knows these things.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.627 align:middle line:84%
And he says that those
particular jets are nowhere.

00:28:26.627 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
where they came from.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:90%
But he says they're so rare.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And they have psychic
instruments inside of them.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:84%
They were used in
the Desert Storm.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you noticed
in the Desert Storm,

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.590 align:middle line:84%
the enemy just became
afraid, super fear.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
They just gave up
and everything.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't because
they became afraid.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:84%
It was because we
made them afraid.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.927 align:middle line:84%
It was through this
waveform technology

00:28:54.927 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:84%
that they were just
developing at that time.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.301 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:28:57.301 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
applying that on us.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is that
they missed me by a day.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:90%
My group had left.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Another group had come in.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And the group that
had come in were

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:90%
just these innocent people.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:90%
And they were so confused.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
They were walking
around out in the desert

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.466 align:middle line:84%
with their
toothbrushes, mumbling.

00:29:21.466 --> 00:29:23.530 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know their
names or anything.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a long story.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But I've been
through this enough.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.995 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they finally
came and approached me

00:29:32.995 --> 00:29:33.495 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:29:33.495 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:90%
And we had long conversations.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And what set them
off so much afraid

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.210 align:middle line:84%
was from their
satellites-- you may not

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:84%
know this-- but one person,
one single individual--

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and they told me this--
puts out approximately

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.610 align:middle line:84%
the same amount of energy as
a city of about 15,000 people,

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:90%
the entire city.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And they could see
you walking around.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.840 align:middle line:84%
You make a very bright
light on the ground

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.270 align:middle line:84%
when you're moving around
from the satellites.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>From your merkaba?

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:05.897 align:middle line:90%
>>From your merkaba, yes.

00:30:05.897 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:84%
They know when you're
in your merkaba.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.302 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.302 --> 00:30:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting to see
these all over the world.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.619 align:middle line:84%
And then they started fearing,
well, if a person puts out

00:30:15.619 --> 00:30:16.910 align:middle line:90%
this much energy, who are they?

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.934 align:middle line:90%
And what does this mean?

00:30:18.934 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's when they all
came to a workshop and said,

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.080 align:middle line:84%
you've got to tell
us what you're doing.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.700 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:90%
There's these beams of light.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
You breathe this way.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.110 align:middle line:90%
You do this.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.670 align:middle line:90%
And they took it serious.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted them
to take it serious.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against my country.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they
eventually came in.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And once they
understood it, they even

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:84%
set up a special thing at
Kirkland Air Force Base

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.830 align:middle line:84%
just for this kind
of understanding.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And where they've
taken it, I don't know.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:02.450 align:middle line:84%
You can use this all you want
in military as long as you

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:90%
don't use it offensively.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.460 align:middle line:90%
You can only use it defensively.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:84%
You can use your merkaba
to protect yourself.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But you can't kill
anybody with it

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.150 align:middle line:90%
because then you kill the love.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:90%
And the whole thing dies.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.511 align:middle line:84%
Russia, and I've been right
in the midst of Russia,

00:31:18.511 --> 00:31:19.260 align:middle line:90%
in the government.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:84%
The government
pulled me right in.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.630 align:middle line:84%
All five levels of the KGB have
been to the flower of life.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.250 align:middle line:90%
All the heads of them.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.289 align:middle line:84%
And Putin was very
aware of all this.

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't go
through one of them.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But he was very much
in support of it.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:84%
When I went over there, they
watched everything I was doing.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:84%
They eventually brought
me into the Kremlin.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I was brought right before the
National Academy of Sciences

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:90%
for Moscow.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Was introduced to all of them.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:90%
There's four men and four women.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.264 align:middle line:84%
And then the women are
just pure psychics.

00:31:54.264 --> 00:31:54.930 align:middle line:90%
So they came up.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were
scanning me all over

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.936 align:middle line:84%
and going in and looking in deep
and all these different levels.

00:31:58.936 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they said,
OK, yeah, he's OK.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.930 align:middle line:84%
He's not here to
kill us or anything.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And they presented to me
their secret knowledge

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:90%
of their military.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Their military defense system is
100% based on merkaba science.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that anybody
in the world could beat them.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:84%
If you attacked them,
I don't think you

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.630 align:middle line:90%
could beat them at this point.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.088 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
would be possible.

00:32:26.088 --> 00:32:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:32.680 align:middle line:90%
And they were very good.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I really want a relationship
between the United States

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and Russia.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be very
important for the world

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:84%
if we could ever
get to be friends.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And I hope this
happens some day.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
There's still a lot of
suspicion in Russia for us.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.980 align:middle line:90%
And for good reason.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we haven't
been very nice

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.526 align:middle line:90%
in the world in a lot of ways.

00:32:54.526 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>I guess I'm just wondering
how militarily-minded people

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and people that
are-- they do attack

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and they are killing people
and things like that.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:84%
How do they find the divine
love to actually experience

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:90%
the merkaba?

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.815 align:middle line:84%
It just seems a
little contradictory.

00:33:15.815 --> 00:33:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I know.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, the people
that went to this, there

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.670 align:middle line:84%
was nobody under a major that
went in there, not one person.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.090 align:middle line:90%
A major was the lowest one.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And there were no
generals, either, though.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:84%
They were all in between major
and colonel and all that.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.725 align:middle line:90%
And most of them were female.

00:33:35.725 --> 00:33:38.230 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were people
who were really

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:49.270 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
ways of looking at war.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they were looking at
protecting the United States.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But they were
looking at other ways

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.620 align:middle line:84%
than the normal ways of
trying to understand things.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were
seriously doing this.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Where they have taken
it at this point,

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not exactly
sure because I have

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot of friends that have
been taken in by the military.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:90%
And Navy is the worst of all.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.980 align:middle line:90%
And this was the Air Force.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force, I prefer
them over any other ones.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And exactly how they're
applying this, I don't know.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Or if they even if
they are applying it.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
are mostly trying

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.550 align:middle line:84%
to understand it
more than anything

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.104 align:middle line:84%
because they can
see what's going on.

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:34.479 align:middle line:84%
And they all had
a lot of success

00:34:34.479 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:84%
with getting their
merkaba fields going?

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Or you're not sure about that?

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know
about all of them.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But I do know some
of them I stayed

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.310 align:middle line:84%
with for a couple
years, especially

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:90%
this one woman who was a major.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And she was very good at it.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:90%
She understood it.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.199 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted them
to understand it.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So they understood that this
was not a threat to the United

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.670 align:middle line:90%
States or to the world.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just a natural
process of evolution,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness rising
up to another level.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And so if they really
want to protect

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:84%
the security of the world
and the United States,

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:84%
they need to understand
what's happening

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and not go into fear
over it, but just

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:84%
understand it so they
can see what is a threat

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.592 align:middle line:90%
and what is not a threat.

00:35:22.592 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I
believe they fully

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:90%
understand it's not a threat.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And they also understand
what is evolving right now

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.010 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the Earth changes.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.670 align:middle line:90%
They're no dummies.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.359 align:middle line:84%
They have a very good
understanding of what it is.

00:35:40.359 --> 00:35:42.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how to deal
with a lot of these things.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.649 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just what's going
with the solar flares,

00:35:44.649 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:84%
which I want to talk
about right now.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got the entire
world on a red alert because

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.210 align:middle line:90%
of this right now.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The whole world is freaked
out because right now,

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.550 align:middle line:84%
according to NASA, we have
two years left, period.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And the whole entire
world is going

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to break apart on
every single level

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:84%
that we know, from financial
to everything, absolutely

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're rapidly
trying to find answers.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answers lie
in this because a lot

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.570 align:middle line:84%
of the stuff that
is about to happen,

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:90%
you can't solve technologically.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to solve
with inner technology.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
know what this is

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.590 align:middle line:90%
or they're not going to make it.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:84%
If they rely totally
on technology,

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that technology--
the sun is about the

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:39.940 align:middle line:84%
wipe off technology right
off the face of the Earth.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:45.300 align:middle line:84%
NASA just now said, every single
computer on Earth by-- well,

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:90%
you could protect it.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.430 align:middle line:84%
With Faraday cages, you
might be able to protect

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:90%
some information and stuff.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.290 align:middle line:90%
And they're trying to find ways.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But what they've announced
to the world, what

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.800 align:middle line:84%
NASA has announced,
and so has the UK

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
announced, that by
2013, the solar flares

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.020 align:middle line:84%
are going to be so great that
they're going to blow out

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.300 align:middle line:90%
all of our technology.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Every single computer
disk in the world

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.740 align:middle line:90%
is going to be erased.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Just think about it.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] There'll be no money.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.630 align:middle line:90%
There'll be no electricity.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:90%
There'll be no water.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:90%
There'll be no food.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.630 align:middle line:90%
There'll be no nothing.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.210 align:middle line:84%
You'll be on your
own in your house.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it stands
right now as of this minute,

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:84%
unless they can
figure out what to do.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.290 align:middle line:90%
We know what to do.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.570 align:middle line:90%
We know exactly what to do.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But how do you get seven
billion people to do it?

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.448 align:middle line:90%
Not likely.

00:37:40.448 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:90%
[MAN SPEAKING]

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the merkaba will
keep you alive during all

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:53.960 align:middle line:84%
of this because if you
program the merkaba,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.080 align:middle line:84%
if the magnetic field
were to go to zero,

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:84%
which every geomagnetic
scientist on Earth believes

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.294 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen very
soon and that the poles are

00:38:02.294 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:90%
going to reverse themselves.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.001 align:middle line:84%
When they reverse, when north
becomes south and south becomes

00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:84%
north, there's a period of
time when it goes to zero.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is the time-- that's
what happened in Atlantis.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And when it did, it erased the
memory of every single person

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:19.794 align:middle line:84%
there, except for
a certain group

00:38:19.794 --> 00:38:22.210 align:middle line:84%
of people, which were called
[INAUDIBLE] because they knew

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff, and the
ascended masters, which they're

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.730 align:middle line:90%
beyond even knowing this stuff.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody just
lost their memory.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:90%
They all died.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Very few survived this.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were right back
to, how do you make fire.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.670 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even
know what fire was.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you wouldn't be
able to get out of this room

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.990 align:middle line:84%
because you wouldn't
know what a door was.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't know
what human meant.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Your memory is
retained by magnetics,

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.880 align:middle line:90%
very much like a disk.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And around every
brain cell, there's

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:90%
a magnetic sheath around there.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.279 align:middle line:84%
And your memory is
literally stored in a way

00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:05.820 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
quite understand yet.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.150 align:middle line:90%
It's stored in space.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:12.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
memory stored out

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:17.440 align:middle line:84%
millions of miles away,
not even in their bodies.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And it can be stored internally,
equivalent to millions

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.210 align:middle line:90%
of miles away.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:21.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's small.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.650 align:middle line:90%


00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of things
that they don't yet.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that we
will get this in time,

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
that no, probably the
whole world is not

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.260 align:middle line:90%
going to figure this out.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:84%
But there's going to be
enough people, whatever

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:42.410 align:middle line:84%
that amount is, for us
all to keep humanity alive

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and to go forth and go on.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:47.777 align:middle line:90%


00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I would like to see every
single last person go through.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:90%
I hope that's true.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, this
is probably not true.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.514 align:middle line:84%
But if they die, they
still won't be harmed.

00:39:59.514 --> 00:40:01.930 align:middle line:84%
You have three things that can
to happen to you right now.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.304 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
fourth thing that's

00:40:03.304 --> 00:40:04.580 align:middle line:90%
about to appear on Earth.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.475 align:middle line:84%
Nobody on Earth
knows about it yet.

00:40:06.475 --> 00:40:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:09.859 align:middle line:90%
You can die.

00:40:09.859 --> 00:40:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, you're going
to go through normal death.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to end
up in three overtones

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.590 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension.

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It's either the 10th,
11th or 12th overtone

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.100 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you die,
you're going to end up

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.120 align:middle line:84%
in the 10th overtone of
the fourth dimension.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you go
through resurrection,

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
where you die and then
after, as you're dying

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.707 align:middle line:84%
and you're still in your body,
then you reconstruct your body

00:40:34.707 --> 00:40:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and bring it with you because
that's what you have to do

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:90%
is bring your body with you.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:84%
This is what's important,
this physical body.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the key to
higher consciousness.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.535 align:middle line:84%
You might not think
so, but it is.

00:40:48.535 --> 00:40:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter what
kind of condition it's in.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.687 align:middle line:84%
It could be missing
arms and legs

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and broken up and in the
wheelchair and everything else.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:40:59.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:84%
If it's got a beating
heart, you're fine.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you can go through
resurrection, which

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.880 align:middle line:90%
was demonstrated by Jesus.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's a possibility.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.927 align:middle line:84%
Or you can go through ascension,
where you don't actually die.

00:41:15.927 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:84%
You come to a place where you
understand all this stuff.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:18.959 align:middle line:90%
You got it down.

00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:19.500 align:middle line:90%
You sit down.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.740 align:middle line:84%
You say, OK, I've decided
that I'm going leave.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:90%
You take the 18th breath, poof.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
You actually disappear right
before somebody's eyes.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And you take the body directly,
without going through the death

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.880 align:middle line:90%
process in the normal way.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a fourth way
that's about to emerge.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of excited
about it actually.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's ever done before.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.947 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what it is.

00:41:42.947 --> 00:41:45.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But I know it's
here because the two

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:52.210 align:middle line:84%
ways of resurrection
and ascension

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:56.140 align:middle line:84%
are actually
connected to alchemy.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And in alchemy, there
have been two ways

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.460 align:middle line:90%
that you can create gold.

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is through lead into
gold or mercury into gold.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.040 align:middle line:90%
They're both very toxic ways.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:90%
They're not very safe to do.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They have certain problems
associated with them.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:90%
But they work.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And on the fifth day, we'll talk
about what that actually means

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.570 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But a new way has just emerged
in the last few months.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:31.720 align:middle line:84%
You can turn silicon
into gold, crystal.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't toxic.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:36.230 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely clean.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
any of the problems

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.010 align:middle line:90%
that everything else has.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing it right
here in Sedona right now.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.969 align:middle line:84%
And so I know it's possible
because we're actually holding

00:42:46.969 --> 00:42:48.260 align:middle line:90%
gold in our hand from doing it.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We're taking this and
coming up with gold.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.769 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm trying to do is
when we get to the final point,

00:42:55.769 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:84%
because we've been doing
research and development

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.320 align:middle line:84%
on better and better
and better ways.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.028 align:middle line:84%
And we've finally got
it down to this one

00:43:01.028 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:84%
way that's so clean and easy
and fast that it's amazing.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.870 align:middle line:90%
And I don't care about the gold.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in the
chemical reaction that

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:84%
moves through it because
that approximates

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.820 align:middle line:84%
how human consciousness
goes to go to higher

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.280 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.901 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel that
very soon-- and I

00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:84%
feel this will probably be in
the next three or four months,

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.860 align:middle line:84%
that soon-- we will have a whole
new way, another way of getting

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.900 align:middle line:84%
into higher consciousness,
separate from all

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.990 align:middle line:84%
these other-- different than
resurrection and ascension,

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.680 align:middle line:90%
another way.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.370 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:37.620 align:middle line:90%
It's either true or not true.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:90%
We'll find out.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.514 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, this
part of it is true.

00:43:42.514 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Can I protect my daughter
of two years old on my merkaba

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.130 align:middle line:90%
during the shift?

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.675 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:43:49.675 --> 00:43:50.175 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah?

00:43:50.175 --> 00:43:54.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:59.129 align:middle line:84%
>>It's illegal to activate
someone else's merkaba field

00:43:59.129 --> 00:44:00.920 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universe,
really, because it

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.660 align:middle line:90%
influences their evolution.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So as you do that to
somebody, they rapidly--

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.570 align:middle line:84%
whether you guys
realize it or not,

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.310 align:middle line:84%
you're growing really
fast right now.

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Your evolutionary
speed is not normal.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.110 align:middle line:90%
You're moving really fast.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.830 align:middle line:90%
You're evolving fast.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And with what you're
about to learn

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and what you're about to do
over the next couple days,

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.234 align:middle line:84%
and you start taking that,
you're even going to go faster.

00:44:29.234 --> 00:44:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Things are going to
become really clear to you

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:32.120 align:middle line:90%
in all kinds of ways.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:40.590 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It's illegal for people
to come from other places.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Like ET's can come
here and mess with us.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Though there have
been so many people

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:84%
that have broken the
laws with humanity.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:56.295 align:middle line:84%
We have been screwed with
for thousands of years.

00:44:56.295 --> 00:44:58.980 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.940 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, oh, it's OK.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.694 align:middle line:90%
It's just the humans.

00:45:01.694 --> 00:45:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever you want.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But you're not supposed
to do that stuff.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:11.025 align:middle line:84%
And one of the laws is you
can't activate someone's merkaba

00:45:11.025 --> 00:45:13.050 align:middle line:84%
field until they
do it naturally.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.870 align:middle line:84%
However, the one exception
is that if you're

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.360 align:middle line:84%
a mother or a father
and you have children

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a life or death
situation, you can do it.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.460 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it to someone
you don't know, another kid

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:24.950 align:middle line:90%
that you don't know.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:25.720 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But you can protect
your own family.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the one exception.

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But it does have an
influence on them

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:37.040 align:middle line:90%
that will never, never go away.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's a-- you've
got to really consider it

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:45.830 align:middle line:84%
because that might influence
them in a way that might not

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.330 align:middle line:90%
be positive.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to say
once you do that.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>How old would you
recommend the children

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.090 align:middle line:84%
be before you actually
teach them how to do this?

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.715 align:middle line:84%
At what point do you
think that they're

00:45:57.715 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:90%
mature enough to handle it?

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, first of all,
this is synthetic.

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:09.160 align:middle line:84%
If you go back through
humankind, no one taught this.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Like what we're doing right now,
it's never been done before.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:18.650 align:middle line:84%
We arrived at it during Atlantis
time, through natural means,

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.790 align:middle line:84%
not through-- in other
words, if you just

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.560 align:middle line:84%
start a race on a
planet, those people

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.650 align:middle line:84%
are going to figure this
stuff out on their own

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.250 align:middle line:90%
without anybody helping them.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to usually take
about 150,000 to 200,000 years.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.880 align:middle line:90%
And they will get it.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.100 align:middle line:84%
The only reason we've been
allowed to do this with you,

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:43.120 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing right now, is
because we had obtained this.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.550 align:middle line:84%
A small portion of us
had attained that level

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:48.070 align:middle line:90%
once before.

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And because we had
attained it before,

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.040 align:middle line:84%
we were able to get permission
from Galactic Center

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.446 align:middle line:90%
to synthetically do this.

00:46:54.446 --> 00:46:56.280 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't usually work out.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, it works about
roughly half the time.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And half the time,
it doesn't work.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's worked.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:06.000 align:middle line:90%
It's already worked.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.750 align:middle line:84%
We are definitely going to
make it all the way, for sure.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.020 align:middle line:90%
It's already happened.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part of
the human race that

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.210 align:middle line:90%
has already made it through.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
the Ascended Masters.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But still, it's
about 8,000 people.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:24.140 align:middle line:84%
If nobody else made it through,
human kind has made through.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.385 align:middle line:90%
>>Are they physical?

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:28.773 align:middle line:84%
>>The Ascended Masters,
there's only a few

00:47:28.773 --> 00:47:31.280 align:middle line:90%
of them that are physical.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Out of the 8,000, I
think there's about 10

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:34.656 align:middle line:90%
of them that can.

00:47:34.656 --> 00:47:35.780 align:middle line:90%
And they go back and forth.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.184 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.184 --> 00:47:39.975 align:middle line:84%
They can drop down from
the sixth dimension

00:47:39.975 --> 00:47:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and get into the fourth, and
then with great understanding,

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.410 align:middle line:90%
create a physical body.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of them.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Like St. Germaine is
back on Earth right now.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.297 align:middle line:84%
And there's a few
others that are probably

00:47:55.297 --> 00:47:57.630 align:middle line:84%
going to start teaching or
whatever they're going to do.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they're going to.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Saint Germaine said that he's
going to use his influence.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.680 align:middle line:90%
He's the richest man on Earth.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.110 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody even close.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:15.937 align:middle line:84%
And so he has this plan
having to do with finances

00:48:15.937 --> 00:48:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and what he's going to do.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
that is, exactly.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.965 align:middle line:84%
If I did know, I
wouldn't talk about it.

00:48:19.965 --> 00:48:21.006 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know exactly.

00:48:21.006 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:90%


00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what that
means, why he's doing that.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there are people that
are physical, but very few

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.170 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Most people, when they go
into the fourth dimension,

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:35.440 align:middle line:90%
you can come back to the third.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But once you go higher than
that and you become formless,

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:46.892 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to
take form on again.

00:48:46.892 --> 00:48:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
saying, well, I'm

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:49.950 align:middle line:90%
going to become a baby again.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:52.310 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard to do.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And so it's not likely.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>So as far as the
kids are concerned,

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:06.200 align:middle line:84%
as a follow up to her question,
if we activate our children's

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.860 align:middle line:84%
merkaba, is that something
we do as a surrogate?

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Or we do the breathing for them?

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Do we teach them how to do it?

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>It depends on what
level you're on.

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're between
one and two years,

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.980 align:middle line:84%
you have to do it
through this method.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And you would have to
do it like a surrogate

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:26.520 align:middle line:84%
or an external merkaba, only
using them at their breathing

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.225 align:middle line:90%
tube as the means.

00:49:29.225 --> 00:49:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.206 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
question for sure.

00:49:35.206 --> 00:49:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to
say, you could even

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.250 align:middle line:90%
program their merkaba for them.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:42.890 align:middle line:90%
But I actually don't know.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:46.310 align:middle line:90%
That may not be true. .

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:51.300 align:middle line:84%
You might have to tell
them what to do or say.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is don't
worry about your kids.

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.740 align:middle line:84%
If you've got to
worry about anybody,

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.482 align:middle line:84%
worry about yourself and any
adults, your husband or et

00:50:01.482 --> 00:50:02.690 align:middle line:90%
cetera, those kind of things.

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.070 align:middle line:90%
But the children are fine.

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.590 align:middle line:84%
If they're under
puberty, they're fine.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.450 align:middle line:84%
The moment this energy
starts coming up

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and they start feeling
it, they'll remember.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>They'll remember.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>They'll remember and go,
oh, yeah, I know what to do.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.070 align:middle line:84%
You could learn more from
them during that time

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:22.200 align:middle line:90%
than they can learn from you.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>Does the merkaba actually
maintain the magnetic field

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:29.960 align:middle line:84%
inside of it so we
don't lose our memory?

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>It will not do that
unless you program it.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it is a
program that I really

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:39.570 align:middle line:84%
recommend that you put
into your merkaba now.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is that if the
magnetic fields ever go to zero,

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:47.950 align:middle line:84%
then your merkaba
will approximate

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:52.610 align:middle line:90%
the Earth's magnetic field.

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to be flowing
through your body, which

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.160 align:middle line:90%
this could do.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And if it does that,
you won't even feel it.

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:05.984 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else will be
feeling it and going through

00:51:05.984 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:90%
all the symptoms and things.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.921 align:middle line:90%
But you will be normal.

00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:10.920 align:middle line:90%
You won't know anything.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:16.365 align:middle line:90%


00:51:16.365 --> 00:51:20.646 align:middle line:84%
>>What about animals and
other races on the planet?

00:51:20.646 --> 00:51:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Hmm?

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>How about the animals?

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>No problem with it.

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.690 align:middle line:84%
The only life form on Earth
that we have a problem with

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.970 align:middle line:90%
is humans.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:33.500 align:middle line:84%
There's no problem with
the rest of life, not any.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Great, great.

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.598 align:middle line:84%
>>They all know
exactly what to do.

00:51:35.598 --> 00:51:38.090 align:middle line:90%


00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, even the
ones that go extinct,

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.290 align:middle line:90%
they're not really extinct.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.500 align:middle line:84%
They just went
fourth dimensional.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.590 align:middle line:84%
They're there on another
level of existence.

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:48.985 align:middle line:90%
They just can't be here.

00:51:48.985 --> 00:51:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And maybe someday, they
may want to come back here.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.330 align:middle line:90%
The potential is still there.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:57.030 align:middle line:90%
But they're fine too.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And we've had a lot.

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had 30
million species on Earth

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:04.130 align:middle line:90%
in the year 1900, approximately.

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:06.600 align:middle line:90%
We got about 15 million now.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.500 align:middle line:84%
If you were coming from
space looking at Earth,

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.060 align:middle line:90%
you would say it is dying.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.870 align:middle line:90%


00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:18.740 align:middle line:84%
It took hundreds and
hundreds of millions

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.610 align:middle line:84%
of years for these life
forms to be developed.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And it took a less than
about 100-and-something years

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.570 align:middle line:90%
to kill it.

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:26.410 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:30.252 align:middle line:84%
And it's still dying
really, really fast.

00:52:30.252 --> 00:52:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people
that say there's

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.830 align:middle line:84%
no environmental
problem, it's like--

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:37.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking
around themselves.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's huge.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you sense that
the solar flare

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:49.430 align:middle line:84%
problem or the
polar shift problem

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:51.940 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen before
the fourth dimensional shift?

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible the Earth will
just shift to save humanity?

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.740 align:middle line:90%
So we avoid all that.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean, right now you have
many things going on at once.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Environmentally,
we are to a point

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:10.050 align:middle line:84%
where there could be a shift
within 72 hours to an ice age

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:10.880 align:middle line:90%
any second.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, it's
down to the ocean currents.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're breaking
apart right now.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:24.730 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the Gulf Stream,
it's changing shape now.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.860 align:middle line:90%
That's the final step.

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:32.510 align:middle line:84%
When it starts changing
shape, you got a problem.

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:35.690 align:middle line:90%
And that is the final step.

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:39.110 align:middle line:84%
When that goes through, then
the very next thing that

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:46.330 align:middle line:84%
happens after that as that you
have-- literally, in 72 hours,

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.880 align:middle line:90%
the clouds back over the sky.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And you don't see the sun again
for 90,000 years, not even

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:53.670 align:middle line:90%
for a minute.

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So the thing about the
day after tomorrow,

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:57.710 align:middle line:90%
it's a bunch of garbage.

00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:59.040 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it's true.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that this
big superstorm went away

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and everything's beautiful and
we're back together again, no,

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:05.570 align:middle line:90%
that's not what happens.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:08.770 align:middle line:84%
That's not the
scientific evidence.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:11.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the
sun again for 90,000.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.470 align:middle line:90%
That's an average.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.462 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's as
much as 120,000,

00:54:14.462 --> 00:54:18.220 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a little shorter, but
it averages at 90,000 years.

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And the average temperature
is 50 below zero.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.440 align:middle line:90%
That's average.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.020 align:middle line:84%
The only place you
can really live

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:32.130 align:middle line:84%
is right around the
equator, pretty much,

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to stay alive, unless you
use psychic energy, which

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:40.590 align:middle line:90%
was what was done in Helsinki.

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
guys know what's

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:45.350 align:middle line:90%
going on there in Finland.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's pretty
extraordinary, what

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.110 align:middle line:84%
they have been doing for a
long, long, long, long time

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:54.270 align:middle line:84%
because these ice ages
go are consistent.

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:56.820 align:middle line:84%
You have an average of
90,000 years ice age,

00:54:56.820 --> 00:55:00.870 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years of warmth,
90,000 years of ice age,

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:02.690 align:middle line:90%
10,000 years of warmth.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And we've had 10,000
years of warmth.

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And so even if there were
no human beings on Earth

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:10.840 align:middle line:84%
right now and all
the carbon dioxide

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.910 align:middle line:84%
that we're putting
into the air, it just

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.290 align:middle line:90%
brought it in a little closer.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:16.680 align:middle line:90%
But it would still be happening.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.020 align:middle line:84%
It would still be
coming up very soon.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.490 align:middle line:90%
And we would have this.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we got
this ice age that's

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.960 align:middle line:90%
probably going to happen.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.680 align:middle line:84%
However, are 490,000 years,
it does the exact opposite.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And instead of going cold,
it just keeps getting hot.

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's almost worse because
then, the average temperature

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:36.890 align:middle line:90%
gets up to 130 or something.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:39.310 align:middle line:90%
And it kills everything.

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:43.442 align:middle line:84%
But we have other problems,
environmental problems.

00:55:43.442 --> 00:55:45.150 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of
environmental problems

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.500 align:middle line:90%
that nobody will discuss.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.720 align:middle line:84%
They won't even talk about them
because they're so serious.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.640 align:middle line:84%
All we talk about
is global warming.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot of
things way worse than that.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants
to talk about them.

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:04.060 align:middle line:84%
One simple one is
the carbon dioxide

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:08.180 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
generating over the years.

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of environmentalists
secretly and very quietly

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:14.330 align:middle line:84%
have been very
concerned about this

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:18.970 align:middle line:84%
because the amount that would
been released, half of it,

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:21.730 align:middle line:90%
50% of it disappeared.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.740 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know where it went.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, secretly, they're
going, we got to find this.

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.170 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could find
it for a long time.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And then just a
few years ago, they

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:34.830 align:middle line:90%
discovered it's in the oceans.

00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:37.350 align:middle line:90%
The oceans absorbed it.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:38.490 align:middle line:90%
The oceans absorbed it?

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:45.330 align:middle line:84%
at first, they went, yay,
the oceans absorbed it.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:47.010 align:middle line:90%
We know where it is.

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they went,
wait a minute.

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:51.645 align:middle line:90%
And then they took readings.

00:56:51.645 --> 00:56:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that the ocean right
now has the same carbon dioxide

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.080 align:middle line:84%
readings that were in
our oceans a little

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.147 align:middle line:90%
more than 100 million years ago?

00:57:02.147 --> 00:57:04.730 align:middle line:84%
It means that every single thing
in the ocean is going to die,

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:07.000 align:middle line:84%
except for things
that were there

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.480 align:middle line:90%
probably 100 million years ago.

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.270 align:middle line:90%
We won't be able to survive.

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:10.520 align:middle line:90%
All the coral reefs are dying.

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.140 align:middle line:90%
They're all going to go.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Everything we know.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the bottom
of the food chain.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.530 align:middle line:90%
It means we're going to go.

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.850 align:middle line:90%
We have a limited time here.

00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
it means for sure.

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:22.880 align:middle line:90%
But we're the top.

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, when the bottom
goes, we're in trouble.

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:31.132 align:middle line:84%
And did you hear
anything about this?

00:57:31.132 --> 00:57:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Where do you hear about this?

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's talking about this
because there is no answer.

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.080 align:middle line:90%
It's something that's happened.

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And we can't change it.

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.306 align:middle line:84%
And so all can do is just keep
talking about global warming

00:57:45.306 --> 00:57:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.840 align:middle line:90%


00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's only one.

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:52.690 align:middle line:84%
There's over 70 environmental
issues that are right now,

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.620 align:middle line:84%
but if any one of them break
down, the whole world dies.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're all of
them are sitting there.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.080 align:middle line:84%
The ozone, nobody is talking
about the ozone anymore.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.600 align:middle line:90%
You think it's getting better?

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.714 align:middle line:84%
No, it's getting worse
and worse and worse.

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The ozone holes
are getting huger.

00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
happen all over the place.

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:12.190 align:middle line:84%
We can't live if
the ozone disappears

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.920 align:middle line:90%
because you'll go blind.

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.810 align:middle line:90%
All the animals will go blind.

00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:18.200 align:middle line:90%
We won't be able see.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.310 align:middle line:84%
The UVC light
makes you go blind.

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:23.940 align:middle line:90%
And skin cancer.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole city
in South America

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.650 align:middle line:84%
that they either have
to move or everybody

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:30.120 align:middle line:84%
has to leave from because
they're inside of an ozone

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.742 align:middle line:90%
hole that won't go away.

00:58:31.742 --> 00:58:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And you got indigenous
people there

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.780 align:middle line:90%
with really thick brown skin.

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
getting burned.

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:39.152 align:middle line:84%
They applied to
the United Nations.

00:58:39.152 --> 00:58:40.360 align:middle line:90%
They said, we didn't do this.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Could you move our city?

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't do it
because they know there's

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.960 align:middle line:90%
going to be a lot more of them.

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And you can go on and on and on.

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:48.116 align:middle line:84%
So that's one thing is the
environmental issues that

00:58:48.116 --> 00:58:49.690 align:middle line:90%
are huge.

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this
thing with the pole shift.

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:56.720 align:middle line:90%


00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And science right now is really
in denial of this whole thing.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:07.530 align:middle line:84%
What they're talking about now
is just a bunch of garbage.

00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.890 align:middle line:84%
They've actually
changed the records

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:11.975 align:middle line:84%
just so they wouldn't
have to talk about it.

00:59:11.975 --> 00:59:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've actually
gone into the universities

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.780 align:middle line:90%
and altered the records.

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:16.730 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:17.464 align:middle line:90%
But they did.

00:59:17.464 --> 00:59:18.130 align:middle line:90%
We can prove it.

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:19.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got the records
before and after.

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:20.110 align:middle line:90%
And you can look at them.

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is what it was.

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And look at what it is now,
and it's just a bunch of-- it's

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.130 align:middle line:90%
not true.

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:29.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to try to focus
in on one particular area

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.650 align:middle line:90%
here right now.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could go on
and on and on and on.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:36.380 align:middle line:90%
I could probably go for weeks.

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk
about the solar flares,

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.510 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field,
and the poles shift

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:44.745 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to try to
do it in a concise method.

00:59:44.745 --> 00:59:48.420 align:middle line:90%


00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:52.250 align:middle line:84%
When I was saying that the
records have been changed,

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:56.360 align:middle line:84%
on one issue that
we've documented,

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.636 align:middle line:84%
and that is on the Schumann
frequency of the planet.

00:59:59.636 --> 01:00:01.385 align:middle line:84%
There's a Schumann
frequency in the Earth.

01:00:01.385 --> 01:00:03.800 align:middle line:84%
There's the Schumann
frequency above the Earth.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.399 align:middle line:84%
And what the
Schumann frequency is

01:00:05.399 --> 01:00:06.940 align:middle line:84%
is lightning strikes
that are hitting

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.870 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, how many
lightning strikes per second.

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And over the whole
Earth, that's what causes

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.560 align:middle line:90%
the ringing, the frequency.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And the frequency is 7.28
Hertz, I think it is.

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>It is right?

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:27.480 align:middle line:90%
7.23.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, 7.23.

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
It has been so
consistent for so long

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that the military uses it
to calibrate their machines

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.540 align:middle line:90%
and guns and things.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And then in the '80s,
it started changing.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And it started rising, more
lightning hitting the Earth.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And it slowly
started getting up.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And Gregg Braden was
mapping with this.

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:55.210 align:middle line:84%
He's from Martin
Marietta originally.

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And he's a real scientist.

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:58.940 align:middle line:90%
And he was studying this.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And he says, wow,
this is amazing.

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.810 align:middle line:90%
And I was working with him.

01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:03.940 align:middle line:90%
We're really good friends.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:09.290 align:middle line:90%
And we were watching this.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.740 align:middle line:90%
And it kept rising.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It got up to about
9 point something.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember exactly what
it was, approximately 9.5 Hertz.

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's when our government
changed all the records

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
because we were getting
the records directly

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:28.810 align:middle line:84%
from Berkeley, California
and various places that

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:31.060 align:middle line:84%
were watching and
recording all of this.

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.550 align:middle line:90%
And we have them.

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:34.330 align:middle line:90%
We could see what they were.

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, in a single day,
suddenly all the records

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.850 align:middle line:90%
were changed.

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said, nah,
there's been no change.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:44.100 align:middle line:90%
It's 7.23 or whatever it is.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
looking at the records

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.730 align:middle line:90%
world that's not what this is.

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the Russians and the
Germans just said, this is BS.

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not true that
it's still rising.

01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, for some
reason, our government

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
didn't want us to believe
the frequency was rising.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to make a
change in the scientific data,

01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:11.686 align:middle line:84%
which is weird, which makes
you say, what else have they

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:12.185 align:middle line:90%
changed.

01:02:12.185 --> 01:02:14.900 align:middle line:90%


01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And so in Russia, Russia is
now saying that the Hertz is

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
approaching 13 Hertz right now.

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And Germany was
saying the same thing.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.190 align:middle line:90%
They agree with that.

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:31.120 align:middle line:90%
But we don't.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We're still saying, nah,
there's been no change at all.

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:37.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, this is not true.

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:39.265 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
lot of other things

01:02:39.265 --> 01:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that I've realized they've
changed in recent times.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with pole shifts.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.420 align:middle line:84%
They really don't want us to
know when the pole shifts were.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And they've changed
the data from what

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I have read and got in my house
and everything else like that.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
They're now saying the
last pole shift was--

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:56.730 align:middle line:90%
what do they say now?

01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:00.490 align:middle line:90%


01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 790,000 years
ago or something like that

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:05.660 align:middle line:90%
is what they're now saying.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.780 align:middle line:90%
And that is not true.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The last pole shift was
about 13,000 years ago.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And there was another one
about 26,000 years ago.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's massive
data on that.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Where is it now?

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:20.289 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:03:20.289 --> 01:03:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of interesting.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
This has all happened in the
last couple years, maybe less.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, what
I know from this

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
is that when there's a pole
shift, every single time

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.900 align:middle line:84%
in the past and we studied it
back for 250 million years.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But now they're back
about 450 million years.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But every time there's a pole
shift, prior to the pole shift,

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.200 align:middle line:84%
there's always a magnetic
pole shift first.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And because magnetics is the
key that makes the pole shift.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you understand the
pole shift, for a long time,

01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
1900s, scientists

01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:04.050 align:middle line:84%
couldn't understand how a
pole shift was even possible.

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got a
gyroscope, a big one,

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
the Earth rotating on an axis.

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And to change that axis to a
new axis, the amount of energy

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
would be unbelievable
to move that.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you take a motorcycle
tire going at 60 miles an hour

01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:23.420 align:middle line:90%
and try to move that.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:26.190 align:middle line:84%
If you could get out beside
the road and try to move it,

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
it would be almost impossible.

01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:31.510 align:middle line:84%
This is 80 zillion,
billion, trillion, zillion

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:35.260 align:middle line:90%
tons of moving around an axis.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.600 align:middle line:84%
It would take a moon hitting
the Earth or something

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.720 align:middle line:90%
to change an axis.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we know that the
Earth has had axis

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.090 align:middle line:90%
shifts many, many, many times.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
We tracked out at
least over 200 times

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
it's happened before, up
to 250 million years ago.

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:middle line:90%
So we know it's happened.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.320 align:middle line:90%
But how can it possibly happen?

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what was going on
the minds of many scientists

01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:59.610 align:middle line:90%
in the 20th century.

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then right toward the
end of the 20th century,

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
there were some scientists
that figured something out.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they did it in
more than two universities.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They were able to verify
that this was true.

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's now the leading
theory, since we've never

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:16.930 align:middle line:90%
experienced it before.

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:22.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a leading theory now
as to how it can happen.

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
you have the crust

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, which varies
from of about 20 to 40,

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.510 align:middle line:84%
50 kilometers deep
or so, which is

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:31.560 align:middle line:90%
like an egg shell around here.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath that,
you have the mantle.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
In between the mantle and
the crust of the Earth

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:42.450 align:middle line:90%
is a rock formation.

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:45.570 align:middle line:84%
It's homogeneous
over the whole world.

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about this rock formation

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
is that they discovered in labs
that this particular rock is

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
only rock as long as
there's a magnetic field.

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
If the magnetic field goes
away for more than two weeks--

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and some scientists
say it would take

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
three weeks, but
two or three weeks--

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.970 align:middle line:90%
after two or three weeks.

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:12.041 align:middle line:90%
It turns to a liquid.

01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.585 align:middle line:90%
It literally becomes like oil.

01:06:13.585 --> 01:06:14.910 align:middle line:90%
It turns to a liquid.

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.965 align:middle line:90%
And so now you have the crust.

01:06:16.965 --> 01:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
It could just spin
in any direction.

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So the axis of the Earth and
the major mass of the Earth

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:29.340 align:middle line:84%
doesn't stop turning
exactly as it always has.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But the crust could
rotate, which would

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:35.880 align:middle line:90%
appear to be an axis change.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And they believe
that what is going

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:42.470 align:middle line:84%
to do that is at the South
Pole, the ice forms off center.

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:43.720 align:middle line:90%
There's all kinds of theories.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I've listened to about
eight or nine experts

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
tell me eight or nine different
things about how this works.

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And they're all pretty good.

01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:52.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know which one it is.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.750 align:middle line:90%
But it always forms off center.

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
huge mass of two

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:58.520 align:middle line:90%
and three miles high of water.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
It's enough water between
this and the North Pole

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to raise the oceans, I
think, about 235 feet or so.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, if suddenly the
surface is free to spin,

01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:16.710 align:middle line:84%
there still has to
be a force to do it.

01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, that mass would
move into the spin.

01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And it would move the
axis, the appearance

01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of the axis move where you
are relative to the equator

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
would change,
except in two spots,

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
which is right where-- those
two places would not change.

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:38.300 align:middle line:90%


01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they now
think they believe

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
they understand how
it could happen,

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:45.550 align:middle line:90%
how it even could happen.

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's all triggered--
it's consistent with the data

01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
because it would require that
the magnetic poles change

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:58.530 align:middle line:90%
first and then the pole shift.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans are absolutely
convinced, and so the Hopi,

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:03.640 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to pole shift.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.010 align:middle line:90%
To them, it's not a maybe.

01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It's in their calendars.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:07.490 align:middle line:90%
It says it's going to happen.

01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:09.380 align:middle line:90%
And they believe it.

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
If there was to be a pole shift,
forget about everything else.

01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Forget about the Richter
scale of 1 to 10.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.889 align:middle line:90%
How about 1 to 30?

01:08:17.889 --> 01:08:20.529 align:middle line:90%


01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
This is when mountains
go up and down

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.180 align:middle line:90%
and all these kinds of things.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.069 align:middle line:84%
If that were to happen,
there would probably

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
be very few buildings
left on Earth

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that would be standing
because it would just

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:38.270 align:middle line:84%
be too, too huge, though this
place here has survived it.

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:41.439 align:middle line:84%
This place was
underwater three times.

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And all these mountains
were worn from water.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:47.029 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the White
Mountains that are above it,

01:08:47.029 --> 01:08:47.970 align:middle line:90%
those are jagged?

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Those were islands.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you get down and you
could see the whole thing,

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
you can see right
where the water was.

01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And you look up on top and
see you're down in the bottom.

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
You can see right
where-- it's really clear

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.600 align:middle line:90%
once you see the picture.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.759 align:middle line:84%
But that was 100
million years ago.

01:09:04.759 --> 01:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And this has been through
many, many pole shifts.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's never been inundated
with water since then.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's been very stable.

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:14.149 align:middle line:90%
So that's the reason I'm here.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.649 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Besides, I was
told to come here.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.200 align:middle line:90%
I could see why they did.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.904 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to
be a lot of places.

01:09:21.904 --> 01:09:23.529 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
matter where you are.

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
This is not about
geographical location.

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:28.247 align:middle line:84%
This is all about a
heart relationship

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.330 align:middle line:90%
between you and the Earth.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain that
later when we can.

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the magnetic poles,
let's just talk about what's

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.609 align:middle line:84%
happening with this so you can
get a really quick picture.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.940 align:middle line:90%
It's an overview of it.

01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.729 align:middle line:84%
The magnetics of
the Earth have been

01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:46.624 align:middle line:84%
stable for a very long
time, as far as we know.

01:09:46.624 --> 01:09:48.609 align:middle line:84%
You can go into the
rocks and everything

01:09:48.609 --> 01:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and see exactly
what was going on.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And about 2,000 years ago,
there was a very sharp drop.

01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And the magnetics begin to
get weaker on the Earth.

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.530 align:middle line:84%
About 500 years
ago, and the Mayans

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:06.650 align:middle line:84%
say it was 528 years ago, there
was another drop, very steep.

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And it kept leading down
to our modern day times.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And then about 45
years ago or so--

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm just guessing
approximately--

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:18.510 align:middle line:90%
it became a lot worse.

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:19.531 align:middle line:90%
And the magnetic field--

01:10:19.531 --> 01:10:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Did I talk about this already?

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>No?

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly I wasn't sure.

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:31.790 align:middle line:84%
About 45 years ago, the
magnetic fields began to wander.

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The lines don't just
go straight line,

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.950 align:middle line:90%
like you see on maps over there.

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:37.530 align:middle line:84%
They go like little
rivers heading north.

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:38.760 align:middle line:90%
They keep changing.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's a zig-zaggy
thing all over the world.

01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:47.126 align:middle line:84%
The gravity is not
the same everywhere.

01:10:47.126 --> 01:10:48.000 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Your weight changes depending
on where you are on the Earth.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of things that
we don't normally talk about.

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.140 align:middle line:90%
But that's the way it is.

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And about 45 years ago,
that's when the anomalies

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:12.490 align:middle line:84%
became so great that we
begin to watch and see

01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:14.710 align:middle line:84%
how the dolphins and the
whales, for example, begin

01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to beach themselves
and start coming up

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
because they use
those lines of force

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:23.550 align:middle line:90%
to follow their migration lines.

01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they're going along, say,

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
the West Coast of the United
States, da-da-da-da-da,

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and that line usually
follows them all down.

01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:33.229 align:middle line:84%
They usually go all the way
down into the southern oceans.

01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, the line changed.

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It goes in to land.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.516 align:middle line:84%
And they just go right up into
a beach following that thing.

01:11:38.516 --> 01:11:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they
were beating themselves.

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:42.082 align:middle line:84%
And even whales that
were 20 miles back

01:11:42.082 --> 01:11:44.040 align:middle line:84%
would come in and go
follow right back onto it.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.520 align:middle line:90%
They're following those lines.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And then birds all over
the world, their migration

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:52.220 align:middle line:84%
patterns, they were migrating,
but they weren't ending up

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.560 align:middle line:90%
where their migration was.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
They were ending up
an unknown places

01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:58.300 align:middle line:84%
because they were following
these magnetic lines that

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:02.470 align:middle line:84%
are no longer where
they used to be.

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Then in the about the
middle of the '90s,

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:13.830 align:middle line:84%
the difference in the magnetic
poles and the True North

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
of where the magnetic spin
is on is becoming so great

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
that when airplane liners
were coming in to land,

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.920 align:middle line:84%
they're compasses
were not accurate.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And so it was getting dangerous.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They had to change all
the aeronautical maps

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:32.189 align:middle line:90%
of the entire world.

01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And I've got the old
ones and the new ones.

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:34.813 align:middle line:90%
I can actually show.

01:12:34.813 --> 01:12:38.420 align:middle line:84%
You can see that they've all
been altered so that they

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.670 align:middle line:90%
could make that correction.

01:12:39.670 --> 01:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And then recently-- what,
three months ago or something?

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
You heard about
how in Florida they

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.530 align:middle line:84%
had to change the
markings down there

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
because the magnetic poles
are moving faster and faster.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.930 align:middle line:84%
They've been moving
for about 180 years.

01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But they used to move
in little tiny bits.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Now it's getting bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.525 align:middle line:84%
Last year was almost
40 miles it moved.

01:13:02.525 --> 01:13:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's getting bigger.

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:09.620 align:middle line:84%
It's now actually
legally in Siberia.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the difference
in those two,

01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:14.440 align:middle line:84%
between the spin of the
Earth and magnetic poles

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, you have to
look at the internal structure

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
because the external structure
is spinning around one axis.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.940 align:middle line:84%
But what causes the magnetic
field is the iron core.

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And the iron core, as
the magnetic poles turn,

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.280 align:middle line:90%
is turning.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So you you've got an internal
twist inside the Earth

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that is causing incredible
stress on the tectonic plates

01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and what's in here, which is
all these earthquakes that

01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:40.740 align:middle line:90%
are going.

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:48.770 align:middle line:84%
We have increased the
global catastrophes.

01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:51.950 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, it was over
500-and-something percent

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:54.940 align:middle line:90%
increase from what was normal.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting worse
and worse and worse

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
as you've noticed lately because
of this amazing stress that's

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.340 align:middle line:90%
inside there.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Then in 2003, I believe it
was, the geomagnetic scientists

01:14:15.570 --> 01:14:18.490 align:middle line:84%
of the world, of really a whole
team of these people-- they're

01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
from international-- made
a movie through "Nova."

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And they put it on
television talking

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.430 align:middle line:84%
about what was going on
in the geomagnetic field

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:32.940 align:middle line:84%
because at the South Pole,
the lines go out of the South

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.884 align:middle line:84%
Pole, curve around, and what
is traditionally thought of

01:14:35.884 --> 01:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
is it goes all the way around
and comes in the North Pole.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.840 align:middle line:90%
That is not what happens.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.690 align:middle line:84%
It goes out the North Pole,
goes into the equator,

01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
goes through, and then goes
up, and then one goes down.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not
accurate on that.

01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And today, at this
moment, they're

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
beginning to realize
this, because there's now

01:14:58.190 --> 01:15:01.035 align:middle line:90%
four magnetic poles, not two.

01:15:01.035 --> 01:15:05.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a north one, a south
one, and two at the equator.

01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't work with
the existing understanding

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
of what things are.

01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:15.340 align:middle line:84%
However, it works perfect
with Nassim Haramein's

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.980 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.730 align:middle line:84%
If you understand the
geometry he's using,

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.440 align:middle line:90%
it makes it crystal clear.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:30.070 align:middle line:90%


01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
at the South Pole

01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is that the lines are
going out and there's holes

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:37.610 align:middle line:90%
forming all over down there.

01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
They're going out and turning
and wrapping right back in.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that's making the
field weaker, even weaker.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And so in 2003, they
said that if this

01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:55.394 align:middle line:84%
continues, that we're going to
have a reversal of the poles.

01:15:55.394 --> 01:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
The North Pole is
going to become south.

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
The South Pole is
going to become north.

01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And this could
happen-- what they

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.690 align:middle line:90%
said then-- is within 25 years.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that first one,
they said in the near future.

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.100 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't give
an exact time.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
They just said some time
it's going to happen.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.510 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know when.

01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:19.730 align:middle line:90%
That was in 2003.

01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Then about two or three
years ago, something

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
like that, these same people
came back on the internet

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
because they were so worried
about what was going on.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, this is
much worse than we thought.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And the holes are growing
bigger at a faster rate

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.020 align:middle line:90%
than we thought.

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And we now predict
that this pole shift

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.400 align:middle line:84%
is going to take place
in the next 25 years,

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.990 align:middle line:90%
much earlier than we thought.

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Then a little more than a year
or so ago-- and by the way,

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
they only had 11 days
to talk about this

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and the government shut them
off, took their website down

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't let them
discuss it any further.

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they came on just not
too long ago, a year or so ago,

01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and said, this is way
worse than we thought.

01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:14.810 align:middle line:90%
This could happen any minute.

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:16.020 align:middle line:90%
These tools are getting huge.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't
going to shut off.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And they got five days before
they were shut off on that one.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't let
them to talk about it.

01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the situation is
getting worse very, very fast.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But just in the last
few months, something

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is going on that the world
was never really seen before.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows
how to deal with it.

01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know this
was going to happen either

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
because when I was told, I
knew this was going to happen.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.167 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know this phase
that we're in right now

01:17:56.167 --> 01:17:57.500 align:middle line:90%
and how it's affected humankind.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.570 align:middle line:90%


01:18:00.570 --> 01:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I knew that when it went
to zero after two weeks

01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:05.740 align:middle line:84%
it will erase your memory if
you don't have your merkaba

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:06.600 align:middle line:90%
field around you.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I knew that.

01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't
know is the symptoms

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that lead up to
that, which we're now

01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:14.440 align:middle line:90%
into this period of time.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:19.470 align:middle line:84%
For the last 15 years, there's
been an increase of people

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:21.905 align:middle line:90%
having ringing in their ears.

01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:24.030 align:middle line:84%
How many people have ringing
in their ears in here?

01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:24.724 align:middle line:90%
Look around you.

01:18:24.724 --> 01:18:25.890 align:middle line:90%
See how many people this is.

01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:27.390 align:middle line:90%
[MAN SPEAKING]

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.340 align:middle line:90%
That's caused by the magnetics.

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.990 align:middle line:90%
We know that now.

01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew what
it was going on.

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:38.220 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to say it was
this or that or what or thing.

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the magnetic field
which is causing that.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
kinds of symptoms.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a symptom or a
sensation or a feeling

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that there's a stream of
energy coming out of your ears

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:49.650 align:middle line:90%
or going into your ears.

01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one where
the inside of your eardrum

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.590 align:middle line:90%
just won't quit tickling.

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:57.160 align:middle line:90%
It just won't stop.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And another one
that's even worse

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
is where you get
dizzy all the time.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:05.260 align:middle line:90%
You lose your balance.

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's all
associated with that.

01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Memory problems is
another one that

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
is associated with
that because there's

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
a direct relationship between
the magnetics and memory.

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Also emotions, physical
emotions are directly

01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:25.600 align:middle line:90%
caused by the magnetic field.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe it what's going on
in the Arab world right now

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
is because of the incredible
magnetics that are happening

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
all over the world and that
their emotions have been so

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.765 align:middle line:84%
stressed out for so long,
they just said no more.

01:19:38.765 --> 01:19:41.820 align:middle line:90%


01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's the
trigger that's behind it.

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife was working
in Russia recently.

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:52.360 align:middle line:90%
She just got back.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
This was about maybe five
weeks ago when she was there.

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And she was set at a table
at the Ukraine Hotel speaking

01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:06.110 align:middle line:84%
with this lady from Germany who
was walking down the street.

01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:10.605 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly her heart-- this is
another effect is on the heart.

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Her heart just started going
faster and faster and faster

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.355 align:middle line:84%
and faster and
faster and faster.

01:20:14.355 --> 01:20:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't do anything.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:18.427 align:middle line:84%
And her ears started
getting really weird.

01:20:18.427 --> 01:20:19.760 align:middle line:90%
And everything started spinning.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.810 align:middle line:90%
And she collapsed on the street.

01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And they came and got into
an ambulance, brought her

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:24.646 align:middle line:90%
to the hospital.

01:20:24.646 --> 01:20:26.480 align:middle line:90%
They did a full check on her.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor comes
in and says to her,

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
there's really nothing
wrong with you.

01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:33.520 align:middle line:90%
You're just totally normal.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.811 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:20:34.811 --> 01:20:36.820 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is
you just responding

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.020 align:middle line:84%
to the incredible magnetic
field that's going on right now.

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.149 align:middle line:90%
They said that.

01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
If we knew that in
the United States,

01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:45.980 align:middle line:90%
we'd still never tell them that.

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.150 align:middle line:90%
But over there they did.

01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the major newspapers,
the government allowed this.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And they put in a huge
article of several pages

01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
telling them of all the
symptoms they are finding.

01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:01.120 align:middle line:84%
There's about 35
different symptoms,

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:06.440 align:middle line:84%
mostly with the magnetic--
memory, heart, balance,

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:11.520 align:middle line:84%
all these kinds of
things-- and telling people

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
that if you feel these
symptoms, there's really

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.660 align:middle line:90%
nothing we know what to do.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the magnetics of the
Earth that is causing that.

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're just being
frank about it in Russia.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.845 align:middle line:84%
They'll probably never
say anything here

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:24.720 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
They might in Europe, maybe,
if it gets obvious enough.

01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:32.880 align:middle line:90%


01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know
these symptoms were there.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It means that we are getting
really, really close.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.060 align:middle line:90%
We really are.

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:44.867 align:middle line:84%
We're getting
really, really close.

01:21:44.867 --> 01:21:46.950 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans are clear--
they're saying, well, yeah.

01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:49.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a pule
shift here really soon.

01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:52.150 align:middle line:90%


01:21:52.150 --> 01:21:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to know
learn how to use our merkaba

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
fields and all this knowledge
so that we don't have

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:03.240 align:middle line:84%
these kind of symptoms,
not just the memory loss,

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
but all of these
other symptoms that

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.150 align:middle line:84%
are going in there because
we have to stay completely

01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
balanced to be able to do
what we're going to do.

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:13.990 align:middle line:84%
If you end up having a heart
attack because of this,

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that's not going to help you
or the world or anything.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.936 align:middle line:90%


01:22:18.936 --> 01:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I know there are a lot of
people all over the world right

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
now working on this, trying to
understand exactly what to do.

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:27.770 align:middle line:84%
But this is the thing I
want to put across to you.

01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:32.180 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic field,
it's like a room.

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:35.660 align:middle line:84%
It completely surrounds
you and passes through you.

01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:39.012 align:middle line:84%
And it regulates many things
within your body, your emotions

01:22:39.012 --> 01:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of stuff we
were talking about.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.320 align:middle line:90%
It's tied directly to it.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.415 align:middle line:84%
And so we now have to
talk about the sunspots

01:22:47.415 --> 01:22:50.650 align:middle line:90%
and the solar flares.

01:22:50.650 --> 01:22:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Solar flares come
out of sunspots.

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on
with this because this

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%
is directly connected to it.

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
understand what's

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:06.400 align:middle line:84%
happening so you can take
whatever action you feel it you

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.120 align:middle line:90%
need to take.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.770 align:middle line:90%


01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The solar flares,
the sun just came out

01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
of one of the calmest
periods ever seen forever.

01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:21.110 align:middle line:90%
We're in Solar Cycle 24.

01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And we've never
seen this before.

01:23:24.150 --> 01:23:27.310 align:middle line:84%
It was four years
of absolute silence,

01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:30.190 align:middle line:84%
just like water
just being smooth.

01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Bizarre.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:38.867 align:middle line:84%
On Valentine's Day, it was
the next class of flare

01:23:38.867 --> 01:23:39.450 align:middle line:90%
that went off.

01:23:39.450 --> 01:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
It was the fourth
largest one in history.

01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And since then, it's
just every single day.

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:50.530 align:middle line:84%
The sun has been getting
more and more active.

01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, the solar flare,
what a solar flare

01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:57.200 align:middle line:84%
is a magnetic
pulse from the sun.

01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's magnetic in nature.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And it takes eight minutes to
get here, and then 20 minutes

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.260 align:middle line:90%
to get through the atmosphere.

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:07.342 align:middle line:84%
And then it
instantaneously-- and NASA

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:08.300 align:middle line:90%
was talking about this.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I was reading what they
were saying about this.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Instantaneously, it changes
the entire magnetic field

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
if the Earth in a second, as
fast as a lightning strike

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.670 align:middle line:90%
is what they were saying.

01:24:19.670 --> 01:24:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
you are used to the field

01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
being in a certain
strength, a certain way,

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and moving in a certain way.

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you live,
you're used to that.

01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And even if you drive a car
or anything else like that,

01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:35.050 align:middle line:90%
it's changing as you go.

01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel those changes.

01:24:36.450 --> 01:24:38.280 align:middle line:90%
You're used to all of that.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But when a solar flare
hits, you're sitting there.

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's just ding.

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It's instantly
something different.

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just like you're just
put in another spot the world,

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.700 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously, on the
other side of the planet

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:50.480 align:middle line:90%
or something.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And so another one
of the symptoms

01:24:53.980 --> 01:25:02.720 align:middle line:84%
is people feeling like they're
lost, like something happened

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know what it
is because the field changed.

01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't able
to adapt to that change.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we have to learn

01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:18.350 align:middle line:84%
is how to adapt to
these rapid changes

01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:22.930 align:middle line:84%
so when solar flare comes
in, we can adapt to it.

01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
If you can't adapt to the
speed at which it's doing it,

01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:28.700 align:middle line:84%
there is a way that you can
program your merkaba in such

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
a way that when a solar
flare hits, it stays the same

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and the solar flare
goes-- [WHISTLES] It

01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:42.440 align:middle line:84%
moves the magnetic field
to another configuration.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, instead of going
there instantaneously,

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
which causes all kinds
of symptoms and problems,

01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:51.660 align:middle line:90%
you can just take your time.

01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Track back over there.

01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:54.530 align:middle line:84%
But instead of doing
it instantaneously,

01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:56.290 align:middle line:84%
take a couple
weeks or something.

01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Just keep moving
in that direction

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.350 align:middle line:90%
because as you want to go there.

01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:00.820 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're thinking.

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:03.390 align:middle line:84%
This is what everyone
I'm working with

01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
thinks that this is
probably the best thing.

01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:09.750 align:middle line:90%


01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:11.960 align:middle line:90%
This has just emerged.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.030 align:middle line:84%
The whole world doesn't know
how yet to deal with this.

01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:18.640 align:middle line:90%
But we've got to learn how.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just throwing
out a warning out there.

01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:22.790 align:middle line:90%
We need to understand this.

01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:27.432 align:middle line:90%


01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:31.040 align:middle line:84%
What the Mayans are saying
is very interesting.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to talk
about exactly what they

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:37.080 align:middle line:84%
do because I haven't put
out enough information.

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.410 align:middle line:10%
They say how to do this
and what to do about this.

01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:46.164 align:middle line:84%
And so it's another
very simple thing.

01:26:46.164 --> 01:26:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But I can't talk about
it now because we

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:53.030 align:middle line:84%
haven't had enough stuff put out
there for it to make any sense.

01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to come
back to this later

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:59.760 align:middle line:84%
of what they say is the answer
of how to deal so you don't

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.250 align:middle line:84%
feel these symptoms
and what's going on

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
because it is
dangerous, especially

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240 align:middle line:84%
if you're driving a
car or an airplane

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.339 align:middle line:84%
or flying a plane or
something like that,

01:27:10.339 --> 01:27:12.380 align:middle line:84%
even a bicycle, for that
matter, or a motorcycle.

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if suddenly
your heart starts racing

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and you go unconscious,
that's not good.

01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:23.510 align:middle line:90%


01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:27.845 align:middle line:84%
So how many people feel
the kind of symptoms,

01:27:27.845 --> 01:27:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that I'm-- how many people are
feeling their heart started

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.120 align:middle line:90%
to race a lot?

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:37.070 align:middle line:90%


01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Really, all these things
very well may-- I mean,

01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:41.510 align:middle line:84%
you still need to see a doctor
and talk to them and everything

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:42.160 align:middle line:90%
else like that.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But it may not be anything
that they can do about this.

01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to bring it up
because it's very clear right

01:27:52.450 --> 01:27:55.200 align:middle line:90%
now to me what is going on.

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know quite
how to respond to this yet.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.409 align:middle line:84%
But after I give everything from
tomorrow and the next day, then

01:28:02.409 --> 01:28:03.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to come back to this.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'll present what the
native people are saying to do.

01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:12.068 align:middle line:84%
And you can make if your
own decision on that.

01:28:12.068 --> 01:28:15.005 align:middle line:84%
OK, this has really been
the day of the mind.

01:28:15.005 --> 01:28:18.830 align:middle line:90%


01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Thinking, thinking, thinking.

01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:22.935 align:middle line:90%


01:28:22.935 --> 01:28:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Whew, I'm so glad we're
on the end of this.

01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:27.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>I was just wondering to what
extent HAARP technology is not

01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:33.821 align:middle line:84%
having more of an
impact in terms of--

01:28:33.821 --> 01:28:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Heart?

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HAARP.

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, HAARP.

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, in terms of ringing
in the years and all of that

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and the artificial manipulation
of the magnetic field.

01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, yeah, HAARP,
mean, I haven't

01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:49.080 align:middle line:90%
been following them for awhile.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.620 align:middle line:90%
I know what they're doing.

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I understand what
they're doing to a degree

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
anyway, and the
weapon that they're

01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:01.670 align:middle line:84%
creating from this and the kinds
of things they can do with it.

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree with
this kind of research.

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.180 align:middle line:90%
I think it's over the top.

01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:09.830 align:middle line:84%
This is way more powerful
than atomic bombs

01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and potentially more dangerous.

01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>What they're doing?

01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>What they're doing.

01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:15.215 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, I thought that
the ringing in the ears

01:29:15.215 --> 01:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
was mostly caused
by what they're

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
doing, as opposed to
natural occurrences

01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:20.650 align:middle line:90%
in the magnetic field.

01:29:20.650 --> 01:29:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the Russians
in their research

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.360 align:middle line:84%
have come up with
that it's not HAARP.

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the magnetic field.

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And it has been.

01:29:31.290 --> 01:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
See, the magnetic field
actually has been pretty crazy

01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:39.370 align:middle line:84%
now for at least
a solid 30 years.

01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:46.530 align:middle line:90%


01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm leaning more toward the
natural response to what this

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
is, though it could be both.

01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what they're
doing is insane.

01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talk about it
invasive upon the environment.

01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, boiling the atmosphere
is just incredible that anybody

01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:middle line:84%
would even consider doing
something like that.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>And how that can affect
our magnetic field, as well,

01:30:08.410 --> 01:30:09.759 align:middle line:90%
our emotions, our thoughts.

01:30:09.759 --> 01:30:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>I know, I know, I know.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And all the times we've
shot ourselves in the foot

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
too by testing it and
not knowing what--

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:20.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's hard to control
and everything else like that.

01:30:20.630 --> 01:30:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But there are weapons
even more dangerous

01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:26.211 align:middle line:84%
than that that are far more
controllable that they're

01:30:26.211 --> 01:30:26.710 align:middle line:90%
using.

01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:28.430 align:middle line:90%
HAARP is a big one of them.

01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But the Russians have
some pretty amazing ones.

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And these things have never
been used in warfare yet.

01:30:35.690 --> 01:30:37.450 align:middle line:90%
We don't think, anyway.

01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:42.230 align:middle line:84%
But I hope we never
have to because there's

01:30:42.230 --> 01:30:45.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stuff
going out there that

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.080 align:middle line:90%
just goes against everything.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.340 align:middle line:90%
It's totally anti-life.

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:53.450 align:middle line:90%


01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:57.120 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond protecting oneself.

01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.100 align:middle line:84%
You would think that people
would understand that you just

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.770 align:middle line:90%
don't do certain things.

01:31:01.770 --> 01:31:03.620 align:middle line:90%
But they don't.

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:08.500 align:middle line:84%
The Russians are so good
at controlling weather,

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:09.630 align:middle line:90%
for example.

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.190 align:middle line:84%
What I was brought
over there, they

01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:13.900 align:middle line:84%
spent a lot of time
talking to me about what

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Slim and I were doing.

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:18.150 align:middle line:84%
They were following us
for years and watching

01:31:18.150 --> 01:31:19.470 align:middle line:90%
what we were doing.

01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:21.804 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually
gave us that their coils

01:31:21.804 --> 01:31:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and what they were doing
and how they were doing it.

01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were light
years ahead of us.

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.971 align:middle line:90%
And we were using their coils.

01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:32.220 align:middle line:84%
They let me bring them back
to the United States even,

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.320 align:middle line:90%
some of them.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And we were using them.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And what Bob Dratch
and Slim Spurling

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.960 align:middle line:84%
were doing, which would
take months to achieve,

[ZOOP]

01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:50.400 align:middle line:84%
You can change the entire
humidity of the entire state

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
of Arizona in one
second and drop it

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:56.150 align:middle line:90%
or raise it just amazingly.

01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And nobody could figure it out.

01:31:58.050 --> 01:31:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody
would even notice,

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:02.610 align:middle line:84%
which is what is even more weird
that you've done these things.

01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:05.213 align:middle line:90%

I don't know.

01:32:11.690 --> 01:32:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't like all that stuff.

01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:14.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's going on.

01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds of
things that are going on.

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots
and lots of them.

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing that
we're still alive, really.

01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, to me, it really is.

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.520 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that
we haven't just

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.930 align:middle line:90%
blown ourselves into pieces.

01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:31.710 align:middle line:84%
There's things that are going
on with atomic radiation that

01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:36.695 align:middle line:84%
is really, really bad, that the
world is not aware of at all.

01:32:36.695 --> 01:32:39.290 align:middle line:90%


01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of these things
are so huge that we

01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:47.020 align:middle line:90%
are right on the edge.

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:50.770 align:middle line:84%
If there were atomic war
right now, for certain,

01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Earth would not exist at all.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We would break apart
into little tiny pieces

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and we would be a photon,
be a belt, in space.

01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And scientifically,
that's been proven now.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.672 align:middle line:90%
They know this is true.

01:33:03.672 --> 01:33:05.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why a lot
of the governments

01:33:05.130 --> 01:33:09.350 align:middle line:84%
are so scared about
even a little bit

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of underground testing like
what the North Korea's doing.

01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:14.400 align:middle line:90%
We're so close.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.115 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't take much.

01:33:16.115 --> 01:33:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's other things that
are going on with radiation

01:33:18.490 --> 01:33:20.330 align:middle line:84%
about what it's doing
inside the Earth

01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:23.320 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have any idea
or understanding about.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.440 align:middle line:90%
We know it's going on.

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
what to do with it.

01:33:26.190 --> 01:33:28.700 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of positive
solutions around radiation

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that have been
developed recently

01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that are really pretty
good, especially like what's

01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:39.700 align:middle line:90%
going on over there in Japan.

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.460 align:middle line:84%
There are solutions
for what they have

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:43.670 align:middle line:90%
going on over there right now.

01:33:43.670 --> 01:33:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But the people that
hold these solutions

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.952 align:middle line:90%
aren't giving them up.

01:33:47.952 --> 01:33:48.910 align:middle line:90%
You'd think they would.

01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But they're not because
it's worth too much money.

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:56.080 align:middle line:84%
The solutions are worth
several trillion dollars.

01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.150 align:middle line:84%
They'd probably rather
let Japan go than do this.

01:34:00.150 --> 01:34:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get
them to change.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.820 align:middle line:84%
We have the solution
for radiation poisoning

01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:05.790 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely 100%, totally solved.

01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:12.710 align:middle line:84%
You could be totally
radiated beyond normal

01:34:12.710 --> 01:34:18.001 align:middle line:84%
and solve it completely
in just a few days.

01:34:18.001 --> 01:34:21.690 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly how to not
only remove all the radiation

01:34:21.690 --> 01:34:24.920 align:middle line:84%
out of the body, but solve all
the damage that has been done.

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.980 align:middle line:90%
That's now.

01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're not
allowed to even talk

01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:30.230 align:middle line:90%
about it in the United States.

01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:33.590 align:middle line:90%


01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And also all the half lives,
this has been solved too.

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.180 align:middle line:84%
The storage banks
for radiation, which

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:46.510 align:middle line:84%
is like tritium, the water that
they're dumping in the ocean.

01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:50.250 align:middle line:84%
The half life of the tritium
the 16 billion years.

01:34:50.250 --> 01:34:52.820 align:middle line:84%
That'll be here longer than
the Earth exists, probably.

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:57.370 align:middle line:90%


01:34:57.370 --> 01:35:02.086 align:middle line:84%
That's now been figured out
how to reduce that to 30 days.

01:35:02.086 --> 01:35:03.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's the longest one.

01:35:03.210 --> 01:35:05.800 align:middle line:84%
You can take all the
forms of radiation,

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.210 align:middle line:84%
take all these dumps that
are all over the world,

01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:12.140 align:middle line:84%
go in there, and reduce them
to totally harmless and useful

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:12.640 align:middle line:90%
atoms.

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.057 align:middle line:90%


01:35:17.057 --> 01:35:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Most things are only
six, seven, eight days.

01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:22.290 align:middle line:84%
You can bring them back
to totally healthy things

01:35:22.290 --> 01:35:23.770 align:middle line:90%
with no radiation whatsoever.

01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:24.950 align:middle line:90%
We know this now.

01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's been demonstrated
and proven in the world.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But they're still not
releasing that quite yet.

01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:32.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And it will happen,
hopefully soon.

01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of positive
things going on also.

01:35:38.190 --> 01:35:39.402 align:middle line:90%
It's not just all bad.

01:35:39.402 --> 01:35:40.985 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
good stuff happening.

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:47.210 align:middle line:90%


01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:50.340 align:middle line:84%
To me, I can't think about
these things too much.

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And then all the
conspiracy theories.

01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:54.714 align:middle line:84%
You can go on for months
on all the conspiracy

01:35:54.714 --> 01:35:55.880 align:middle line:90%
theories that are out there.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.560 align:middle line:90%


01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.380 align:middle line:90%
I just said no.

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to go into the light

01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to do
this because it's

01:36:08.730 --> 01:36:12.040 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that's going
to really matter in the end.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.690 align:middle line:84%
All this crazy
stuff they're doing

01:36:13.690 --> 01:36:16.070 align:middle line:84%
on technological ways and
science and governments

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:17.944 align:middle line:84%
and their politics and
all this other stuff

01:36:17.944 --> 01:36:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and the secret government
and everything else,

01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:22.360 align:middle line:90%
you can have it.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I just want to head
into that bright light

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.270 align:middle line:90%
and just keep going forward.

01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>I have a question.

01:36:29.530 --> 01:36:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:35.790 align:middle line:90%


01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>It's about 2012 and the Earth.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we
activate our merkaba

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and breathe our 18th breath and
can disappear during the shift,

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:52.155 align:middle line:90%
where do we go now after--

01:36:52.155 --> 01:36:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>When you disappear?

01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>You don't leave the Earth.

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.506 align:middle line:90%
>>But what happens to Earth?

01:36:57.506 --> 01:37:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Does it stay, or-- how
about the ice age or--

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The ice age, we always
go through ice ages.

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:05.829 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

01:37:05.829 --> 01:37:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And all these problems are not
really problems for the Earth.

01:37:08.370 --> 01:37:09.990 align:middle line:84%
The Earth can solve
all these problems.

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.448 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
certain problems

01:37:11.448 --> 01:37:14.590 align:middle line:84%
where she's going to have
a little trouble, I know.

01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:15.980 align:middle line:90%
But she'll work it out.

01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not worried about the
Earth or any of the animals

01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
or any of the life
forms or anything on it.

01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm only worried
about the humans.

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not worried about
them anymore because I

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.990 align:middle line:90%
know we're going to make it.

01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
is, first of all,

01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:36.840 align:middle line:84%
there's something going on
that the indigenous people are

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:39.370 align:middle line:90%
completely unaware of.

01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans, I sit
down with those guys.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, they've got
the cycles down pat.

01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:45.580 align:middle line:90%
They've got them perfect.

01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:46.200 align:middle line:90%
They know.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And they've got all
their information now

01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that's coming back to them
just as they prophesized.

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the process
of doing that right now.

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.431 align:middle line:84%
They've learned how to
go interdimensional,

01:37:55.431 --> 01:37:57.950 align:middle line:90%
which is one the primary keys.

01:37:57.950 --> 01:38:01.182 align:middle line:84%
They're getting exactly
on time doing what

01:38:01.182 --> 01:38:02.390 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to be doing.

01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:04.170 align:middle line:90%
And all things are going well.

01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't
know is there's a cycle

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.110 align:middle line:90%
that they are not aware of.

01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And I started to talk
about this with them.

01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And it just wasn't
the right time yet.

01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:24.540 align:middle line:84%
From a Melchizedek point
of view, we know this.

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's the reason
we came here.

01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was the only reason
we came here, really,

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:42.810 align:middle line:84%
is because of this cycle, and
because as it turned out--

01:38:42.810 --> 01:38:45.160 align:middle line:90%
And this is another long story.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's not important, really.

01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But Earth has become extremely
important in this equation.

01:38:50.230 --> 01:38:53.370 align:middle line:84%
It has become the
center of everything.

01:38:53.370 --> 01:38:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
how it happened or why.

01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.990 align:middle line:90%
But it did.

01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Normally, you would just think
of the Earth as another grain

01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:03.430 align:middle line:90%
of sand on the beach.

01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But because of certain
experiments and things

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that have happened
here, our evolution

01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:11.364 align:middle line:84%
is going faster than anything
anyone's ever seen ever,

01:39:11.364 --> 01:39:12.530 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:13.900 align:middle line:90%
We've never seen him like this.

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's just going up
and up and up and up.

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:22.510 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the actual
curve of our evolution,

01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:27.750 align:middle line:84%
right now, it's
almost straight up.

01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it's
leading to something.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And what that something is--
the everything's in cycles.

01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:41.950 align:middle line:84%
The main word is
in capital letters

01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:46.970 align:middle line:90%
and boldface and blinking.

01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:49.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the word everything.

01:39:49.210 --> 01:39:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in cycles.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's because everything
is created through a sphere.

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And everything's in cycles
with the flower of life

01:39:58.130 --> 01:39:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and the cycles that
move through it.

01:39:59.630 --> 01:40:06.080 align:middle line:90%


01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:11.330 align:middle line:84%
This particular universe, which
we think has been here forever

01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:15.164 align:middle line:84%
and will go on
forever, no, it won't.

01:40:15.164 --> 01:40:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't been here forever.

01:40:16.330 --> 01:40:19.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a very definite
moment when it was created.

01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very definite
moment when it will end.

01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And that cycle comes full
cycle during these cycles

01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that the Mayans are speaking
about, right now at this time.

01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we're coming to the
end of a universal cycle.

01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:40.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what changed
everything relative

01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to the Grays and the reptiles
and their whole view of things

01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:46.060 align:middle line:84%
because they thought something
totally different when

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:46.990 align:middle line:90%
they discovered this.

01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:48.830 align:middle line:84%
That's when they
started doing the cattle

01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:51.387 align:middle line:84%
mutilation and the
abducting of human beings

01:40:51.387 --> 01:40:52.470 align:middle line:90%
because they were trying--

01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:55.360 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they would not
be able to make it through this.

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.830 align:middle line:84%
They've been trying for
over three million years

01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:58.800 align:middle line:90%
to figure this one out.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
And they know they can't do it.

01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why they created
a race between us and them.

01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:08.380 align:middle line:84%
They used their brain,
their memory, their wisdom,

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
that they have.

01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And they put it into a body
with our emotional body

01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and blended the two
together so that a merkaba

01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:16.860 align:middle line:90%
could be created.

01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Because what's about to happen
is this entire universe,

01:41:21.230 --> 01:41:23.890 align:middle line:84%
octave of universes,
this whole octave

01:41:23.890 --> 01:41:30.910 align:middle line:84%
of universes-- there's more
than we know-- is going to end.

01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be over.

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And all life that's
here now is going

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:38.810 align:middle line:90%
to move up to another octave.

01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:39.610 align:middle line:90%
This is a blessing.

01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:40.610 align:middle line:90%
This is not a bad thing.

01:41:40.610 --> 01:41:42.310 align:middle line:90%
This is a really good thing.

01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:45.160 align:middle line:84%
It's really amazing
thing, really.

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the process of
that occurring right now.

01:41:50.250 --> 01:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And so things like pole shifts
and magnetic pole shifts

01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and the ice ages and all
these things are just like,

01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:03.430 align:middle line:84%
it's not too important
compared to when you

01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:05.390 align:middle line:90%
look at this bigger picture.

01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And the whole universe
is aware of this now.

01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:09.514 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is.

01:42:09.514 --> 01:42:10.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's why they're here.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.430 align:middle line:84%
They've focused in on
here because they've

01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
realized this is where the
trigger point is taking place.

01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And they all want
to be part of it

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:23.530 align:middle line:84%
because there aren't very
many new things under the sun.

01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:26.330 align:middle line:84%
New things don't
happen very often.

01:42:26.330 --> 01:42:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Not only the
importance of what this

01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:30.860 align:middle line:84%
is, but just simply anything
new doesn't happen very often.

01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And this is brand new.

01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:34.595 align:middle line:84%
And nobody has ever
experienced this before.

01:42:34.595 --> 01:42:38.330 align:middle line:90%


01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:41.772 align:middle line:84%
And it was humankind who
experienced it first.

01:42:41.772 --> 01:42:42.730 align:middle line:90%
We were the first ones.

01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It was the Ascended Masters
that I talked about,

01:42:44.730 --> 01:42:46.760 align:middle line:84%
where the 8,000 went
over to this other place

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and half of them stayed there
and part of them came back.

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:52.675 align:middle line:90%
That was a milestone.

01:42:52.675 --> 01:42:53.520 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.780 align:middle line:90%


01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:02.350 align:middle line:84%
When this cycle, we don't know
exactly when it's going to hit.

01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:06.060 align:middle line:84%
We know it's going to hit
sometime inside this window.

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't know which
one's going to hit first,

01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:13.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the ice
age, the pole shift,

01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:14.820 align:middle line:90%
the ozone going out.

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:17.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows what?

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Or this one.

01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:20.890 align:middle line:84%
If this one hits first, I
hope it does, because then we

01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:23.020 align:middle line:84%
won't care about any
of that other stuff

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.250 align:middle line:90%
because we won't be here.

01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll be on another level
heading in another place.

01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:30.204 align:middle line:90%
We'll be on the Earth.

01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:32.370 align:middle line:84%
But we'll be on the fourth
dimensional of the Earth.

01:43:32.370 --> 01:43:35.475 align:middle line:90%


01:43:35.475 --> 01:43:36.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's all prepared for us.

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:37.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's fine.

01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
out of balance

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:41.820 align:middle line:84%
or wrong on that level of
the Earth's consciousness.

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:43.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's perfect.

01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:47.382 align:middle line:84%
And so that's my prayer is
that this thing just happens

01:43:47.382 --> 01:43:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and we get out of here before
any of this other stuff

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:54.040 align:middle line:84%
happens because a lot of this
other stuff is just painful,

01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:55.100 align:middle line:90%
especially a pole shift.

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.610 align:middle line:90%
You have no idea.

01:43:57.610 --> 01:44:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The whole world would
look like Haiti.

01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And none of these
buildings that we make

01:44:02.610 --> 01:44:07.870 align:middle line:84%
are prepared for this
kind of movement.

01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:10.430 align:middle line:90%
And so it's up to God.

01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's up to all life everywhere.

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
it's going to happen.

01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:22.680 align:middle line:84%
But once this does happen,
I do know exactly what's

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:25.830 align:middle line:84%
going to happen from there on
because we've already done it

01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and we know what the experience.

01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:28.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:32.980 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we move over
into the fourth dimension,

01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:35.060 align:middle line:90%
we go there with these bodies.

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:39.140 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be there in
this body, but in a world

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:42.969 align:middle line:90%
you can't interpret.

01:44:42.969 --> 01:44:43.760 align:middle line:90%
It's called a baby.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.600 align:middle line:90%


01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:47.820 align:middle line:90%
You'll be safe.

01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:48.890 align:middle line:90%
You'll have parents.

01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:51.060 align:middle line:90%
You'll have a mommy and daddy.

01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But you will not
understand anything.

01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:00.910 align:middle line:84%
You'll be in colors you've
never seen before ever.

01:45:00.910 --> 01:45:05.320 align:middle line:84%
You'll be informed that
you can't comprehend.

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:09.420 align:middle line:84%
You'll be in a world that works
in ways that you don't really

01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:12.380 align:middle line:84%
understand, but you'll
get it pretty quickly.

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And you are creating
everything you see.

01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And usually, we don't
know that at first.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It's really advantageous
to know it in advance.

01:45:21.450 --> 01:45:24.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:25.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not kidding.

01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:26.555 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

01:45:26.555 --> 01:45:30.710 align:middle line:90%
It really, really, really is.

01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:31.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:45:31.210 --> 01:45:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:35.580 align:middle line:90%


01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>Hey, Drunvalo.

01:45:37.410 --> 01:45:40.120 align:middle line:84%
If there's one thing
that we could do,

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:42.564 align:middle line:84%
what would it be
to prepare for it?

01:45:42.564 --> 01:45:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Is it the merkaba?

01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Is it the psychic ability
that you showed us today?

01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I would rather
leave that until I

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:54.540 align:middle line:84%
tell-- we have the full
mapping of human consciousness.

01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
last day, once you

01:45:56.370 --> 01:46:00.650 align:middle line:84%
understand about the heart
and the nature of the heart

01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and the power of
the heart and what

01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:06.510 align:middle line:84%
happens when you connect the
heart to this and to merkaba

01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:11.570 align:middle line:84%
field and what it
means, then there

01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:14.255 align:middle line:90%
is one really simple thing.

01:46:14.255 --> 01:46:20.030 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to something so
simple that it's kind of silly.

01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Take five.

01:46:20.590 --> 01:46:22.630 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:46:22.630 --> 01:46:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And I have actually
a few more questions.

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:30.030 align:middle line:84%
For the solar flares, you just
mentioned just adapt to it

01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:31.624 align:middle line:90%
and just take your time.

01:46:31.624 --> 01:46:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And you also
mentioned that you're

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.330 align:middle line:84%
going to tell us
something else later on.

01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And for the magnetic field,
you mentioned do the merkaba.

01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And the pole shift,
move to here.

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:46.400 align:middle line:90%


01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Is New Mexico a good spot too?

01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>New Mexico's very good.

01:46:50.810 --> 01:46:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:56.377 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the Hopi,
by the way, are Mayan.

01:46:56.377 --> 01:46:57.710 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know that.

01:46:57.710 --> 01:47:00.080 align:middle line:90%
They are literally Mayan.

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And they came from Guatemala,
from the Mayan land down there.

01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And I sat in circle with
the Hopi grandfather

01:47:07.410 --> 01:47:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Eric who is the historian
for the Hopi people,

01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and Don Alejandro, who is the
head of the counsel down there,

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.620 align:middle line:90%
and listened to them talk.

01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was acknowledged that
the Hopi are actually Mayan,

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:29.080 align:middle line:84%
that a long time ago, the
Mayan sent the Hopi north.

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, the archaeologists
think that they

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.960 align:middle line:84%
came across the Bering Strait
and came down that way.

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And they just laugh.

01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:37.490 align:middle line:90%
They said it's not true.

01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:38.630 align:middle line:90%
They remember everything.

01:47:38.630 --> 01:47:42.622 align:middle line:84%
They even remember the
exact trail they came on.

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:43.330 align:middle line:90%
He mapped it out.

01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:45.538 align:middle line:84%
He showed me exactly where
they came all the way down

01:47:45.538 --> 01:47:47.060 align:middle line:90%
through it.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.660 align:middle line:90%
But they came here.

01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They were sent
here long time ago

01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.160 align:middle line:84%
to establish themselves because
this area-- it's not just

01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Sedona.

01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole Four Corners area.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.970 align:middle line:90%
There's four mountains.

01:47:56.970 --> 01:48:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And inside there
was the area that

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:05.510 align:middle line:84%
was one of the safest
places in the world

01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:07.160 align:middle line:90%
during this transition.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the primary
reasons they were sent here.

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>And the four corners
are around Sedona.

01:48:12.710 --> 01:48:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, Sedona is in the
Four Corners area, barely.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But San Francisco
Peaks is one of them,

01:48:19.930 --> 01:48:21.225 align:middle line:90%
up in one of those mountains.

01:48:21.225 --> 01:48:23.685 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
what the other ones are.

01:48:23.685 --> 01:48:24.580 align:middle line:90%
There's four of them.

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:27.150 align:middle line:90%


01:48:27.150 --> 01:48:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:28.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to say for sure.

01:48:28.730 --> 01:48:30.517 align:middle line:84%
>>I have a calling
to go to New Mexico.

01:48:30.517 --> 01:48:31.600 align:middle line:90%
New Mexico is a thumbs up?

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.975 align:middle line:84%
I have a calling to go
to Santa Fe and Taos.

01:48:33.975 --> 01:48:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that a thumbs up?

01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's definitely

01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:39.780 align:middle line:90%
inside the Four Corners area.

01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Taos is a very good place to be.

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:45.464 align:middle line:90%
Taos.

01:48:45.464 --> 01:48:48.180 align:middle line:84%
There's other reasons that
are kind of secret that I

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:53.360 align:middle line:84%
can't fully talk about
why they came here.

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But that is the basic line
is that they were sent here

01:48:56.970 --> 01:48:59.180 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that
the pole shift was going

01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:01.550 align:middle line:90%
to happen a long time ago.

01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And they knew pretty
much exactly when.

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:06.164 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of their
records were destroyed.

01:49:06.164 --> 01:49:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And now they're getting
all their records back

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.000 align:middle line:84%
so they can map
exactly when it is.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.020 align:middle line:84%
They're in the process
of doing that right now.

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're about to have, by
the way, the 13 crystal skulls

01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayans reaching back from
Atlantis all the way until now.

01:49:25.930 --> 01:49:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And they acknowledge
they came from Atlantis.

01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:29.540 align:middle line:90%
They told me face-to-face.

01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we know we
came from Atlantis.

01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.470 align:middle line:90%
So did the Hopis say that.

01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:35.820 align:middle line:84%
They're also from Atlantis
because they're from Mayan.

01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Same people, really.

01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Grand Itza
Mayan [? Council-- ?]

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I just talked to them
about a month ago or so.

01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And they told me
that they're going

01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to do the final crystal
skull ceremony is

01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:52.520 align:middle line:84%
going to take place
very soon, which

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.110 align:middle line:90%
is in October of this year.

01:49:54.110 --> 01:49:58.124 align:middle line:90%


01:49:58.124 --> 01:50:01.150 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan land used
to go up into where

01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:02.730 align:middle line:90%
the United States was.

01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:04.320 align:middle line:90%
And they lost that at one point.

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.870 align:middle line:90%
But it was up in here.

01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it sounds funny,
but the first ceremony

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:11.190 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
done in Manhattan.

01:50:11.190 --> 01:50:15.597 align:middle line:84%
But it was just an island
when they first did this.

01:50:15.597 --> 01:50:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
coming through to all

01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:18.620 align:middle line:90%
these various different places.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:21.720 align:middle line:84%
They're coming here, also, to
do the ceremony with the crystal

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.820 align:middle line:90%
skulls.

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, they end up
in Los Angeles doing the crystal

01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:28.794 align:middle line:90%
skull ceremony down there.

01:50:28.794 --> 01:50:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Then when they're
done with all of that,

01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:32.360 align:middle line:90%
they go back to the Yucatan.

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to do
the final ceremony, which

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:38.630 align:middle line:84%
is where 13 Mayan
shamans, each one holding

01:50:38.630 --> 01:50:39.620 align:middle line:90%
one of these skulls.

01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And then during the
ceremony, the living spirit--

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:46.120 align:middle line:84%
they're human spirits that
are in there-- will come out

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:48.370 align:middle line:90%
of school and into the shaman.

01:50:48.370 --> 01:50:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the shaman
will remember everything

01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:52.330 align:middle line:90%
that that person remembers.

01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of their
knowledge comes back to them.

01:50:56.230 --> 01:50:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And they combine that
with other knowledge

01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:01.944 align:middle line:84%
that they're combining through
the return of the codices,

01:51:01.944 --> 01:51:03.860 align:middle line:84%
which is another part
of their prophecy, which

01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.237 align:middle line:90%
is happening right now.

01:51:05.237 --> 01:51:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And then when they get done with
all this, which will probably

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:12.200 align:middle line:84%
be early next year, they
will remember everything.

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
speak, they'll

01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:16.530 align:middle line:84%
speak with authority
because they'll know.

01:51:16.530 --> 01:51:20.020 align:middle line:84%
But they lost almost all their
knowledge, almost everything.

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:22.360 align:middle line:84%
They were down to three
books, three codices,

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.660 align:middle line:90%
in the entire world.

01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:30.374 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm being told that
I must stop talking.

01:51:30.374 --> 01:51:34.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:34.170 --> 01:51:36.210 align:middle line:84%
We're running out of
time for this thing.

01:51:36.210 --> 01:51:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this was
the day of the mind.

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We had lots of mental things
and ideas thrown at you.

01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:46.885 align:middle line:84%
We will come back later
on this and finish this.

01:51:46.885 --> 01:51:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But tomorrow is the
day of the heart.

01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:50.188 align:middle line:90%
Thank God.

01:51:50.188 --> 01:51:53.092 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:51:53.092 --> 01:51:59.870 align:middle line:90%


01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:03.160 align:middle line:90%
So rest your little brains.

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And it will be more
fun tomorrow, I think.

01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:09.160 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.690 align:middle line:90%
You finished Day 3.

01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can proceed on to
Day 4, the day of the heart.

01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:17.536 align:middle line:90%
