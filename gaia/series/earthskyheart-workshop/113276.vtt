00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.075 align:middle line:84%
>>What I've discovered is
that the chakras that you have

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
in your palms, once you
understand what they are--

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.860 align:middle line:90%
this is important.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you need to
know is that chakras-- oh,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.750 align:middle line:90%
you have one?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>I do.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, good OK.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:90%
All right, here they are.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:90%
I just need this one.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.804 align:middle line:90%
This is one.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the older one.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.553 align:middle line:90%
They made a new one.

00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:84%
They just made a brand new
one, which is way stronger than

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:90%
these.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
They've really worked
it out, I think.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.566 align:middle line:84%
I'm really impressed
what they've done.

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what exactly
it is they've done,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:90%
but they've done something.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But they have a blue dot
on them, and that's out.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:90%
This goes in.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And the chakras, all the
chakras are facing this way.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
So like Merkaba field
is sitting this way.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:84%
You chakras are
turned 90 degrees,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:84%
facing this way and
running up the body,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:90%
and you've got 12 of these.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But the one on top of your
head, the crown chakra,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
as year big one.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And the base chakra
is also flat,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same as
your big Merkaba.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.105 align:middle line:84%
Those two sit in the same way,
and all the rest of them are

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:84%
at 90 degrees, turned this way,
running up the body like that.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.832 align:middle line:84%
And on your hand
they're like this.

00:01:34.832 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:90%
They're flat.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So depending on where you
face your hand is how it is.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So from within your
body looking out,

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
all these that are facing like
this are rotating over the top

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
counterclockwise from
inside your body.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, counterclockwise
is like this,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:90%
but you're seeing it clockwise.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
If I turn around and keep
doing the same thing,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
you can see that it's
actually counterclockwise.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:84%
You come back around,
and it's clockwise.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Earth from the top,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is spinning
counterclockwise.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it at the
bottom, it's spinning clockwise.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:90%
It's rather confusing.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the ones are
going from over the top toward

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:90%
your left side of your body.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
It's really crucial.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at a person,
you're outside of your body

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
looking at another body, all of
them look like they're moving

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:84%
clockwise because now you've
looked at the other polarity.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
If this is the person's body, it
looks like they're moving like

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:84%
this and toward the
left side of their body.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:84%
You got to get that straight
because if you do the exact

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
opposite, you're going
to make that person sick.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:90%
You're going to mess them up.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in martial arts
they do those things.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
You see them do this motion,
where they make the motion down

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:84%
on their opponent,
and up on themselves.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
They're making this motion.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.145 align:middle line:84%
And they're bringing
their energy up,

00:03:19.145 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're bringing
their energy down.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they both know that,
so it doesn't usually work.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I found that you can
actually just use your hands

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
with your intention, which is
what I did out there for you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
when you were in
the healing circle.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
When I bring the
feathers up like this,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing all of your
chakras spin properly.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's too fast for it to hold
for a long time, but it helps.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:90%
It does help.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you hold somebody
chakras for a long time,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
you can do the same
thing as these.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:90%
But it does take training.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It's really good to have these.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.411 align:middle line:84%
I had these for many years, and
they really helped me in that

00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
It's good to know that what's
really actually happening

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.485 align:middle line:84%
in the chakras, that they're
really just little tiny Merkaba

00:04:08.485 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:90%
fields is all they are.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
But from that, you can feel,
you run your hand up from here,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and you can just feel where
they're spinning incorrectly.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can just see
where all the blocks are,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and all you'd have to
do is just go there.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to touch
the person, and you can,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
with your intention,
spin that so that it goes

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:90%
into the appropriate field.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
There's times when we're
doing this healing here,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.087 align:middle line:84%
where people get
so emotional in it,

00:04:36.087 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
they have such an emotional
release that they can't even

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:90%
stop crying.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
They're just crying
uncontrollably.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And there was several
times, actually,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
where I saw the
person doing this,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
standing there,

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't stop crying.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And I use them to see
what would happen.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So I go to their heart chakra,
and I go to their upper heart

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
chakra, which is the link
to their emotional body,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:84%
from where that crying
is probably coming from.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It could be from down here.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's probably from up here.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I would go to their side
and put my hand over the upper

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
heart chakra and to the back,
link with both sides of it

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.852 align:middle line:84%
because it's a cone coming out
in both ways, link with it.

00:05:20.852 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And I could close my eyes, and
I could just see this thing.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And what was amazing
is that the chakra--

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:84%
this is the size of your
chakra, of the actual spin.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But the energy point is just
like a pinhole inside of it.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really small
what is generating the energy.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I put my hands over
them, and they're crying,

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and I could see
this thing-- huge.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They would get this big when
a person's out of control like

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The chakra's out like that,
and it isn't just spinning like

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
a top tight, it's
wobbling all over.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I with my intention,
I would take that and spin it

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
in and in and tighter
and tighter and tighter,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
until it was spending.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.578 align:middle line:84%
And the person would be cry--
ah-ah-ah-ah ooph--oooph.

00:06:08.578 --> 00:06:12.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:90%
Where'd it go?

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:90%
I was into that.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.863 align:middle line:90%
Where'd it go?

00:06:15.863 --> 00:06:18.526 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.526 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And I did that with
a lot of people.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:90%
You can do it with babies, too.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just with babies, just go
to their heart chakra and just

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
bring it into balance,
and they just quit crying.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.086 align:middle line:90%
They just feel fine after that.

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:35.189 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it the direction of
the-- the right direction

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:90%
of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the direction is that
always goes over the top toward

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:90%
the left side of the body.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're looking
at them the other way,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
it looks like the
spin is different.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's still going toward
the left side of the body.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the thing, though,
is the base and the crown are

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%
flat.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's the way you look.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
If look down at the crown,
you'll see it's spinning

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:90%
counterclockwise.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But then you look up
at the-- excuse me.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Look down at the base, and
it's spinning counterclockwise.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
You look up at this one,
which is now you're underneath

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
the opposite pole, and it's
also spinning counterclockwise,

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:84%
which means they're spinning
in opposite directions to each

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:90%
other.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the little
tricks that's really important

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
We have a whole set of octaves.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:84%
We have an octave or chromatic
scale, really, of 13 chakras.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And the length from the
base of the spine to the top

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:90%
of the head is a certain length.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We have another set below us,
where we came from another way.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you measured them,
they're much shorter.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And the distance, if
you took this as one,

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
this one is going to be
1.618, this golden mean.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:84%
If you take this one as one,
we have another set that goes

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.445 align:middle line:84%
above our head, and
they're much bigger.

00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle line:90%
They're longer.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And if this is one, it's 1.618
is the separation between them.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:84%
They're higher,
bigger, and farther.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the translation
is, as I see it,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:84%
this one's spinning in one
direction, so those, I think,

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:90%
are reversed compared to these.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.741 align:middle line:84%
And these above you are
reversed compared to these,

00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
which means that the ones above
us and the ones below us are

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.489 align:middle line:84%
in the same spin ratio, but
the ones in the middle are

00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%
different in the opposite.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Are there chakras
coming out of the back?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, they come out
of the front and back.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It's spinning tetrahedrons,
and they form cones when

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.647 align:middle line:90%
they're spinning.

00:08:39.647 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a cone
coming out the front,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and you have a cone coming out
the back of each one of them.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Except this one is going to be
in the head and out that way,

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and the base one's going to
be down that and up this way.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>If you take your right hand,
and you put your thumb out,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
no matter what chakra you
put your thumb into-- front

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
or back-- the direction your
fingers are turning will show

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:90%
you the direction of the chakra.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So here it'll turn this
way, here this way,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:90%
and here that way.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's like that,
and like that,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.917 align:middle line:84%
even in the chakra
one like that.

00:09:13.917 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Your right or left hand?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Your right hand--
right hand rule.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>If you know this, if you know
what we're just talking about

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
right now, you can become a
master healer really quick

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
because all you gotta do is be
in your heart and go through

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
their chakra system and
get everything in balance.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And that balances everything,
all the meridians,

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:84%
All the blood flow
begins to happen.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:84%
The chi begins to move through
your body right and problems

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:90%
just go away.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
There still are emotional
impacts behind that,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and some of those
emotional impacts--

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that's why I think you
have to do this many times.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:90%
You don't do it just once.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Once starts bringing the flow.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But you have to get into
those emotional impacts,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:90%
but it's very good.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So I brought this just to
explain this because when it

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
comes to healing for
me, this is a big thing.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
important thing to know,

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't cost
anything or anything.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just knowledge.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you know that knowledge
of exactly what's going

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.832 align:middle line:84%
on in all your chakra systems,
how they work, and what it is,

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and if you're sensitive,
you're a healer,

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:84%
you can probably feel
where they're at.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And you fix just the
ones that are even out,

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
just that usually makes
a massive difference

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
in a person's energy
field and how they work.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:90%
But do them all.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Do all of them.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And especially not just these,
but you have one more right

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:90%
above your head up here.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the 13th one, which
links you between these chakras

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:90%
and the ones above.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the base
of the next one,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and so that's really
important to tie it,

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:90%
and to tie it to the ones below.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
This is your past, and
this is your future.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.412 align:middle line:84%
And so I just felt that was
an important thing for you

00:11:04.412 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I think if you start
working with it,

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
if you are a healer and you're
working with people and you

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.584 align:middle line:84%
have the money, I really
recommend you get,

00:11:12.584 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
especially these brand new
ones that are coming out,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:90%
which are the thing.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't, if don't have
the money and you can't afford

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.747 align:middle line:90%
it, just learn the system.

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just learn,
figure it out what your hands,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:90%
and you can do this yourself.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:90%
We have a little bit more time.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And I stopped on those things.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I think what I want to talk now
about what we're going to do

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:90%
this afternoon.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be involved
in what is called sound

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.330 align:middle line:84%
healing, and there's a lot
of ideas about sound healing

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:90%
and how it works.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It came from this
woman named Joann Karl.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody know Joanne
Karl, they've ever been to her

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.545 align:middle line:90%
workshops?

00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:01.045 align:middle line:90%
One person.

00:12:01.045 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.490 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:90%
She's really a great lady.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could tell her story.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It would take about
half an hour to do it.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:84%
The story is amazing of how
she came into spirituality.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But through the story though,
she became directly connected

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to Archangel Michael,
and I mean directly.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
He manifested physically
to her for a while anyway.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Nobody could see him but her.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
She could touch
him just like this,

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:90%
but nobody else could see it.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I taught with her for
a while because I was really

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
learning from her because she
was doing things that I'd never

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:90%
seen before.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
All her learning was through
play and through games and real

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:84%
gentle things-- swaying people
in blankets and all kinds

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was all being led
by Archangel Michael.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things they
did was somebody was real sick

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in there, and Archangel Michael
had them stand in the middle.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And then six people stood
around them and put their hands

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
on the back and around
the side of that person,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and then another group around
that on the backs of them.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And they kept doing that,
so they're all touching.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And all they did
was sing to them.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Only, in this case, they chanted
ohm, and the energy went in.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.670 align:middle line:10%
And I watched the
transformation of this person,

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:10%
and this person was completely
healed from just this chanting.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I realized
I wanted to incorporate that

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:84%
into workshops, but I didn't
know exactly how because that

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.745 align:middle line:84%
would take forever to do
that, if you have one person,

00:13:57.745 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and the whole group working
on that one person like that.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I discussed it with
Archangel Michael, and he said,

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:90%
well, we can adapt it.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you can do it
in groups of seven or eight.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.026 align:middle line:84%
And his words were
not six and not nine.

00:14:11.026 --> 00:14:12.775 align:middle line:84%
It had to be either
seven or eight people.

00:14:12.775 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're going to do
is we're going to lay one person

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.015 align:middle line:84%
down on their back, and they'll
be a person at the head,

00:14:22.015 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:90%
a person at the feet.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest, two
or three on either side.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And one person's
holding the feet.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
The other person's
holding the head.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's holding both hands.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of hands go
on the side of the body.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And all we do is we're
just going to sing ohm--

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
the words are pretty
easy-- and alleluia.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And it took us awhile to find
out what this other sound would

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
be, but alleluia's
really good one.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
others you could use.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.606 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.606 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:90%
An energy field is created.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And you're getting closed.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:90%
You can feel this.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And a strange thing happens.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
kind of thing,

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:84%
you can just let go of
stuff, just let it go,

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's just gone.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.265 align:middle line:90%
But here's how it works.

00:15:25.265 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.775 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move this one.

00:15:33.775 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember in one of the
books I had something called

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:90%
"The Family Tree of a Male Bee?"

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody remember that?

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Wait, am I too far
off to the side?

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:90%
I think I need to move.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Can everybody see that now?

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:84%
The Family Tree of a
Male Bee is that-- well,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
a female bee can make a
male bee anytime she wants.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:90%
She does not need a male.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
She can just become pregnant and
the bee will always be a male

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:90%
bee.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
But if she chooses
to make a female bee,

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:90%
she must mate with a male bee.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:90%
That's how they have set it up.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And so here's a male bee,
and a male bee only has--

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:90%
this is male and female.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%
A male bee only has a mother.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But the female bee has a
mother-- a father and a mother.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like a tetrahedron.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the basic geometry
that they have figured out.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you keep doing this,
that means that the male only

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:84%
has a mother, but the mother
has a male and a female.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Is it clear to everybody?

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.168 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go faster now.

00:17:02.168 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even going to put
those things in there now.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:06.292 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at this, it's
one, one, two, three, five,

00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:84%
eight, 13, and it's the
Fibonacci sequence unfolding.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're binary sequence, and
they're Fibonacci sequence.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
But in there, if you notice,
I came back up the other way,

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and in music and a piano
with black and white keys,

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:90%
the white keys are the octave.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
The black keys are basically--
you can come back starting with

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
either a chord of three, then
going to five, the pentagonal--

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:90%
what's it called?

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Pentatonic scale-- the octave,
which is really 7 plus one.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
This one is also 4
plus 1, by the way.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:84%
This is 7 plus 1, and
this is 12 plus 1, or 13.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And then when you do that, and
you run these things down here,

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:02.385 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see why
the chromatic scale goes C,

00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
C sharp, D, et cetera,
all the way through there,

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and why sometimes
there isn't one.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.520 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
visually see it.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But what you're doing here
is you're having harmonics

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of music comes up this way,
and organic structure come down

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
this way, and they meet,
and they're identical.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
If you can intuitively see this,
there is a relationship with

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:84%
music, or the harmonics of
sound, and organic structure.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:90%
They're related together.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle line:90%
We used another one.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
billions of these,

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.055 align:middle line:90%
if you want to go through life.

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
There was one that the
Rosicrucians used where they

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
took a human spine, which
has 24 vertebrae in it,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:53.094 align:middle line:84%
which is three octaves
or two chromatic scales,

00:19:53.094 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
depending on how you
want to look at it.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.195 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.195 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And because it's Fibonacci,
organic structure is based

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:84%
on Fibonacci, it never reaches
perfectly the golden mean,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and so there are differences,
slight differences.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a person's height
and you take their wingspan,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
they fit inside of a cube,
which Leonardo showed.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you measure
a lot of people,

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that the
difference between the height

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.900 align:middle line:84%
and their wingspan is one
ten thousandths of an inch.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's really small,
but that small is related

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's Fibonacci in
nature and not golden mean,

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:90%
and in the same way, the spine.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:84%
What the Rosicrucians
did is they took each one

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.830 align:middle line:84%
of the vertebrae, and
they took 100 vertebrae,

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:90%
and they weighed them.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
They took the actual weight of
these things that was left over

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
after they were dried-- and
the actual weight of each one

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And they averaged them on each
one of them with 100 of them.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And they found out
this amazing thing,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and that is that the
weight of the vertebrae,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
the human vertebrae, and the
cycles-per-second moving up

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
through the chromatic
scale, cycles-per-second

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:84%
in the chromatic scale,
moves at 11 cycles-per-second

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:90%
and multiples there of.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.872 align:middle line:84%
So the first one's
11, 22, 33, 44,

00:21:19.872 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:84%
55 cycles per-second
as they move up.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And the weight ratios were
exactly in that proportion--

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom vertebrae, as
they got lighter and lighter

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and lighter, that
cycles-per-second was exactly

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
the same thing as going
the other direction.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And so again, you can see that
there is a relationship between

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
the harmonics of music
and organic structure,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and this time you tied it
to humans, not just to bees.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:84%
You could do this for
the rest of your life.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
You could just keep
picking things.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And just in the human body
there's hundreds and hundreds

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
of thousands, probably
maybe going into billions

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and trillions, I don't know,
just forever of different

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.240 align:middle line:84%
places you could find
the same relationship,

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
where the harmonics of music and
organic structure are related.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.285 align:middle line:84%
Once you know that that's
true, you can see how sound,

00:22:17.285 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
the human voice-- it doesn't
have to be just an instrument

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
or a violin or a
guitar-- but all sound.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You could even have sound
generators that can do this.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But the human voices is old,
and when the human voice is

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
connected to the heart chakra,
when it's in that place again,

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and you are either
talking or singing,

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:84%
especially when you're
seeing in harmonics,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
it's really powerful
in the human body.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It can alter the
course of illness,

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.215 align:middle line:90%
and it can do it really fast.

00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:58.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going to
demonstrate today and show you.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel this.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:84%
When you get in there, and
these people are singing to you,

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:90%
it does kind of like the disc.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:84%
You just kind of go
under, and you go out.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
state, you can change anything

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:90%
if that's your intention.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.965 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's going to heal you.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do it
yourself if you want do.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
You can keep it--
whatever it is.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So is there any
questions about this?

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.692 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you have one, right.

00:23:33.692 --> 00:23:34.233 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

00:23:34.233 --> 00:23:39.326 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.326 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>The heart chakra is
the sequence 34 and 21.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go to
the other chakras,

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
do you use the eight system
or the 12 system-- the eight-

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:90%
or the 13-system?

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Wait a minute, you go to the
heart chakra, and it's 34, 21.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>I want to go to
find the other one.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.445 align:middle line:84%
I use the eight systems to
go through the Fibonacci down

00:23:58.445 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:90%
or the 12?

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you have both system
superimposed over each other.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you have
12 chakras from the base

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.899 align:middle line:90%
to the top.

00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>So if I wanted to know that--

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>But if you just wanted to
only function on the eight--

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Hindus only pretty much focused
only on the eight or the white

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:90%
keys.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look
at the black keys.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>The real question is I want to
go down the Fibonacci and find

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:90%
what is for the sixth chakra.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:90%
So I go--

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.448 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean what the spin
ratio is in all these?

00:24:26.448 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, so I go by the 12?

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>That's not how-- yes.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking
about is yes.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:90%
But that's not how it works.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Each one of the chakras
are an individual Merkaba

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:84%
in themselves, and
they're all 34, 21.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
However, 34, 21 is
associated with the heart.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the key is that the big
one is rotating around us is

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:90%
a heart-based Merkaba field.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:84%
There will come a
time in our future,

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:84%
where we will be on a certain
level of consciousness,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
where we might be, say,
at the throat chakra,

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and that one's going to have a
different speed ratio than what

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:90%
this one is.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But if we had a Merkaba rotating
around us that was based

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:84%
on this speed ratio up here,
then all of our chakras are

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.380 align:middle line:90%
going to have that same ratio.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:90%
So 31, 21 is one.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:90%
34, 55 is another.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:90%
55, 89 is another.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:90%
89, 144 is another one.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:31.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:90%
It is a deep science.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:84%
The universe has spent more time
studying this than any other

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And so there's more out
there, more knowledge,

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.600 align:middle line:84%
more everything on Merkaba
fields than anything else

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:84%
because a Merkaba is the
key to all levels of higher

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:90%
consciousness without exception.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:84%
You can't move to a higher level
of consciousness until you know

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and can experience the next
higher level of what that next

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.920 align:middle line:90%
one is.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:84%
In our particular case, we're
not actually going to do it.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth is going to do
it for us on this first time.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:90%
After that, we're on our own.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And so right now
she's in a 34, 21,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to take us
into really the same place.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just right here.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But she's going to bring us to
the fourth-dimensional level

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, and she's
going to take us there.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Once were there though, we're
going to do it on our own from

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:90%
there on out.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And we will know when
to make these changes.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.690 align:middle line:90%
We will just know when.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a brain
about that big-- literally.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have this
giant head that you'll get,

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be about
14 to 16 feet high,

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and the women will be
about 10 to 12 feet high.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have this huge
head with these big eyes,

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and you will understand things
that you can't even begin

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.020 align:middle line:90%
to understand right now.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.594 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to know
where those 12 points are,

00:27:10.594 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to be one of
the things you were asking,

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
lay down like on a hard
rug like this on your back.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And with you, it'll be easy.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're overweight
or underweight,

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work very well.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can just measure
the distance between--

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.370 align:middle line:84%
you can use the tip of your
eyes or across your palm.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But a really easy one is
the tip your nose to the tip

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
of your chin, and that's
your measuring stick between

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:90%
your chakras.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:84%
If everybody did
this in the room,

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:84%
it would come up to
7.23 centimeters,

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.310 align:middle line:84%
which is the frequency of the
universe that we happen to be

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.241 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:27:43.241 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you lay down on the back,
and you take that measuring

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.040 align:middle line:84%
stick, and without moving your
fingers, you keep them locked,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and you put this on the perineum
and come up topographically

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:84%
over the top of your body,
you'll come out so it curves

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:90%
going up.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So you put this here, and
this one will rotate it,

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and it'll lock there.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Then you go straight down the
body; that's chakra number two.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:90%
This one's chakra number one.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:90%
That's chakra number two.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.510 align:middle line:84%
You go again, and your finger's
going to go right inside

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:90%
your navel.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I know in martial arts
they say it's below there.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:14.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:90%
That's balance.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not where the chakra is.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The chakra as exactly
inside the navel,

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and we know that for sure.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come up
again, it'll go right into that

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:90%
the mouth of the solar plexus.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You come up again; it'll go
right into the first heart

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.111 align:middle line:84%
This will be the
second heart chakra.

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're laying down,
if you're a male,

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:84%
it'll be on the Adam's
apple, which is number six.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Wait a mintue-- one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:90%
This is number 7.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.757 align:middle line:90%
This is number 7.

00:28:47.757 --> 00:28:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when you do it
again, it comes to the tip

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
of the chin, which is number
eight on a chromatic scale.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.269 align:middle line:84%
And so you just did an octave,
and so you have two things

00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.810 align:middle line:90%
going on now.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:84%
You have another one inside
the head, a small one,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.790 align:middle line:90%
that runs up through here.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:10.886 align:middle line:84%
But if you continue on with the
chromatic scale, this is eight,

00:29:10.886 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:90%
nine.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Do it again, and that's
the third eye, 10.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Then do it again.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.470 align:middle line:84%
This will be what we call
the 45, and do it again;

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:90%
it'll hit your crown chakra.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.517 align:middle line:90%
And that's the 12 places.

00:29:21.517 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But you do have another one
in here, and you can see it.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.501 align:middle line:90%
The chin comes out this way.

00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Then the mouth
goes out this way.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:28.020 align:middle line:90%
It's number two.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.394 align:middle line:84%
Then the nose
comes out this way.

00:29:29.394 --> 00:29:29.894 align:middle line:90%
It's three.

00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:31.227 align:middle line:90%
Then the eyes come out this way.

00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:31.727 align:middle line:90%
It's four.

00:29:31.727 --> 00:29:32.727 align:middle line:90%
Then it comes over here.

00:29:32.727 --> 00:29:33.250 align:middle line:90%
It's five.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.541 align:middle line:84%
Then the other ones are
inside, and you can't see them.

00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:90%


00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
You can figure out exactly
where these chakras are,

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.760 align:middle line:84%
just lying on a hard surface
and measuring them on your body.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you want to know the
Merkaba, like the 34, 21,

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:84%
like the navel, you use
the offset of 12 chakras,

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.110 align:middle line:90%
not the eight.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, within those 12--

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Like to go for the Fibonacci,
go down for the Fibonacci,

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I use the offsets of the
12th location or of seventh?

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>No, both locations are there
simultaneously at the same

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:27.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just that if you looked at
them-- here's all 12 of them,

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:31.850 align:middle line:90%
3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.660 align:middle line:90%
This is the base one.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And as you go up, these first
three are our white keys.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.102 align:middle line:90%
The next one is black key.

00:30:40.102 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you come to the heart,
and this one's black key.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:90%
This is number eight.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:90%
This is black key.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:90%


00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.340 align:middle line:90%
This is black key.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.630 align:middle line:90%
This is white key.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Oops, sorry that's white key,
and these are both black key

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:90%
also, I think.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I did
that right or not.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But both the black and
white keys are mixed up.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:84%
They're mixed up exactly as
you'd play the chromatic scale.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you go (HUMMING
A SCALE) like that,

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.540 align:middle line:84%
every time you switch
up to a black key,

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:18.450 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be one that is
not part of the eight chakra.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And so if you understand
what I'm saying,

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:90%
that's how it works.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, then I'll take
you off to the side a little bit

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:90%
and do it again.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So now the next thing with this
is I was just trying to explain

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:43.870 align:middle line:84%
why this works, why your
voice can actually heal.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And the voice could
affect a lot of things.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you see that some people
will sing a song and you cry.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Other people sing the same
song and just nothing happens

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:90%
because they're not here.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:84%
If a person's really in their
heart when they're singing,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:90%
it has an impact on you.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, the voice
not only affecting physical

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:84%
body, but it can
affect emotional body,

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and it can affect
mental body, too.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of classical
music is very mental.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The precision of it
affects mental patterns.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And since I only have a
very short amount of time,

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.076 align:middle line:84%
I have to start
talking very fast.

00:32:29.076 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:84%
There is one other thing that's
going to be going on today

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and that has to
do with entities.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very, very big
deal back in the '80s and '90s.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
About 1/2 the world had entities
inside of them, roughly 50%,

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and it changed by
geographical location.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Some countries didn't
have very much.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Some countries had a lot.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of South American
countries were very high--

00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.460 align:middle line:90%
extremely high.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Some Scandinavian countries,
it was almost nonexistent.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And it just depends
where you came from.

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But on average, about 1/2 the
world had at least one or more

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:90%
entities inside of them.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It isn't about good or bad
or any of that other stuff.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The Christian ideas, especially
the Catholic ideas of this,

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:25.420 align:middle line:84%
are, from my point of
view, simply wrong.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.102 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what they're doing.

00:33:27.102 --> 00:33:29.310 align:middle line:84%
They assume that every time
there's an entity in you,

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:90%
it's Satan, and it's bad.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:84%
That just is not
what I found ever.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, not that Satan hasn't
been inside people before

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.210 align:middle line:90%
or-- that's just one person.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Satan is a person.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is that most
of these are ETs that have been

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:84%
traveling inner-dimensionally
and have somehow got here

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and got lost from
one way or another.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.590 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to be here.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them came from Atlantis
when the misuse of the power

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.770 align:middle line:84%
that took place then
split the dimensions open,

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:14.459 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these things look
like snakes came out of the sky

00:34:14.459 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:90%
and into people.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was really a
mess toward the end.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was sick and dying.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:27.230 align:middle line:84%
It was horrible-- horrible,
worst thing you ever imagine

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:30.409 align:middle line:84%
because they all had like 100,
200 different of these entities

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:84%
inside of them, and
they couldn't function.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays you don't
see very many of those,

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.219 align:middle line:84%
and usually it's only
one, two, three, four,

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:90%
five entities in someone.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.360 align:middle line:84%
If they're into heroin and
crack and certain things,

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that's where you find 100,
150 entities or more inside

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:47.290 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:90%
They really open up to that.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can get it through
all kinds of things-- alcohol,

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.620 align:middle line:84%
not just drinking
a glass of wine.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But I mean if you're
just totally gone,

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and you do it a lot, especially
if you involve sexual energy

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.832 align:middle line:84%
There's a moment
right at orgasm when,

00:35:09.832 --> 00:35:12.290 align:middle line:84%
especially through heroin, you
just open up to the universe

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:90%
and anything can come in you.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And also through surgery in
modern times is where a lot

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.540 align:middle line:84%
of really clean,
honest, straight people,

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that don't have any relationship
to those kind of drugs,

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.570 align:middle line:84%
they just go in to get some
little thing done on them,

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and the anesthesiologist
puts them under,

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.930 align:middle line:90%
and it's just the same thing.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And they just, pfft.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I've talked now to, I think,
five or six professional

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.340 align:middle line:84%
anesthesiologists who are
also psychic and could see

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.100 align:middle line:90%
the things going in them.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And they go, what do I do?

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Every time I do this, these
people just get loaded up with

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.470 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
ways you seal them.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.730 align:middle line:90%
You can seal them temporarily.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You can seal yourself
by your Merkaba field.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
You need to do this-- block
the possibility of any kind

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:84%
of entity entering
into your body.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a major program that should
be in everyone right that you

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:11.980 align:middle line:90%
do that.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
do that, that's it.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:90%
They cannot get in you at all.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.167 align:middle line:84%
Your Merkaba seals everything
off, and they can't get in.

00:36:19.167 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:84%
They usually come in through
the back of the neck.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a little chakra back
here right where that bump

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and that soft place.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's right
where they come in.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.445 align:middle line:90%
They come in behind you.

00:36:27.445 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:90%
You don't even see them coming.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know it happens
until actually when it happens.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:37.120 align:middle line:84%
But this is a big thing for
my job of trying to teach you

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.430 align:middle line:90%
spirituality and energy levels.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:46.349 align:middle line:84%
If you have an entity in you,
it keeps you very, very often--

00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are positive
and negative entities.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.990 align:middle line:84%
There are some cases where
you've made agreements with

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:84%
people, like we did out there,
where your own angel's coming

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.910 align:middle line:84%
You have another being
inside of you, but it's you.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.422 align:middle line:84%
It's not somebody
else; it's you.

00:37:00.422 --> 00:37:01.650 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody else comes in--
a spirit comes into another

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.170 align:middle line:84%
body, they're supposed
to ask permission.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.244 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they do, and so
sometimes you'll go in to do

00:37:11.244 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that, and you'll see
that somebody's in there.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.390 align:middle line:90%
But it's a benevolent thing.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:19.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing, and
you just leave them alone.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But if it is something where
the person's been trapped here

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
on earth, and they don't
want to just live free;

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:84%
they want to live
inside somebody.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of time they'll
go in animals first,

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll
come up to people.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Those things need to be removed.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe,
like the Catholic Church,

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.350 align:middle line:84%
where you could
just throw them out.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
just throw them out,

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:84%
they just go into somebody
else immediately-- shwoop.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what Archangel Michael
does as he puts a golden

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:84%
octahedron around them in a very
specific kind of way and made

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:01.960 align:middle line:84%
in a very specific kind of
way that does two things.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It keeps the entities,
as you remove them,

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.860 align:middle line:84%
contained inside of
that energy field.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And they can't go
in anybody else.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you see us doing
this today, if it happens,

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.830 align:middle line:90%
don't be concerned.

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.410 align:middle line:90%
They cannot come in to you.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It is not possible--
literally impossible.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also the
octahedron is made in such

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:84%
a way that it connects
to all dimensional levels

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.970 align:middle line:90%
in existence.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And so once we do get them out,
Archangel Michael takes them

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:84%
through the apex directly into
the world from where they came

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:38.390 align:middle line:84%
from and releases them
back into that world.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's a win-win
situation for everyone.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.720 align:middle line:84%
The person's now all alone
by themselves in their body,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and what was this thing that was
stopping them is now back where

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.140 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to be.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:57.130 align:middle line:84%
What archangel Michael
says is that there is no--

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.910 align:middle line:84%
he's coming from
immunity point of view.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.210 align:middle line:90%
There is no good or bad people.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Every single person was created
by God for a sacred and holy

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.520 align:middle line:90%
purpose.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's just being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It would be like if you
cut your stomach open,

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:84%
you'd get blood
pouring in there.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, that blood is
supposed to be in the veins.

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.100 align:middle line:90%
It has a purpose there.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not supposed to
be in the stomach.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.817 align:middle line:84%
So if it's in the
stomach, it's a mistake.

00:39:25.817 --> 00:39:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you could get all that
blood back into the veins,

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:90%
everything would be fine.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the analogy
is very close.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.460 align:middle line:84%
If there's a spirit here, it
doesn't even matter how they

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.220 align:middle line:84%
got here or what happened,
the story behind it.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.045 align:middle line:84%
All that matters is that
person is then carefully,

00:39:45.045 --> 00:39:49.140 align:middle line:84%
with great love, taken
back to their world,

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and now they can serve the
purpose that they were created

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.960 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Because all life is one
big living organisms.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:05.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just one big, living thing,
and it's all interconnected.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But cells do get in the
wrong place or people do.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And so if I do see
someone-- but right now,

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.690 align:middle line:84%
what the earth is bound
to just about zero.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:84%
There aren't very many
entities left on earth.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:24.010 align:middle line:84%
The earth is purifying itself
and getting all these people

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.350 align:middle line:84%
to go back to where
they came from.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going on
now-- we're in the 11th year.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.610 align:middle line:84%
In 2000, groups were
formed all over the world--

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:39.090 align:middle line:84%
all over the world-- and their
sole purpose was to begin

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:41.020 align:middle line:90%
to bring entities back.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when the groups
around the world were telling

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:84%
me they were doing this, and I
didn't know what to think about

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Except as I started
doing these workshops--

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:90%
I was doing them before that.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.205 align:middle line:84%
And before that, I had to where
tennis shoes when I was on here

00:40:56.205 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:84%
because I'd be running from
person to person to person

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.469 align:middle line:90%
to person to person to person.

00:40:59.469 --> 00:41:01.860 align:middle line:84%
It was like everybody in
the room had problems.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And now, it's hard to find them.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I doubt if they'll be-- usually,
in most groups now, it's one,

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.739 align:middle line:84%
two, three, four,
and that's about it.

00:41:12.739 --> 00:41:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I was just out at
Japan not long ago,

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.130 align:middle line:90%
and there wasn't a single one.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:20.455 align:middle line:84%
I was even Columbia, where it's
very high, in a group this big,

00:41:20.455 --> 00:41:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and there was only seven people.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.210 align:middle line:90%
That is very low.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And so-- I'm sorry.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if that does happen,
I will come to the right side

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.010 align:middle line:84%
of the body because
that's how I was trained.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And whoever's sitting there,
I'll ask you to move aside,

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.490 align:middle line:84%
don't get in there
and work with persons.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty fast at this.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I go into telepathic
communication with the spirit

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:48.920 align:middle line:90%
or spirits.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't let them speak
through the person because I

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:84%
think that just scares the hell
out of the person that's inside

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't do any good,
except freak them out.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.300 align:middle line:90%
But they're very tricky.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.880 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:84%
They can become
infinitely small.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:09.360 align:middle line:84%
They can do all kinds of things,
tricks that make them hard

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.320 align:middle line:90%
to detect.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't do battle with them.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I just come at them and
say, look, I love you guys.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.090 align:middle line:90%
I understand your situation.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you want help, I'm
here now, and I do this.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And usually what happens--
sometimes people have like 10

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:90%
of them in there.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.485 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger, stronger
ones will take the little one

00:42:26.485 --> 00:42:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and push him out, and go, OK,
let's see what happens with

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.710 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:35.841 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no-- ah-h-h-h-h.

00:42:35.841 --> 00:42:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And they'll go, oh, that worked.

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.875 align:middle line:90%
OK, you guys, I'm next.

00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Once they know
that this is real,

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:90%
they usually start lining up.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.840 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what happens.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And the very first time, you
don't see usually too many.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But then once one happens,
then they all go, wow,

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:01.330 align:middle line:84%
they've been waiting
10,000 years for this.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they all start
wanting to come out.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't have to go
in there and do anything.

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:11.290 align:middle line:84%
They're just sitting
there waiting to go.

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>What would the person
experience before and after?

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>That depends on the person.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people feel
these things in them,

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and they know they
have them in them.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.260 align:middle line:90%
And they've got names for them.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.980 align:middle line:90%
They know they're in there.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
them and don't know.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
All they know is they can't
seem to manifest anything.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.171 align:middle line:84%
They can't do anything, that
these things keep messing with

00:43:32.171 --> 00:43:32.670 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.797 align:middle line:84%
And they cause disease,
too, very often.

00:43:35.797 --> 00:43:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have just been
around here so long and feel

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:84%
so hopeless that they just
don't really care what happens

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.220 align:middle line:90%
to their host.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.260 align:middle line:90%
They just don't care.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
They just think this is-- it's
like what if you were taken

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.050 align:middle line:84%
to some foreign
planet somewhere,

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:56.360 align:middle line:84%
with weird looking people, and
you were forced to live there,

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.570 align:middle line:90%
and you're the only one.

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:90%


00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.910 align:middle line:84%
You'd be thinking of nothing
but how do I get back to Earth.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:90%
That's all you want to do.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's really--

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:10.380 align:middle line:84%
But what if it was
thousands of years?

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.510 align:middle line:84%
After a while, you'd just feel
like you've been abandoned.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:90%
It's hopeless.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had discussions
with these people a lot of them.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:22.745 align:middle line:84%
And they just, they could hardly
believe that it's really going

00:44:22.745 --> 00:44:23.245 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:44:23.245 --> 00:44:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But when they see it actually
happening, they get excited.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.079 align:middle line:90%
We would too.

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly somebody
shows up, and here,

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll push this little button,
and you're back on Earth.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Wow, they want to do it.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.030 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, too, is that
when like the Catholic Church

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.170 align:middle line:84%
does battle with them,
they can change their shape

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.330 align:middle line:90%
into anything.

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And so usually when they
say, OK, it's the devil.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:54.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, all right, you want the
devil, (EVIL VOICE) here I am.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:58.900 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually see them,
their actual form and shape,

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.797 align:middle line:84%
they're usually beautiful
most of them, or simple.

00:45:02.797 --> 00:45:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some that are so
beautiful I just want to look

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:05.629 align:middle line:90%
at them.

00:45:05.629 --> 00:45:07.830 align:middle line:90%
They're just amazingly pretty.

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them, most of
them, are very innocent.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.670 align:middle line:84%
They're just we were in a
ship and something happened,

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and they ended up here.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk to
them, they're very sweet,

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:28.200 align:middle line:84%
almost always more
intelligent than humans.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
humans, where people die.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Grandfathers, very often when
they die and they go into fear

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and afraid to go on, they
go into their grandchildren.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.170 align:middle line:90%
They don't go into their kids.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They go in because
they're younger.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.382 align:middle line:90%
I think that's probably why.

00:45:48.382 --> 00:45:50.965 align:middle line:84%
And easier to get into, and they
go into the-- (CHILD'S VOICE)

00:45:50.965 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:90%
hi, Grandpa-- ga-loomf.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Grandpa, what are you
doing inside of me?

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And so you get that.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I see that a lot.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:06.027 align:middle line:90%


00:46:06.027 --> 00:46:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Somebody asked me to give
a workshop on this once.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
long it would take.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It took three days just
to give the information.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:16.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other areas
that are not discussed right

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.700 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:22.744 align:middle line:84%
People give curses and create
thoughts with such power that

00:46:22.744 --> 00:46:25.410 align:middle line:84%
they enter in, and they act like
they're alive, but they're not.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
million other things.

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.300 align:middle line:84%
There's debris
that's left by them.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Some of them start forming
families inside of you,

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and they have eggs and
all kinds of stuff.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.434 align:middle line:84%
They always want all that
stuff to come with them,

00:46:37.434 --> 00:46:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and you've got to make sure.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They won't go, and
a lot of stuff.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.425 align:middle line:84%
But at this point,
it's pretty easy.

00:46:45.425 --> 00:46:47.900 align:middle line:90%
It isn't something I like to do.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a choice.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:52.900 align:middle line:84%
If I really, truly want to serve
you and help you and get you

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.020 align:middle line:84%
doing this, I've got to
get rid of these things.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Not rid-- bring them home.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:90%


00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's what
I wanted to ask is--

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:04.926 align:middle line:90%
>>Where are you?

00:47:04.926 --> 00:47:05.425 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

00:47:05.425 --> 00:47:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, OK, yes.

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm here.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Can they hold back your
spiritual advancement?

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>They not only can, but
they almost always do.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>No kidding.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, they stop you.

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can meditate for
the rest of your life,

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:84%
but if you have an entity
in you, more than likely,

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.420 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to get very far.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.031 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
essential that I do this.

00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:31.530 align:middle line:90%
I have to.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:33.277 align:middle line:84%
I don't really want
to, like I've said.

00:47:33.277 --> 00:47:34.360 align:middle line:90%
But I don't have a choice.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.320 align:middle line:90%


00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.075 align:middle line:90%
But it's pretty easy now.

00:47:40.075 --> 00:47:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Probably, there's not going
to be more than three or four

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.090 align:middle line:84%
people in this whole
room that have it,

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:48.550 align:middle line:84%
where it used to be
1/2 the room or more.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Because the Earth
really is purifying.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.151 align:middle line:90%
Is there one more question?

00:47:54.151 --> 00:47:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes?

00:47:55.490 --> 00:48:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Why and how do they hold
back our spiritual growth?

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Why, I don't know.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.650 align:middle line:90%
I think they're just grumpy.

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think they just, like
I said, been here for so long,

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.800 align:middle line:84%
they've just given
up on any hope.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And they just won't do it.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:19.790 align:middle line:90%
They won't agree with it.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:22.570 align:middle line:90%


00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.020 align:middle line:90%
It would be very individual.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:27.110 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to ask that
person what's going on.

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I just came across a whole group
of them that had come here from

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, one of the
planets of Sirius.

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:36.980 align:middle line:84%
They were like round, black
spheres with these little

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.710 align:middle line:84%
tentacles that
were hanging down.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.100 align:middle line:90%
They were really sweet people.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really
liked who they were.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.140 align:middle line:84%
They'd only been
here a few months.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were so-- the people
didn't even know that they were

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.580 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.160 align:middle line:84%
They were being just really
quiet and trying to understand

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.260 align:middle line:90%
what do we do.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.970 align:middle line:90%
How do we go?

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And I actually wanted to talk
to them because I'd never seen

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.520 align:middle line:84%
them before, and they told
me where they came from

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.353 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:49:03.353 --> 00:49:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, well,
exactly what you need?

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:09.930 align:middle line:84%
They said, please get this
all together into one place,

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and then we will-- so we did.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.970 align:middle line:84%
We got them in there, and
Archangel Michael left them.

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.070 align:middle line:84%
They were all in this one place,
and then he brought them all

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:17.570 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:20.080 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to go together.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But they hadn't
been here very long.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Those same people, after
thousands of years,

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.210 align:middle line:84%
at some point, you just
give up, and you just think

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:32.020 align:middle line:84%
it's hopeless, and
you just give up.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Why do they come
into human beings?

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.585 align:middle line:84%
>>It's because they
want to experience life.

00:49:37.585 --> 00:49:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:47.200 align:middle line:84%
When you are on a
physical form body,

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't learned
how to be formless,

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:55.664 align:middle line:84%
it does not feel
good to be formless.

00:49:55.664 --> 00:49:57.330 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
takes a long time.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.413 align:middle line:84%
Like the [? Pleitines ?]
are almost at that level.

00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:03.200 align:middle line:84%
They're just right now, today,
in the last couple years,

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.660 align:middle line:90%
learning how to go formless.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.435 align:middle line:84%
They've been spending a long
time learning how to do this,

00:50:07.435 --> 00:50:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
starting to do it now.

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's something
that you have to learn,

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and you don't learn this until
you get in the fifth dimension.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:22.369 align:middle line:84%
That's where you enter into
the fifth dimension formlessly.

00:50:22.369 --> 00:50:24.660 align:middle line:84%
But most of these things are
fourth-dimensional beings,

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.350 align:middle line:90%
and they still have form.

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:29.250 align:middle line:90%
But they can't live without it.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So they go into us, and
they usually attach--

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.390 align:middle line:90%
they ride on our sexual energy.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.180 align:middle line:90%
They can feel through that.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll very often
connect into the sexual organs

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and the breasts and
things like this.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why you have to
know how to disconnect them.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it could really
be painful and hurt.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you disconnect
them improperly,

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.752 align:middle line:84%
than if there's
no pain involved.

00:50:56.752 --> 00:50:58.960 align:middle line:84%
If you do it right, the
person doesn't even know that

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.110 align:middle line:90%
you've done it.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But the people that are very
much in contact with the people

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that are in there,
some of them are,

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.360 align:middle line:84%
the human being part of them has
also developed a relationship

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.780 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And very often when you
remove them, they get sad,

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.060 align:middle line:84%
even though it's been
caused them problems.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.550 align:middle line:90%
They're used to it.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.162 align:middle line:90%
And they feel alone again.

00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:23.620 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like when you're
separated with your breathing

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:24.640 align:middle line:90%
tubes.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:29.110 align:middle line:84%
They're used to it, and
the human side wants it.

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:32.172 align:middle line:84%
And they develop sexual
relationships with them, too.

00:51:32.172 --> 00:51:33.630 align:middle line:84%
This is another
thing that happens.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
complex subject.

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>We're ready to go.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need to
close those doors going out,

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:01.870 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll give you the
rest instructions now.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:12.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a person going
to be lying down.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.680 align:middle line:90%
So that's a person here.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.040 align:middle line:84%
There will be a person at the
head and a person at the feet,

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.730 align:middle line:84%
holding onto the
feet and the head.

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I have to say this.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.320 align:middle line:90%
It might sound kind of strange.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:28.510 align:middle line:84%
But whoever's holding the head,
don't bounce the head around.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I see people going like
this to the person.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.540 align:middle line:90%
You can't do this.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.880 align:middle line:90%
I've had people go, why not?

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Just be still with the head,
and just let them go under

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and relax, but
you're connecting.

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:47.180 align:middle line:84%
The people that
are in that flow,

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I like them to wear their
blindfolds and so that you

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.740 align:middle line:84%
could really be sensitive
to the energy and that

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.560 align:middle line:84%
you're connecting
between each other.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Whoever's on either
side, somebody,

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:03.395 align:middle line:84%
either in this position
here, will hold the hand

00:53:03.395 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:90%
of the person.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So their hands, their feet,
and their heads are being held.

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of people,
just put your hands on the side

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.110 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
one more thing,

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.210 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of
obvious, but still,

00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I have to say it anyway
because it happens,

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.660 align:middle line:84%
especially in other places
outside the United States.

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:27.080 align:middle line:84%
But this is not a
tantra workshop.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So forget the sexual
stimulation right now.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:42.280 align:middle line:84%
People get upset
with this sometimes.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.120 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing that this time.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:44.980 align:middle line:90%
That's next week.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.870 align:middle line:84%
The way this is broken down
is that we're going to do four

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:57.220 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:01.890 align:middle line:84%
They'll be a half an hour break,
and then four more people.

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you get that break,
I really recommend you wash

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:11.932 align:middle line:84%
your hands and face, or
just throw some water on you

00:54:11.932 --> 00:54:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and clean everything off because
there's going to be a lot

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.360 align:middle line:90%
of debris going in this room.

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I do have, but I haven't
programmed it yet,

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.845 align:middle line:84%
there is a rotating
field back here,

00:54:26.845 --> 00:54:30.270 align:middle line:84%
a surrogate Merkaba field that
goes around that is protecting

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.530 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It will also filter
out all of this stuff,

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
and it won't hang around.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow we're going
to do something else.

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain what
it is tomorrow.

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't complete
this until tomorrow.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.040 align:middle line:84%
There's about 10 more minutes
tomorrow that are really

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.050 align:middle line:90%
important to finish this up.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens,
we get done here.

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:54.820 align:middle line:90%
We go to sleep.

00:54:54.820 --> 00:55:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people just wish
they had let go of something,

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.160 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't.

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes entities
are still in there,

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.190 align:middle line:90%
and they wish they had gone.

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And you get a second chance
tomorrow for about 10 minutes.

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:12.669 align:middle line:84%
And a lot happens
during that time.

00:55:12.669 --> 00:55:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's an entirely
different thing.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not a Merkaba
field I'll explain it,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:84%
if anybody wants to
know, but not now.

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go for 19
minutes of ohming and then six

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.040 align:middle line:90%
minutes of alleluia.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And the key to this is not
just ohming or making sounds.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if you just make an
ohm, it doesn't do anything.

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe it does
on some levels,

00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:43.655 align:middle line:84%
but it's not what
we're aiming for here.

00:55:43.655 --> 00:55:46.950 align:middle line:90%


00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:50.200 align:middle line:84%
The whole purpose, for what
you should understand now,

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.040 align:middle line:84%
is that we're in
our heart chakra.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.140 align:middle line:84%
We center ourselves in our heart
chakra, the lower heart chart,

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.360 align:middle line:84%
not this one up here,
but the one down lower,

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.950 align:middle line:84%
which is connected directly to
the sacred place of the heart.

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
your tube meets.

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Your breathing tube
meets in that spot,

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.210 align:middle line:90%
so you know right where it is.

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you're just breathing
and you're feeling the flow,

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:15.060 align:middle line:84%
it's putting you at
exactly in the right place.

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you are in there, and
then you ohm with intention

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:27.290 align:middle line:84%
that this person that's
on the table can release

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:32.820 align:middle line:84%
whatever's in the best divine
order at that time for them,

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.700 align:middle line:84%
anything's possible
at that moment.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.210 align:middle line:90%
It's just pretty amazing.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:40.670 align:middle line:84%
You'll see this energy builds
in this, and you'll see.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's all you do,
the people out here,

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is you just chant
ohm or alleluia,

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and you just stay in here.

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:51.410 align:middle line:84%
It isn't how loud you
chant that matters.

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:52.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not volume.

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.050 align:middle line:90%
It's quality.

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been in here,
breathing, and chanting.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.150 align:middle line:90%
You could chat low.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:59.590 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to blast it out.

00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:03.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have speakers
that will be ohming also

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.590 align:middle line:90%
and alleluia also.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't that
energy that does it.

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.810 align:middle line:90%
It's you that do it.

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And the order that goes on
to the table is up to you.

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.582 align:middle line:90%


00:57:21.582 --> 00:57:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Some people want to go first.

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Some people want to go last.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want
to do; I don't care.

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just between
this group here.

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:35.490 align:middle line:84%
The easiest place to remove
entities is through the naval.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:38.150 align:middle line:84%
There's an automatic-- just
think of an umbilical cord

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:42.260 align:middle line:84%
coming out, and there's an
automatic flow from that place.

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's really simple and
easy to remove them from here.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I get to the stomach is
where I'm aiming for, for this

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.230 align:middle line:90%
spot.

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I need to be able to get to
it and see exactly where they

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.612 align:middle line:84%
are, and see where all
the different chakras are.

00:57:55.612 --> 00:57:57.820 align:middle line:84%
If there's a blanket over
the top, I can't get there.

00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it is.

00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can, but
it's a lot harder.

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather visually be able
to see where things are,

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:07.100 align:middle line:84%
instead of sitting there having
to figure out by sensing.

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael is here now,
and he will be through this

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:12.990 align:middle line:90%
whole thing.

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:14.710 align:middle line:90%
So I think we're ready.

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:16.430 align:middle line:90%
I think we're ready to go.

00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:18.790 align:middle line:84%
There is something I
want to say right now.

00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And it will probably
mean not much.

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.649 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of this, it'll
have a whole other meaning

00:58:26.649 --> 00:58:28.940 align:middle line:84%
because this is what we're
going to be doing next hour.

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.460 align:middle line:90%
It's Saint Francis.

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Saint Francis said something
a long time ago that's very

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.910 align:middle line:84%
applicable to this
place right now.

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:42.820 align:middle line:90%
And let me bring it back.

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:47.150 align:middle line:90%


00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:50.470 align:middle line:90%
It's in giving that you receive.

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's in loving one another
that you come to know and live

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:57.550 align:middle line:90%
the meaning and purpose of life.

00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:01.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's really right on.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.870 align:middle line:90%
But we don't realize it.

00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like we think that the
person that's down there is

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:08.240 align:middle line:84%
the one that is doing it, but
you're giving to this person.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.780 align:middle line:90%
But it's in giving you receive.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And very often the person that's
sitting there giving to this

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:16.990 align:middle line:84%
person is the person
that gets the healing.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:18.720 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just there.

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.420 align:middle line:90%
It's everybody.

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It's is the relationship
that you're forming.

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:24.580 align:middle line:90%
We used to live in pods.

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:27.170 align:middle line:84%
We used to live in
groups a long time ago,

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and we breathed together,
and we were all one.

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.270 align:middle line:90%
There was no one man, one thing.

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:35.180 align:middle line:84%
They were all married
as one family,

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and everything was shared on
every level of our existence.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And we live this
way all the time.

00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:45.070 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that we've forgotten.

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you get into this,
you realize how close.

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.470 align:middle line:84%
You may not even know the
people that around you,

00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:57.110 align:middle line:84%
but it's amazing how close you
get to each other by giving.

00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:59.852 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- well,
you'll see as we go.

00:59:59.852 --> 01:00:02.185 align:middle line:84%
And when we get all done,
I'll say this thing what Saint

01:00:02.185 --> 01:00:03.095 align:middle line:90%
Francis said again.

01:00:03.095 --> 01:00:06.730 align:middle line:84%
You'll go, oh,
yeah, I understand.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, are we ready?

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:09.900 align:middle line:90%
All right.

three, the day of the mind.
