00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>So we were back
at the vesica piscis

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.090 align:middle line:84%
in the little bump inside
the back of the mouth.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.135 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it goes
up to the thalamus glands.

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
massaging that, it

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.782 align:middle line:84%
begins to fire alpha like
crazy in all four quadrants.

00:00:25.782 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:84%
You could take a
long time to learn

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.406 align:middle line:90%
how to fire that much alpha.

00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you're on top of that
spot, the alpha's going crazy.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
If you move off the
spot just a tiny bit,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:84%
the alpha goes down
to almost nothing.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Alpha is essential for higher
spirituality and higher

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You do not have
a choice in this.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to fire
alpha at a certain level

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and relatively balanced
across the four quadrants.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:90%
If you can't, you can't proceed.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And alpha, by the way, what it
is, one single word, is joy.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Children are filled with it.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.119 align:middle line:84%
A baby is just one big alpha
machine and teenagers too all

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:90%
the way up through there.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
They've got lots of
alpha being fired out.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But as you get older, the alpha
starts dropping at 25 and 30.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you're at
40 and 50, it's way down.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
By the time you're in your
70s and 80s, the alphas

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:90%
just probably gone away.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
entering into theta.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you enter
into delta, and you die.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:90%
And alpha is a key though.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
You can learn how to,
even if you're old

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
firing alpha, you can

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
learn how to redo it and
change your age very quickly

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:90%
in one week about 15 years.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:90%
It puts back your life.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And it changes everything.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.335 align:middle line:84%
But it's essential
for meditation

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and for what we're doing.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is partly
the reason why

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
some people have to do
it for so long to be

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:90%
able to figure it out.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Now they didn't know this.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Like, the Hindus and the
Tibetans that are teaching this

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
don't know anything
about the alpha.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:84%
They know what to
do, but they don't

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
know what's actually going
on on these kind of levels.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And this has really helped.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hart came to a workshop
I gave near Quebec once.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's been studying this
for 45 years or something.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And he used to work for the
government for a long time.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, one time
many years ago

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
when the government
realized what alpha was,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
they made it illegal to study
it all over the whole world

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:84%
because it makes people
superhuman if you really

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:90%
know where it leads to.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they just shut it
down all over the world.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:90%
No alpha research.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the governments
secretly keep right on going.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the
government program.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And they kept right on going
studying the alpha research.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, when it
became legal again,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
he came back out on his own
and started studying meditators

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, they've
mapped every single level

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness known to man.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:90%
They got maps of it.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And they can take you into any
level of consciousness you want

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:90%
and actually experience it.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.382 align:middle line:84%
You can become a paranoid
schizophrenic if you want.

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:90%
You can do anything you want.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
They can show you
exactly how to experience

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
what another person is
experiencing so it's not just

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
an idea, or a
theory, or something.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually
experience it.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you can take them into
any level of meditation also

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
that would normally
take many, many years.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
He can get you in a few
days just into anything.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.515 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know who
he was when he came in.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:90%
He's a very eccentric person.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:84%
He wears, like, white suits
and pink shirts with blue ties.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's got red
hair out like this.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And looks like Willy Wonka
in the Chocolate Factory.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:90%
He's a nice guy.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:90%
And he's a very serious person.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
But he's just eccentric
on his own side.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:44.749 align:middle line:84%
But he came and he wanted
to study what I was doing.

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
he was studying me

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:90%
while I'm talking it.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.214 align:middle line:84%
And so he pulls a couch
up right in the front.

00:04:50.214 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:84%
He pulls a couch from the other
room, drags it all the way

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and gets it right
there, and lays down.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.294 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.294 --> 00:04:59.525 align:middle line:90%
And he says, OK.

00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And he went through
this whole procedure.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.720 align:middle line:90%
This is what they do.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
He's got a team of people that
go around all over the world

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and study with
everybody from Sai

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Baba to all different people.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And they learn
what they're doing.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:90%
And they get into the practice.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, they go back
to their equipment.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And they've got equipment
that doesn't exist anywhere

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.170 align:middle line:84%
on Earth but with
him that he's made.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And they put gold electrodes
all over your entire head.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.735 align:middle line:84%
A big trunk of these things
come out, plugs into a wall,

00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and behind the wall's a million
and a half dollar's worth

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
of this computer stuff
and a team of experts

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
that can operate all
this stuff and read it.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And from there, within
probably less than a minute,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:90%
they know everything about you.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.404 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely everything.

00:05:55.404 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
They know precisely
what map you have

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:90%
and what your situation is.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they
can begin to lead you

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
through different levels
of higher consciousness.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
it's so expensive.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
because it cost them

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
8 and 1/2 thousand dollars
just in seven days just

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:90%
to process one person.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it's 15,000
just to be able to go

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.210 align:middle line:84%
through this training
for seven days.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But seven days of this
training is equal to 20 or 30

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:90%
years of meditation.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.382 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on, if you got
the money, it's really worth it.

00:06:41.382 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the
money, then I don't know.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:90%
But it's expensive.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the only problem.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>What's his name?

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Dr. James Hardt.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know
more about him,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.745 align:middle line:84%
he's got a website
called Biocybernaut.

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:90%
You know, like an astronaut.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Only he is a biocybernaut.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So he's going through inner
space inside the brain.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And he leads you through
all these other worlds

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:90%
that are inside of you.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
If for some reason you
are interested in this,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
let me know because he's
very interested in any one

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:90%
that I send to him.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Here's why.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.401 align:middle line:84%
When he was sitting
on there, he went

00:07:29.401 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
through all the procedures, did
everything we're doing here,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:84%
he learned how to do
it, then he went back.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And they practice
it for a while.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Then, they get into a
chamber with all this stuff

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.740 align:middle line:90%
on like that.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And they can measure
what this procedure does.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
They can actually measure
it relative to other forms

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
of meditation around the world.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And it blew his mind because
the highest he had ever recorded

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:84%
was about-- and
I don't know what

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.939 align:middle line:84%
this is reference to because
they don't tell me exactly

00:07:58.939 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But the highest that he'd
ever recorded was 700.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And they did find somebody once
that got up to almost 1,000.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But when he went back
and did this procedure

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing through,
it went up to 3,500.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:21.797 align:middle line:84%
And he came back to
me and says, OK, I

00:08:21.797 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
don't know really who
you are or what you're

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:90%
doing on a lot of the levels.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
doing, we would like

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:90%
to really investigate this.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave everything to me
free and just said, you know,

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.254 align:middle line:84%
if you'll come in
here, I really know.

00:08:34.254 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I did it because
I knew he was

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:90%
going to be checking me out.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted the access
to the equipment.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I had my own agenda
going on there.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.636 align:middle line:90%
Take me.

00:08:48.636 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it saved me because for
three years prior to that,

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to find
out where the place was

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:90%
in the roof of the mouth.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and you read books
and those things like that.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:90%
The angels were not telling me.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:90%
They were letting me do this.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And I could not find it.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know where it was.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But in three days there, I
knew exactly where it was.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I did his training for
the first two days.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was just going
through his training.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But then, once I got
it how it all works,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
they're using sound in
a totally black room.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And they use sound because
you can't use light

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
because that triggers
the pineal gland back on.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And these very specific
kinds of sound.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:90%
And there's no entrainment.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
This guy's really
against entrainment

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
where that's where
you get something

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that is a machine that puts
you into a particular state.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Now they can do that.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But when they're training,
they don't do that.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you're getting
direct feedback

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
from your brain at 350 times
a second of exactly where you

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
are, precisely how much you're
putting and in which quadrants.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're gonna
know everything.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're not telling
you what to do with it.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:84%
You're just learning
how to create alpha,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
how to make it balanced, and all
these other things like that.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And so on the third day,
I said, OK, I got it.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was seven days long.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, I got it already.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I know where we're
going with this.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I just popped out the
Merkaba, put beams of light,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.954 align:middle line:84%
turned them on, did this
thing, got it all set up

00:10:34.954 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
in what we're about
to talk about,

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and then look for that place.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And I found it within
minutes because you're

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:90%
going-- here's the sound.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.987 align:middle line:84%
It went [LOW BUZZ SOUND]
like this.

00:10:44.987 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, you hit
that one spot and it

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:90%
goes [SHRIEK SOUND] like that.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, was that, you know.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
You go back there, and you find
that one spot [SHRIEK SOUND].

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.059 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
out of my session--

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
a session is about two
hours-- I opened the door.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.964 align:middle line:84%
And a whole team is standing
there going, what did you do?

00:11:07.964 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So I told him, well, on
the tip of the tongue

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.096 align:middle line:84%
and the roof of
the mouth, there's

00:11:15.096 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
a certain spot and
all this stuff.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.334 align:middle line:84%
And he puts a rubber
glove on my hand,

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and says, stick your finger
in my mouth and show me.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.839 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they run out, put
electrodes all over their hand

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
big jump for them.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:90%
They never seen this before.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:90%
And they all get in there.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%
You have to be in your heart.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:90%
These are scientists.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:90%
You can't be in your brain.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And it took them awhile
to figure that one out.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.361 align:middle line:90%
And so he was able to do it.

00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But none of the other
people were able to do it.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:90%
None of them.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And so he didn't understand
the importance of that.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So we've had a
long conversation.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:90%
He totally gets it now.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:90%
But I learned so much from that.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.162 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful
for that happening

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.495 align:middle line:84%
because I'd probably still
be trying to figure this out.

00:12:12.495 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Anything below the
neck is biofeedback.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Anything above the
neck is neurofeedback.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
known neurofeedback

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
in the world's
entire research that

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:84%
lets you know when
you're firing alpha.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what they think.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And he knows this now.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's not known in the world
because what they know in India

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:84%
in the meditators there is
that when you're-- and they

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.937 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

00:12:47.937 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
All they know is you
have to sit there

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and meditate for days, and days,
and days, and years, and years.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And usually, around
20, 30, or 40 years

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.859 align:middle line:84%
later, this thing
happens, which is

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:84%
you're sitting there
meditating and a green light

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
appears inside your
eyes instantly.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
The whole field of vision has
this green light inside of it.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And the green light
is the neurofeedback.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It tells you when you're in
this particular vibratory rate.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:84%
When you get there in that
spot, that's when you know.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
The green light could
sometimes be green yellow.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And it can sometimes
be green blue.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
most people I'm finding

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:90%
are toward the green blue.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Much more blue
than anything else.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's still greenish.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is the secret key
to higher consciousness

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:90%
is this green light.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:84%
It means that you've got
a strong alpha production

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and that the four
quadrants are balanced.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Now they have a computer pops up
every so many minutes with four

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%
quadrants.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:90%
And they give you a readout.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It tells you exactly you're
getting feedback on that wave

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
so you can actually
see, precisely,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:84%
how much is in each
one of your quadrants.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had a low
quadrant in my left.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.420 align:middle line:90%
My three quadrants were high.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
But I had a low one
in my left rear.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.972 align:middle line:90%
And so I had to figure that out.

00:14:13.972 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And I figured out exactly
how that worked, too,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:90%
before I got out of there.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The little bump on
the back of the thing

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:84%
is divided into four sections
exactly like the brain.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.509 align:middle line:90%
And it's a mirror image of it.

00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll show this on here
a little [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
If you want to stimulate
this brain, you

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
stimulate the quadrant
that's appropriate over here.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And that one goes up.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And once I figured
that out, I was

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:84%
able to take this an increase it
over three times in one session

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
by just knowing exactly
where to rub on this thing.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:84%
But that won't do you any good
if you don't have the readout

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:90%
to know where the one is low.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that's
why that stuff is

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:84%
so-- it would be so great
if that could be, like,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:90%
$100 or something.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would just
accelerate everybody in here.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It would be like a slingshot
coming out it's so fast.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's not
much they can do.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:90%
It just costs a lot because it--

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Group discount.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>He can only take
five people at a time

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
because each one has
your own chamber.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And those chambers are
really, really expensive.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the crew
that has to monitor.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
You're monitoring everything.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
You're monitoring
heartbeat, and rates,

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and blood pressure, and all the
changes, and all this stuff.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Not just alpha, too.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:84%
You're going through gamma,
and alpha, and theta,

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and delta in all
the various stages.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.152 align:middle line:90%
All of it's being read out.

00:15:47.152 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at everything.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
these patterns.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Three dimensional patterns
that are coming off the brain.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of stuff.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And from all of that, they
can tell what's going on.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's just one of
those things, you know.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:90%
I've had discussions with them.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And we do know how
to make it cheaper.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But initially, it would cost
a couple million dollars.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to create a three
dimensional virtual reality

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:84%
program, which could then
be put down into a single

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:84%
like a Mac G5 Quad, which
is a supercomputer really.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you
do that, you would

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
be able to-- one
single person, they

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
could map everything at
once on this computer.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And the computer
itself could analyze

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:84%
what's going on if you
have the right programs.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:90%
But they just don't have this.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for three years
before that-- of course,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
I was doing then

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.930 align:middle line:90%
in those first three years.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.947 align:middle line:84%
The angel within
and says you got

00:16:52.947 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
to put your tongue on
the roof of the mouth.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And you got to find this
place and everything.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
what was going on.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I had no understanding of that.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why almost anybody
going through Korea yoga,

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
what's really going

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:90%
on inside of those levels.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
So it's up to the
instructor to get

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:84%
them do that it
still takes a long,

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
usually before they
really get good at this.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:90%
If you can develop that, fine.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Sure, all things are possible.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know how to do it.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And now I've learned
so much from this.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:84%
It's changed everything
in meditation

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
for me because now I
know what I'm doing.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, this will
help me transmit this

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to you so you could save
many, many, many years

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:90%
and go straight for the point.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's my prayer.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what I hope will happen
here before we get out of here.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:90%
So where is the point?

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
We got to figure
this part out first.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Then, there's more.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
first thing of where

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:90%
this thing is in the mouth.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at the
roof of the mouth and this

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:90%
is the teeth.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:90%
This is the roof of the mouth.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Here's the center line
running right down

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:90%
the center of your mouth.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a place here where
if you go down your throat

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
on the top of the
mouth going down,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
you have two kinds of
skin in your mouth.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.894 align:middle line:84%
You have the hard palate
and the soft palate.

00:18:27.894 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if you put your tongue
up in the roof of your mouth

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.304 align:middle line:84%
anywhere up toward
where your teeth are,

00:18:32.304 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel it's
really, kind of, stretched

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
tight.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's smooth up in there.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Now if you run down
the center of this,

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:90%
you'll keep going down.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And some people's tongues are
not long enough to do this.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep
going back, you're

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:84%
going to find that you have
this soft, bumpy skin, which

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:90%
is called the soft palate.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.732 align:middle line:90%
You feel that soft, bumpy stuff?

00:18:56.732 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you're on soft, bumpy
stuff, you've gone too far.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
You'll also notice,
if you really

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
start meditating
with all this, there

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:84%
is a vesica piscis on
the roof of your mouth.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It's shaped like this.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And right here, you're going to
have another one right there.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is the place
you're looking for.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It varies in different
people anywhere

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
from a 16th of an inch to
maybe a quarter of an inch

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
on from the bump of the soft
palate onto the hard palate.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this little
spot right there

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is very narrow where you've
come off of the soft palate

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:90%
onto the hard palate.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's the tip
of that right here.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, the pump is
right behind there.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And so just from that
little bit of instructions

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:90%
would save you years.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.517 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are up here.

00:19:58.517 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:84%
They're going on to actually the
roof of the mouth up in here.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.183 align:middle line:90%
And there's nothing there.

00:20:02.183 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
You could do that forever,
and nothing's going to happen.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.820 align:middle line:84%
However, there's a little
detail I want to throw out

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:84%
is that when you
have teeth removed,

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
it changes the
configuration slightly.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And where a tooth is removed,
if you rub that area,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:90%
it will also fire alpha.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why, but it does.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's not actually what
you're trying to get to.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's not strong enough
to do what this does.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:84%
You have to think of
this of sex because it's

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:90%
very much like sex.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the alpha is only
fired, the stimulation is only

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
happening, while the
timing is rubbing it.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
The moment you remove it, the
alpha stops instantaneously.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.581 align:middle line:84%
It requires stimulation,
exactly like sex.

00:20:53.581 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:84%
There's no different
because it really is.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.775 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing is I'm going
to blow this up right here.

00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is that there.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's divided
into four quadrants.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.075 align:middle line:90%
The brain.

00:21:11.075 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is the nose.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at
a head from the top.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And the brain, you saw
this at another one.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.566 align:middle line:90%
It has a reflection.

00:21:26.566 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Are you showing [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>No, this is the brain
from the top of the head.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is the nose.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is this
little bump right here.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship
between this and the brain.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to get this
out because it was, kind of,

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:90%
a pretty important discovery.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
For me, this is the north
pole looking down this way.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Here's the nose.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.170 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.395 align:middle line:90%
And this was my low quadrant.

00:22:05.395 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And I found out
that if I massage

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.700 align:middle line:84%
this quadrant
diagonally across them

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.260 align:middle line:84%
here, this would cause
alpha to be fired.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
If I just massaged
only that quadrant,

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
only that quadrant would be
where the alpha comes out of.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.324 align:middle line:90%
And so I can switch it around.

00:22:24.324 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So normally, if you're
trying to do the whole thing,

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
you just keep moving it
around all four quadrants back

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:90%
and forth or any way you want.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:90%
But you have to keep moving it.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
physical touch of the tip

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.907 align:middle line:84%
of the tongue on this
point or nothing happens.

00:22:40.907 --> 00:22:42.448 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE] so
small [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:42.448 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Well it's about that long,
usually, for most people.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:90%
And you can do it.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:51.398 align:middle line:90%
So you can do it.

00:22:51.398 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:84%
You can, but this information
doesn't do much good if you

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.630 align:middle line:90%
don't have neurofeedback.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.421 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have any
feedback coming back,

00:23:02.421 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
you can't really
access that very well.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.462 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to
throw it out there

00:23:06.462 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
because there might be
researchers in here that

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:90%
want to go further with this.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>I went to an
alternative doctor once.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have a little bump
right in that location.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said about 15% of
the population of people

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
have a little raised
bump in that area.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the area.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not entirely sure.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
But in a group this size,
there should be a few people

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:90%
that have a bump there.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:90%

>>Yes, that's right.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this is
why if you've ever

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
noticed what babies do when they
get all cranky and everything

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.064 align:middle line:84%
and they're crying
and everything else,

00:23:58.064 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:90%
what do they do?

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
They stick their thumb in their
mouth exactly on that spot.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And they got this smooth
part of their thumb on there.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And they start rubbing
it and sucking it.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, very,
very quickly, usually, they

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:90%
calm down.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.830 align:middle line:90%
And they feel good.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's because they're
firing alpha now, which is joy.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:19.984 align:middle line:90%
And they feel great.

00:24:19.984 --> 00:24:22.108 align:middle line:84%
And as long as they suck
their thumb, they're fine.

00:24:22.108 --> 00:24:24.176 align:middle line:84%
But the moment they
pull it out, wah.

00:24:24.176 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:90%

of the soft palate?

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.222 align:middle line:84%

that, like, distinctly.

00:24:48.222 --> 00:24:49.096 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:51.474 align:middle line:84%
It's not on the
soft palate at all.

>>So it's more--

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>It is on the hard palate.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>On that edge, OK, cool.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>It's right on the edge.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was trying to say
is that this is soft palate.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
After this little wavy
thing, that's soft palate.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:90%
This is hard palate.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And you come back from the soft
palate onto the hard palate

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:90%
just a little tiny bit.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
edge of the tip of it is.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is,
like I said, if you suck it,

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
you can suck your thumb,
or you can pull it down

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.699 align:middle line:84%
with your tongue
by pulling it down.

00:25:23.699 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:90%
Then, you can start rubbing it.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you start
rubbing it, after a few minutes,

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:90%
it's going to swell up.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:90%
It will get big.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%

30 minutes, this thing

way off to either side,

any difference anymore.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:90%
the little hole, went up.

I could feel then the
impression of the palate

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:90%
and the soft thing real easy.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:90%
And then, it was right there.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.072 align:middle line:84%
It's right there from
that dimple forward

00:27:12.072 --> 00:27:13.280 align:middle line:90%
onto the palate a little bit.

minutes that the bump gets

But the longer I kept

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think this
is pretty clear.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to this now.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:15.600 align:middle line:90%


00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.885 align:middle line:84%
So you're in the tiny
place of the heart.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%
This is the key.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:84%
None of this will
work if you're not.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And there is a relationship
between here and this tongue.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It goes up on the mouth.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.610 align:middle line:84%
That then goes up
to this area up here

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.020 align:middle line:90%
where there is the thymus gland.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I'll just do it with
dotted lines, kind of.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:90%


00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:90%
They're toward the back.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:90%
They're big, bigger.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland is
nestled right in there.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.320 align:middle line:90%
And then, the chakra is forward.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So this, the heart
space, is connected

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:84%
through the roof of the tongue
onto the roof of the mouth.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:84%
From there over to here
begins to fire alpha.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
While you're doing that, the
next thing that you have to do,

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:84%
you're waiting for this
green light to appear.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't appeared.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:90%
So you have to keep doing this.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Even when it does
appear, you can't stop.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:90%
If you ever stop, it's over.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
It's over in a half
second, everything.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:30.570 align:middle line:90%
You got to start over.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:35.101 align:middle line:84%
But once you've got it
going, you can stop.

00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you
have to wet your mouth

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:37.808 align:middle line:90%
or you get drier than--

00:29:37.808 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:84%
You can stop, wet your
mouth, and keep going.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And even though it'll
stop during that time,

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:90%
it'll start up instantly.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Again there's
hardly any time lag.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So you can stop long enough
to stop dryness, et cetera.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:30:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing that happens
is the pineal gland itself,

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
the actual gland, you have
to put your attention on that

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:90%
while you're down here.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:84%
You're assuming that these
beams are all up and connected.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's already taken place.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And you're down here.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.799 align:middle line:90%
And you're rubbing this thing.

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:19.462 align:middle line:84%
And you're exciting
the alpha waves.

00:30:19.462 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
While you're waiting
for the green light,

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:22.710 align:middle line:90%
you have to do another thing.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And you go to the
pineal gland itself.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, the
pineal gland is an eye.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, it's hollow.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:84%
It has color receptors
on it, has a lens on it,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:90%
but the lens is looking up.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And with intention,
you have to get the eye

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to turn and look out
through this place.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Now I'd like you to do this.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Measure this.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Go up, and find out, and rock it
over until you find that spot.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.680 align:middle line:84%
That spot is where you're
going to look out of.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look out of any other
place, this won't work.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So you have to realize that
when you're closing your eyes,

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
you tend to look out through
this level of your eyes.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But now you're going to
be asked to not look out

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:15.580 align:middle line:84%
through this place but look
out through this level up here.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:84%
That's another stumbling
block that people sometime

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.810 align:middle line:90%
takes years.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:90%
They do the meditation.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And they got their eyes closed.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But they're looking
out through their eyes,

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:90%
not through this place up here.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.580 align:middle line:90%
It's essential.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why they also
in kundalini and Kriya yoga,

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:84%
they have you slightly
cross your eyes and look up.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not just
looking up anywhere.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:40.210 align:middle line:90%
You're looking up at that spot.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:84%
You want to cross your eyes
and look up to that spot

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:84%
so that when you are doing
what we're about to say

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:84%
you look out through this place
up here because it will not

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.302 align:middle line:84%
happen if you look out
through down here, OK.

00:31:56.302 --> 00:31:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE]
green light go off.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>Before the green light.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to get this
part going before you

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
see the green light so when
the green light happens,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.980 align:middle line:90%
you're ready for it, OK.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:90%
So you rotate the eye.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And to show you in The
Great White Brotherhood,

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.030 align:middle line:84%
if you read their
instructions, it

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.975 align:middle line:84%
tells you that in the pineal
gland there's a flame of light.

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they didn't know
what they were talking about.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And that you have to bend the
flame so that the flame points

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:90%
toward this direction.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.757 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it really is is you
have an actual eyeball there.

00:32:36.757 --> 00:32:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And with your intention, just
like with these eyes, when

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:42.565 align:middle line:84%
you look over here, you want
to use the same intention

00:32:42.565 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:90%
that you used to do that.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.500 align:middle line:90%
But you put your attention here.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And with your intention, you get
that eye to rotate and look out

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:90%
of this place.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the next thing.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Then, there is
another chakra point

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.830 align:middle line:90%
right here right in front.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:07.215 align:middle line:84%
And this one is connected
to the pituitary glands.

00:33:07.215 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And that eye has to look
at the pituitary gland.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that,
you're now in position

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.889 align:middle line:90%
waiting for the green light.

00:33:23.889 --> 00:33:25.430 align:middle line:84%
There's no sense in
going any further

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:84%
because, without the green
light, you can't do anything.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And so once the green light
appears-- and it usually just,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
kind of, fills your
field of vision.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people see it with
blotches and stuff.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:90%
But we're all different.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how it appears,
as soon as you see it,

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:84%
you continue looking from
here to this point in front.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Higher than here, up here.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.810 align:middle line:90%


00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And when this happens and
when you see this happen,

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:90%
you will know this is happening.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It won't be, did that
happen, or maybe or what.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.600 align:middle line:84%
It's absolute for sure
because the green light

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.334 align:middle line:84%
will, 90% of the
time, it's going

00:34:07.334 --> 00:34:08.500 align:middle line:90%
to do what I'm about to say.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
few other exceptions.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:84%
The green light will come in,
form right before your eyes,

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.570 align:middle line:90%
and form a spiral.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.839 align:middle line:84%
And the spiral
will go from here.

00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:90%
It'll go like this.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:23.870 align:middle line:84%
It'll go [SOUND EFFECT] and
it'll lock on this thing here.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it when it locks.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.290 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle line:90%
It'll just spiral right in.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter which
direction it goes.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to go
[SOUND EFFECT] and lock.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And when it locks, there's
one more step you do just

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.120 align:middle line:90%
to give you the big picture.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:47.610 align:middle line:84%
You have another chakra in space
in front of you at about there.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:51.931 align:middle line:84%
That chakra point, you
actually have two more.

00:34:51.931 --> 00:34:53.889 align:middle line:84%
You have another one here
and you have another.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:84%
There's five channels
that go up the body.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And each one has five
chakras associated with it

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.165 align:middle line:90%
in each straight line.

00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's another
one back here.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
out behind your head.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Then, we don't care
about those right now.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:90%
This one's out in front.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know where
it is, [INAUDIBLE] thing.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:84%
That's where it is in
space, out in front of you.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And so once you see that spiral
come in and lock these two

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:84%
things together,
with your intention,

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:29.170 align:middle line:84%
you look through the pineal
chakra here to this one.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.772 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy.

00:35:30.772 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:90%
That part's easy.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.640 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a moment of
intention, go through, connect,

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:90%
and it does.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, when
these three are connected

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.650 align:middle line:84%
all together in this way
while you're in your heart

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're still rubbing your
tongue, this sphere appears.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And this whole thing
begins to glow.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:90%
And you have a halo.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
photograph it or see it.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And James Hardt has photographed
this scientifically many times.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And you are now in the
exact place where Jesus was,

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:84%
only he was there all
the time, day and night.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you
are in the position

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%
to be able to create anything.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me, not true.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:84%
You are in the position
to create certain things.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:28.225 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to explain what
I mean by that in a moment.

00:36:28.225 --> 00:36:31.340 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you're sitting
here, and this is going,

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and this is linked
in here like this,

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.390 align:middle line:90%
your third eye now is wide open.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And whatever image
that you see here

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that you decide what you
want, or if you're just

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:84%
being a channel and you're
letting God move through you,

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:84%
whatever image comes
here, it comes into here.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Once this is all
linked, it actually

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.700 align:middle line:84%
first appears in this
sphere around here

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.310 align:middle line:84%
around your head
right around here.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But the Leonardo sphere, the big
one that goes around out here,

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, that one passes
through this same point

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:90%
up here in the 13th chakra.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And this sphere,
and that sphere,

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and that point, and that
tube, and everything

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:24.660 align:middle line:90%
are all connected to this point.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And the image
first appears here.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, an instant
later, appears

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.000 align:middle line:90%
in the big one out around you.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is all
that creation is.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Once it appears in this
big sphere out here,

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:90%
it's in the outer world.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.120 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing is an illusion.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But that's where the image
actually is is around you.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
it is in reality.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:38:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Unlike this way of
creating where you're

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:04.050 align:middle line:84%
creating from the brain,
anything you get from here

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:90%
has to come to logically.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.726 align:middle line:84%
And you will find
out how it does.

00:38:08.726 --> 00:38:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you create
from this way using this

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:84%
while you're in your heart
space, there's no logic.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have things
appear out of nothing.

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:21.730 align:middle line:90%
You will see it happen.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:26.080 align:middle line:84%
No one else in existence
will ever know it happened.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:33.100 align:middle line:84%
However, when you get beyond
a certain size of creation,

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
the prerequisite is

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.120 align:middle line:84%
is where this size
changes exactly,

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.440 align:middle line:84%
but it's pretty
much anything that's

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.340 align:middle line:90%
affecting you and your body.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can heal
yourself from this way.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can affect small
things that are around you.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But the moment
you go into things

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that are bigger
outside of your family

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and going out into the world, it
requires three people minimum.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Three or more.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be one male, two
females, or two females and one

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:90%
male.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It's this thing that
we talked about before.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Making a human baby takes a
mommy, a daddy, and the baby.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And the baby can
be male or female.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:90%
And so this is how it works.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.470 align:middle line:84%
You will see that
this is really true.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you do understand
all of this, and you do it,

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and you see it's
true, you're not

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.230 align:middle line:90%
going to be human much longer.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:31.750 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Your evolution is just
going to go straight up.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go really
fast and very soon.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And don't make a
big deal out of it.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not important.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
step of consciousness.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:52.006 align:middle line:84%
It works because
when you're in here,

00:39:52.006 --> 00:39:53.130 align:middle line:90%
you don't have an ego here.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And this eliminates the ego
during this time completely.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:90%
What happens is this.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of funny,
but it's true.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:84%
If you create from this
other way over here,

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
ego is totally involved
in this, completely.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.652 align:middle line:84%
But in this one here,
when you're in your heart

00:40:12.652 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're bringing
an image forth,

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.110 align:middle line:84%
normally, if you're in a
normal state of consciousness

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and the heart tries to bring
an image to the surface,

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:84%
the ego says, no
way, I'm in control.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Get out of here.

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And it won't let the
heart do it, just refuses.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But when the heart
does this and becomes

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.090 align:middle line:84%
male and through the
sexual energy of this,

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and begins to fire
alpha, and the brain goes

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.510 align:middle line:84%
into joy and pleasure, and these
things are linked in there,

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:84%
the ego is so much in pleasure
it basically says to the heart,

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.794 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, anything you want.

00:40:49.794 --> 00:40:51.156 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:40:51.156 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.600 align:middle line:90%
You can have it.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.230 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:90%
And it allows it.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Where it would never
allow it normally,

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:84%
it will allow it under
these conditions.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're here permanently,
there's no more ego.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And anything that you do
is going to come directly

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.900 align:middle line:90%
into the surface.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And that is the ancient way.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.080 align:middle line:90%
This is how we always were.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.380 align:middle line:84%
This is how we were
before we fell.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.410 align:middle line:90%
We lived in our hearts.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And we used our brain remotely.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.310 align:middle line:84%
It was like a remote
thing that we used.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was a function
of the heart.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.740 align:middle line:84%
But we lost it when we left
here and moved up to here.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Then, the ego was developed.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
what's happened.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:36.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a catastrophe.

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Look at our world.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's trying to kill each
other because everybody thinks

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.411 align:middle line:84%
that they're more important
than somebody else, which is not

00:41:46.411 --> 00:41:46.910 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.370 align:middle line:90%
We're all equal.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Even in the spiritual
hierarchy of the universe,

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:84%
the higher you are, the more you
know that all people are equal.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.487 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we look at people
like Buddha, and Muhammad,

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus, and people
like this like they're

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.190 align:middle line:90%
really important people.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.760 align:middle line:84%
They might be
important in the sense

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.440 align:middle line:84%
that they brought
something forth to us.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But are they more important
than the universe?

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe so.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.010 align:middle line:84%
If there was a
drunk in the gutter,

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:84%
totally smashed and
drunk, he's just

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.030 align:middle line:84%
as important as
anyone else because he

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:30.027 align:middle line:84%
has God in him just like Jesus,
or Muhammad, or or Buddha,

00:42:30.027 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:90%
or Lao Tzu, or anyone else.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And so these ideas of we're
better than someone else

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.890 align:middle line:90%
is just a bunch of garbage.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's what's caused
all the destruction

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and pain and everything
else in the world.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:84%
If we were all doing this
and we were living here,

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:49.410 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
problems in the world.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.420 align:middle line:84%
When we know exactly what
to do to solve the problems.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.312 align:middle line:84%
We just don't want
to do it, you know.

00:42:55.312 --> 00:42:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look what
happened in New Orleans.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.020 align:middle line:84%
We didn't go in there
and solve those problems

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.790 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't
think it was, I feel,

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.030 align:middle line:84%
because it was
mostly a black place.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:09.340 align:middle line:90%
And a poor, black place, too.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.960 align:middle line:84%
If it was black Beverly Hills,
it would've been different.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.459 align:middle line:90%


00:43:17.459 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
all over the world.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We just don't care because
we only care about ourselves.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.490 align:middle line:90%
And that is a brain function.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's not normal.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:90%
It's an illness.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.481 align:middle line:90%
It's a disease.

This is to give you the
overview of how this all works.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Then, we're going to
have to go through it

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and practice it and go
through all the various steps

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.397 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:43:43.397 --> 00:43:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we
get it all together,

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.810 align:middle line:84%
we'll go outside in a beautiful
place, and do the final thing.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.640 align:middle line:84%

be able to do it.

[LAUGHING]

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:84%
This is all a male way
of do-- in other words,

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.400 align:middle line:90%
this is what actually happens.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But a female doesn't have
to know these details.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.840 align:middle line:84%
She just has to
understand the basics.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, a pure female
could sit there and just

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.427 align:middle line:90%
say, OK, do this, you know.

00:44:19.427 --> 00:44:22.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.500 align:middle line:90%
And it happens with her.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.350 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing just lines
up, and does all the things,

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.210 align:middle line:90%
and it works.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:30.810 align:middle line:90%
But the male can't do that.

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:33.650 align:middle line:84%
He's got to go step, by step,
by step, by step, by step.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So the female can just look at
the map and say, oh, I get it.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, arrive
there very easily.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So my wife does it
all through imagery.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Same way you get
it in the heart.

I'm having us leave the
brain, go to the throat,

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:46.770 align:middle line:90%
go down, and move in.

And that's a very
male way to do it.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:51.630 align:middle line:84%
She would just have
you-- I actually

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:58.350 align:middle line:84%
don't know what she would do
because she's really female.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.637 align:middle line:84%
And she would have an image
that you would step into.

00:45:01.637 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it,
through just images,

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.310 align:middle line:90%
you would be in your heart.

00:46:07.755 --> 00:46:10.160 align:middle line:84%
has created hundreds
of thousands of these,

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and they know it and
of other universes

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.630 align:middle line:90%
different than this one.

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can just
go inside of these.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.140 align:middle line:84%
They're put in
different crystals.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And you go inside the
crystal and, poof, you're

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.350 align:middle line:90%
in another world.

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:25.900 align:middle line:90%
But it's like a holodeck.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the closest thing we have
that's like what we're in.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can get into the
science or the physics of what

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:37.320 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the
images of how it's arranged

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But from a female point
of view, who cares.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>No, my question
was creating things

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:49.020 align:middle line:90%
that are to please the ego.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, if that's
going to the heart

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.260 align:middle line:84%
to create things that
are from the ego, that

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.740 align:middle line:90%
works the same way?

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Well I didn't quite
understand that.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, so if you'll
go create money.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.365 align:middle line:90%
You'll go create relationships.

00:47:04.365 --> 00:47:08.020 align:middle line:90%
You go create stuff.

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.580 align:middle line:90%
That's ego creation.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Not necessarily.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>If it's only pleasing you.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Well still not necessarily.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>No?

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're using this
technique, it's definitely ego.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you
create from there

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a problem,
as we talked about before.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:30.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're living in your
heart, if you exist here,

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're not anywhere else,
that's where you're existing

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and you reconnect this
back to the brain,

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.030 align:middle line:90%
there's no ego involved.

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.815 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this is what I
meant by you can do it or not.

00:47:42.815 --> 00:47:47.750 align:middle line:90%


00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.430 align:middle line:90%
We are these things?

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:53.221 align:middle line:84%
I swear slides are
so much better.

00:47:53.221 --> 00:47:53.762 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:53.762 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.722 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh yeah, here it is.

00:47:58.722 --> 00:48:00.982 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:48:00.982 --> 00:48:03.110 align:middle line:90%
It's hiding in plain sight.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Here, you can either
use attention or not.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.100 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in the
heart, if you're actually

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:18.020 align:middle line:84%
in the heart, when
you're in that space,

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.200 align:middle line:90%
you don't have an ego.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Whether you realize it or not,
you may pull images to you.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's for the greater
good of your family

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.000 align:middle line:90%
or all people in life.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.890 align:middle line:84%
You come from a different
point of view, you know.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.170 align:middle line:90%
You can still pull money.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Claudette
is amazing at that.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.955 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's pulled in
unbelievable amounts of money.

00:48:40.955 --> 00:48:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I think
I'll go make some money.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And she just sits
down, and there it is.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:53.880 align:middle line:90%
But doesn't care about herself.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:57.310 align:middle line:84%
She only does it for her
family or for her animals.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.490 align:middle line:90%
She loves her animals.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see what I mean.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But when you go
down here and then

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.060 align:middle line:84%
you enter in like
we did yesterday.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But then, usually
within minutes,

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:16.137 align:middle line:84%
we're right back here again
because the ego pulls us back.

00:49:16.137 --> 00:49:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep going down
there, keep going down there,

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.460 align:middle line:84%
keep going down there,
eventually, the ego

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:90%
gets weaker and weaker.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:22.790 align:middle line:84%
This get's stronger
and stronger.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.581 align:middle line:84%
And then, that point
happens where you have

00:49:24.581 --> 00:49:26.050 align:middle line:90%
this orgasm that takes place.

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And you are linked
here, at that point.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And at which point, it's
really easy to do this.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:41.206 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing it when you're
not fully established here,

00:49:41.206 --> 00:49:42.830 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you even
jump back and forth.

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:44.760 align:middle line:84%
How many people felt
themselves doing that?

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.135 align:middle line:84%
You're down here, and up here,
and then you're back here,

00:49:47.135 --> 00:49:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're back here, and
you're going back and forth

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:54.520 align:middle line:90%
because it scares the ego.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.550 align:middle line:84%
The ego really resists you
going in there, usually,

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:05.310 align:middle line:84%
because it knows it's, kind of,
like a separate being from you.

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Sometimes in
Kundalini yoga, you're

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:13.630 align:middle line:84%
instructed to look
how you instructed

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:18.060 align:middle line:84%
through the third eye or
sometimes through the back,

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes to the nose,
and sometimes to the chin.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you know the differences?

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I haven't studied-- I
mean, I knew Yogi Bhajan,

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.680 align:middle line:90%
one of the instructors.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to go
study with him on that.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do it because of the
violence associated with it.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And my heart just
wouldn't let me do it.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the instructors

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I was supposed to go study with.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.960 align:middle line:90%
And then, I just couldn't do it.

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Sikh's were
attacked by the Hindus

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:58.810 align:middle line:90%
a long, long time ago in a war.

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up leaving
three Sikh's left.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And they just said this
would never happen again.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they've developed
this fear that's within them.

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And so with Yogi Bhajan,
you go and study with him.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And you also have to
learn how to kill people.

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.780 align:middle line:84%
You basically learn how
to shoot machine guns,

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and throw hand grenades,
and crawl through this--

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.990 align:middle line:90%
it's like military.

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
they don't ever want

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to be-- if there ever
attacked again, they're

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:31.760 align:middle line:90%
going to be prepared.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
he's wrong or right.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I just, personally,
didn't want to do it.

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I never
was able to really understand

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:43.130 align:middle line:90%
the full levels of that.

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.230 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that he was
involved with the chin.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that they
rotated to the nose, which

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.180 align:middle line:90%
is another chakra.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.055 align:middle line:84%
Or down to the chin,
which is another chakra.

00:51:55.055 --> 00:51:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Or they're coming out the
back, which you have two

00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.640 align:middle line:90%
of these coming out the back.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.460 align:middle line:90%
So you have another eye.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.560 align:middle line:84%
You can turn this eye so
it looks out the back,

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.600 align:middle line:90%
as well as out the front.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
all that is about.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I got it.

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:19.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, but you know, I'd
like to talk to you.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:24.740 align:middle line:90%


00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is too is that when

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:84%
this green light
turns into a spiral,

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:31.730 align:middle line:84%
there's other things
it could turn into,

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.890 align:middle line:90%
just so you don't get shocked.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:37.160 align:middle line:84%
The other one is that sometimes
it'll make concentric rings.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.770 align:middle line:90%


00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And it'll do that kind
of thing and lock down.

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Another one is and I've
only seen this once,

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.850 align:middle line:84%
but I've had other people
see it, it forms a mandala.

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:55.497 align:middle line:84%
Inside here is this really
intricate Hindu mandala.

00:52:55.497 --> 00:52:56.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looks like.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, a smaller one
forms inside of that one.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Same one and then a smaller
one forms inside of that one.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And it does the same thing
with this, only with a square.

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one that
actually happens with me

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:17.280 align:middle line:84%
more now where it forms a
hole that is kind of like this

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:84%
if you think of this as
a tube going through.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:23.665 align:middle line:84%
A tube is formed
between here and here.

00:53:23.665 --> 00:53:26.340 align:middle line:90%
And you see right through it.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it connect.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.010 align:middle line:90%
There may be something else.

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:33.255 align:middle line:84%
But these are the only four that
I've ever experienced myself

00:53:33.255 --> 00:53:35.040 align:middle line:90%
that I've seen.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.940 align:middle line:84%
This one, though, from
talking to lots of audiences,

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:41.050 align:middle line:90%
it's about 90% or more.

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Of all the people,
this is what they see.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:46.340 align:middle line:84%
It does this thing
when it gets in there.

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:49.280 align:middle line:84%
This is what enables the
creation to come forth.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Usually, when this
is set up, you're

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:58.930 align:middle line:84%
seeing this through the pineal
gland itself through the brain.

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, people
used the third eye

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.160 align:middle line:84%
with a brain function,
not with a heart function.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that, just
like you can create just

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.370 align:middle line:90%
through the brain.

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:84%
You can also use this third eye
to create through the brain.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:18.710 align:middle line:84%
What I've given you so
far is the basics of this.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
whole area that I'm just

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:26.750 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about right
now for a little while.

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.470 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to
go into great detail

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:29.594 align:middle line:90%
because it's not necessary.

00:54:29.594 --> 00:54:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:39.820 align:middle line:84%
In essence, this
sphere is one of three.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.040 align:middle line:90%
And I mentioned this before.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.100 align:middle line:84%
In the sacred geometry
of the human body,

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:46.142 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see
there's five spheres that

00:54:46.142 --> 00:54:46.766 align:middle line:90%
go all the way.

00:54:46.766 --> 00:54:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But the center one
and the top two

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:52.415 align:middle line:84%
form this pattern
and a connection.

00:54:52.415 --> 00:54:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
describe it visually.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you took another sphere
that just touches this one,

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:04.640 align:middle line:84%
same size as this one, come
like that through the body,

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and then another one that
comes underneath here,

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:12.260 align:middle line:84%
the sphere that's under
here is connected directly

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.150 align:middle line:90%
to the heart.

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:15.900 align:middle line:90%
The middle sphere.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And the one directly
underneath that

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.880 align:middle line:84%
is connected to,
primarily, the uterus.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So now when you talk about
the one on the bottom,

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:30.400 align:middle line:84%
you have to talk about a male
and female in sexual union

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and put them together
and use both components.

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But what it's focused on is
the uterus within the female.

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And the heart has the
ability-- one more thing.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:49.870 align:middle line:84%
There's an access point to
all three of these spheres.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And all three of
them are, basically,

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:55.140 align:middle line:90%
a vesica piscis or a vagina.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.970 align:middle line:90%
The bottom one is obvious.

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.540 align:middle line:90%
It is a vagina.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that
there's eight tubes that

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.040 align:middle line:90%
come out similar to this.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And you really
begin to understand

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.860 align:middle line:84%
what the penis-- how
it relates inside

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.990 align:middle line:84%
of those things--
and it's an extension

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:11.930 align:middle line:90%
through the tubes itself.

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.085 align:middle line:90%
It's directly connected.

00:56:13.085 --> 00:56:18.020 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And with the heart, the
opening to the heart,

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.590 align:middle line:90%
is the solar plexus.

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
actual physical solar plexus,

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:27.340 align:middle line:84%
it's a vesica piscis
that looks like a mouth.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's opening.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's another opening,
it's another vagina opening,

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:35.280 align:middle line:90%
that goes up into the heart.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.066 align:middle line:84%
This is blocked in
almost everybody.

00:56:38.066 --> 00:56:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It's so rare to find
anyone that doesn't have

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:42.290 align:middle line:90%
their solar plexus blocked.

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
families and our weird situation

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.516 align:middle line:90%
with egos and everything now.

00:56:47.516 --> 00:56:50.700 align:middle line:90%


00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:51.830 align:middle line:90%
The heart has 10 beams.

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:54.350 align:middle line:90%
It has this one also.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:55.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's very flexible.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.420 align:middle line:90%
The heart can choose.

00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It can either go up and
connect with this upper sphere

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.700 align:middle line:90%
in this way.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Or it can go down and
connect with the genital area

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and create in an
entirely different way.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's another
creation process that

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.650 align:middle line:84%
has to do with breathing in
something that we're not even

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.690 align:middle line:90%
associated with, this one here.

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you go down, that's the
one that requires three people.

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's where you can,
actually, create anything.

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.900 align:middle line:90%
No limit whatsoever.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
create a galaxy.

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.680 align:middle line:90%
And I've had this experience.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.850 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it happen.

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.200 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.710 align:middle line:90%
You can create anything at all.

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:46.800 align:middle line:90%
There's no limit.

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely none between the
creation processes there.

00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But the angels are telling me
that that's not appropriate

00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:55.130 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:57.480 align:middle line:84%
That we don't need to
create another planet.

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.960 align:middle line:84%
We just need to fix
the one we're on.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this does.

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.170 align:middle line:90%
This is pure creation.

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:10.010 align:middle line:84%
This is, I would say,
it's like adjustments.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.800 align:middle line:84%
You can make minor adjustments
within the creation

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.170 align:middle line:90%
through this.

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:16.084 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't create
a planet up here.

00:58:16.084 --> 00:58:17.000 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually
clean up the entire oceans

00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:23.010 align:middle line:84%
in a breath or eight
breaths, actually.

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.500 align:middle line:84%
You could change
everything in the world.

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.490 align:middle line:90%
You can do alterations of stuff.

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:30.160 align:middle line:84%
You can adjust
things, fix things,

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.180 align:middle line:90%
but you can't do the big things.

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:35.130 align:middle line:84%
That requires the
uterus to do that.

00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when the heart goes up
in this level up here, which

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.550 align:middle line:84%
is all we're talking
about now, they

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:43.100 align:middle line:84%
wanted me only to focus
on that because that's

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.420 align:middle line:90%
what we need now.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:49.010 align:middle line:84%
When we get through this and we
get into the fourth dimension,

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:51.269 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get a much
taller body, a bigger brain,

00:58:51.269 --> 00:58:53.060 align:middle line:84%
we're going to understand
a whole lot more,

00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and we'll know how to
do the whole thing,

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:56.910 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be on another level.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:58.610 align:middle line:84%
But all we need
to do now is just

00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:02.670 align:middle line:84%
get out here and get into
this other room, kind of,

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:06.180 align:middle line:84%
this other place where
everything from there on in

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.520 align:middle line:90%
is automatic.

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.720 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
problems at all.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.780 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
correct this mistake

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:17.390 align:middle line:84%
we made 13,000 years ago
so that we can get back

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to living here, the power
place and the creation

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.710 align:middle line:90%
place of everything.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I could go on
for days really, and literally

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.620 align:middle line:84%
days, just on
what's in the heart

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and what's possible
through that.

00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.610 align:middle line:90%
You will discover it yourself.

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it will
come through memory

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:41.390 align:middle line:84%
because once you get
back to this place,

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:44.190 align:middle line:84%
your memory is going to slowly
come back or maybe quickly.

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.995 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:59:44.995 --> 00:59:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But your memory's
going to come back.

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.357 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
remember everything.

00:59:47.357 --> 00:59:49.440 align:middle line:84%
You're going to remember
who you really are, where

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.940 align:middle line:90%
you came from, everything.

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And why you're here,
what this is all about,

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and as we make these
changes into the higher

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.330 align:middle line:84%
dimensional worlds, you're
going to remember having

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:04.770 align:middle line:90%
made these changes before.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:09.950 align:middle line:84%
That is all going to seem
a totally natural thing.

01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's really
nothing to be afraid of.

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:14.490 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
be concerned about.

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:16.430 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
be worried about.

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's going to make it.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Whether you want to or not,
you're going to get there.

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the only thing
you have to do right now

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.890 align:middle line:90%
is just do the best you can.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
That's all that is required
is just the best you

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:34.550 align:middle line:84%
can because the best that
you can is perfect for you.

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.587 align:middle line:84%
And just do the best
you can in this,

01:00:36.587 --> 01:00:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and the best you can in
everything else like that,

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:41.670 align:middle line:90%
and it'll all come about.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:42.920 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.936 align:middle line:90%
OK, you got a question?

01:00:46.936 --> 01:00:48.087 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

01:00:48.087 --> 01:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
This question isn't designed
to challenge your abilities

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.336 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

01:00:51.336 --> 01:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But if it's possible to clean
up the oceans with four breaths,

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
or eight breaths or whatever,
why don't people like yourself

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
or someone else in that
consciousness, why don't they

01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:01.930 align:middle line:90%
do that?

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>For me, this is not my job.

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I've done things that are pretty
huge but only because I was

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:15.270 align:middle line:90%
asked to from my higher self.

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not here to do
any kind of changes.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm only here to tell you
something about yourself.

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
You're the one that
has to do this.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.220 align:middle line:90%


01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.760 align:middle line:90%
But I can give you examples.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.195 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like,
oh, I don't know.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:46.056 align:middle line:90%


01:01:46.056 --> 01:01:49.570 align:middle line:84%
This is, sort of, a
stupid one, I guess.

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:51.425 align:middle line:90%
It's like how I got my house.

01:01:51.425 --> 01:01:53.291 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:01:53.291 --> 01:01:58.261 align:middle line:90%


01:01:58.261 --> 01:02:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's
a good one or not.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of them I can't talk
about because they're

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
stuff I'm dealing
with that we've

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
done things that are
global that are stopping

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.650 align:middle line:90%
wars and stuff like this.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But I can't really-- I
started to talk about some

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:17.285 align:middle line:90%
of that stuff.

01:02:17.285 --> 01:02:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll just talk about this one.

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:20.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a little thing.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It's just a house.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.250 align:middle line:90%
But it'll explain it.

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:25.550 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Payson.

01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:28.940 align:middle line:90%
And I had a house there.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:33.760 align:middle line:90%
We paid $240,000 for it.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
a lot of money.

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I didn't at that time anyway.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And we decided we
wanted to move here.

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:49.550 align:middle line:84%
When you move here, that same
house here would be close to 2,

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:55.585 align:middle line:84%
2 1/2, million dollars because
that house was 4,500 square

01:02:55.585 --> 01:02:56.460 align:middle line:90%
feet, I think it was.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Three stories high with 2
1/2 acres, a horse ranch,

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:02.290 align:middle line:90%
and an unbelievable view.

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And it was gorgeous.

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And that here would be
really, really expensive.

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So when we moved here,
we had to downgrade.

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Go up a lot in
price and downgrade.

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was really difficult
to do this because I

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.640 align:middle line:90%
don't want a mortgage.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to pay it off.

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we were looking at it,
we found a house that we liked,

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:27.020 align:middle line:90%
it was $900,000.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:32.456 align:middle line:84%
And it was much smaller
and everything else.

01:03:32.456 --> 01:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
But it was the same problem
no matter what you did.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
They're all expensive
here compared

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
to where compared to
where I was coming from.

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:46.270 align:middle line:90%


01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And this house didn't even
have nothing on the outside.

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It was just dirt.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.370 align:middle line:84%
It hadn't been
completely completed.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:58.320 align:middle line:90%
And so we went back home.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.707 align:middle line:84%
And Claudette and I
says, well OK, that's it.

01:04:00.707 --> 01:04:01.540 align:middle line:90%
We need to get that.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:02.581 align:middle line:90%
But how we gonna do that?

01:04:02.581 --> 01:04:04.820 align:middle line:90%
And I go, I don't know.

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Then she says,
meditation, let's go in.

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And we did this in meditation.

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:13.210 align:middle line:90%
And it was only the two of us.

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:15.100 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't a third component.

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.380 align:middle line:90%
But this was small.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
This is, kind of, personal
and it works on small things.

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And three days later,
this woman drives up.

01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have a For
Sale sign on our house.

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Drives up, knocks on
the door, and says,

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.850 align:middle line:90%
I really like your house.

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Are you willing to sell it?

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And my wife thought
she was a realtor

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and told her to go away.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.167 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:04:42.167 --> 01:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
She goes no, no, no.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
She says I want
to buy your house.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a realtor.

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:48.890 align:middle line:90%
And so they started talking.

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And so in the meantime,
the house was $899,099.

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And the guy was going bankrupt.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And he dropped it to $750,000,
which made it a little easier

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
but still might as
well been $8 million.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:05.615 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't afford it.

01:05:05.615 --> 01:05:09.590 align:middle line:90%


01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:12.205 align:middle line:84%
So she comes up and
says-- we were just

01:05:12.205 --> 01:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
into the middle--
she says, look,

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.487 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a check
for $750,000 right now.

01:05:17.487 --> 01:05:18.888 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:05:18.888 --> 01:05:21.230 align:middle line:90%


01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:22.630 align:middle line:90%
We will take that.

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:24.466 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:27.220 align:middle line:90%


01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we will.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.707 align:middle line:84%
And so she was happy
because she thought

01:05:30.707 --> 01:05:33.081 align:middle line:84%
she was going to have to pay
a lot more for it because it

01:05:33.081 --> 01:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
looks like a very
expensive place.

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
she really knew what

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:38.190 align:middle line:90%
houses sold for over there.

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:40.912 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't have to
appraise it or anything.

01:05:40.912 --> 01:05:41.870 align:middle line:90%
She just wrote a check.

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.449 align:middle line:90%
And so we did.

01:05:43.449 --> 01:05:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And I took the check back over.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Cashed it.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:45.780 align:middle line:90%
It was real.

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And we went back to this
place, put a thing down for it,

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and we offered them $740,000.

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And they took it.

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And the closing
cost was $11,000.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.805 align:middle line:84%
So the house I have
now cost me $1,000.

01:05:58.805 --> 01:06:00.126 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:06:00.126 --> 01:06:02.420 align:middle line:90%


01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.177 align:middle line:90%
And that was through meditation.

01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, it was
through meditation.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.920 align:middle line:90%
That's how we did it.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK because
of how we got it.

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to harm anyone.

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
As we find out now, she
has over $100 million.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So that didn't mean
anything to her at all.

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:20.780 align:middle line:84%
It was just what
her heart wanted

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.960 align:middle line:90%
because she was into horses.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And we had built a beautiful
horse facility there.

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was exactly
what she wanted.

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:29.670 align:middle line:90%
And so it didn't hurt her.

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:middle line:90%
It definitely didn't hurt us.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
got into Sedona.

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:37.630 align:middle line:90%
And I use this for everything.

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I know that in terms of you
can struggle through life

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and try to make things
happen, but if you live here

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:50.024 align:middle line:84%
and you just stay in this place
that whatever it is you need,

01:06:50.024 --> 01:06:50.690 align:middle line:90%
you can have it.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:51.320 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.350 align:middle line:90%


01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:00.470 align:middle line:84%
She decided that she wanted
to move her son to Sedona.

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:02.130 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to move here.

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:04.050 align:middle line:90%
And so she did this again.

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:07.419 align:middle line:90%


01:07:07.419 --> 01:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, this guy from Russia
came right after she did this.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.820 align:middle line:84%
This guy from Russia
came in and says,

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
you know, he would like to
hire her at $2.2 million a year

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.990 align:middle line:84%
to do this thing like how
I'm doing here right now.

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And that provided all the money
to buy her family a house here,

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and move them up here, and
everything else like that.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's no side effects
from it like on the other one.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.930 align:middle line:84%
This is totally
harmless to anyone.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.530 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just money.

01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:41.480 align:middle line:90%
It's anything.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
If you have a disease,
you can get rid of it.

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
You can bring
yourself into balance.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.780 align:middle line:84%
You can change
anything in your life.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.905 align:middle line:84%
But that's still
centered on you.

01:07:49.905 --> 01:07:53.970 align:middle line:90%


01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:55.360 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to do this.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, you eventually

01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
have to get to the
place where you're

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:04.310 align:middle line:84%
going to use this for the
world and for other people.

01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you understand this,
this is part of spirituality.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
When you really get this, you
can't keep this for yourself.

01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It's illegal.

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:13.370 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't be given
something of this value

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:19.340 align:middle line:90%
spiritually and just to hide it.

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:22.779 align:middle line:84%
You have to use it for the
good of all life everywhere.

01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that,
then you keep growing.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:28.479 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do that,
you will lose it.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just the
nature of the reality.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's OK to do that.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:38.609 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you're
going to have to give out.

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why I keep
doing these things.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I keep giving to you because
I've been given this.

01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I can't keep it.

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.995 align:middle line:90%
I have to give it to you.

01:08:45.995 --> 01:08:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And it has to go out.

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:48.661 align:middle line:84%
And the times going to
come when all of you

01:08:48.661 --> 01:08:51.279 align:middle line:84%
when you really get to this
level and understand you're

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.945 align:middle line:84%
going to have to go
out and help others.

01:08:52.945 --> 01:08:55.462 align:middle line:90%


01:08:55.462 --> 01:08:58.399 align:middle line:90%
It just is the way it is.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%
But it's good.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Giving is how you receive.

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the
nature of reality.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
The more you try to
hold back, the more

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:11.300 align:middle line:90%
you don't have anything.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
The more you isolate yourself,
and then you're poor,

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.330 align:middle line:90%
and you can't move anything.

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was
first learning spirituality

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.649 align:middle line:84%
and I was just
connected to the angels.

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to
give everything away.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I wrote
about this or not.

01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:30.289 align:middle line:84%
But I gave everything
to everybody.

01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, here.

01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
You can take this.

01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:32.590 align:middle line:90%
You can take this.

01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:33.950 align:middle line:90%
You can have this.

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:36.945 align:middle line:84%
And the final thing, I
had this car, this RV,

01:09:36.945 --> 01:09:37.819 align:middle line:90%
that I was living in.

01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:40.141 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm going
to give that away, too.

01:09:40.141 --> 01:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I gave it, the
guy just couldn't believe it.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.845 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're
giving me your car?

01:09:44.845 --> 01:09:46.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, take it, please.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But every time I
would give stuff away,

01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:53.569 align:middle line:84%
I would get money coming
back from some other way.

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:55.532 align:middle line:90%
And finally, I gave up.

01:09:55.532 --> 01:09:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't give it away because
the more I gave it away,

01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:01.910 align:middle line:90%
the faster it would come back.

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:03.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's just karma.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.220 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But seldom do we
have the courage

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
to be able to step
over into that world.

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:14.464 align:middle line:84%
We're usually so afraid that
we're going to lose everything

01:10:14.464 --> 01:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
or we're not going to
be able to pay our bills

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
or something like that that
we stay frozen in this place.

01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like the monkey holding
the apple in the jar.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And they won't let go of
it, and they would be free,

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:26.020 align:middle line:90%
but they won't.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And so most of the world is
sitting around in that way.

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And even if they knew
this, a lot of people

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have the courage to
be able to really step over

01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:39.430 align:middle line:84%
into that totally free place
where you're just connected

01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:41.110 align:middle line:84%
straight through God
to do everything.

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:44.240 align:middle line:90%


01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.446 align:middle line:90%
You have to become fearless.

01:10:46.446 --> 01:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all
the ancient ones

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, and the
Incas and the Mayans,

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
they've all done
these things to when

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:56.500 align:middle line:84%
they get the initiatives
that are going to this level

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to become fearless where
you don't care if you die.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.564 align:middle line:90%
You don't care.

01:11:00.564 --> 01:11:01.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not about caring.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you're
not afraid to die.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You're not afraid to step
over into another way of being

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:13.300 align:middle line:90%
because you have to do it.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.040 align:middle line:90%
It's 100%.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.160 align:middle line:90%
You have to go all the way.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I hope you take
this to the level where

01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:26.040 align:middle line:90%
you can see that it's true.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.290 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to experiment.

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can experiment on small
things, little things that

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't hurt anything,
and see it happen,

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
builds your confidence
up, and then go

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:40.160 align:middle line:90%
for something a little bigger.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But this is a case where
size doesn't matter.

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess it does in
terms of whether you're going

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:49.710 align:middle line:90%
down or up in this procedure.

01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But up in this here, you can
do small things or things

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.300 align:middle line:90%
that are bigger.

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But from here, if three
people came together,

01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and they focused on
the oceans, and they

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:03.420 align:middle line:84%
were fearless in the
state, and they really

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
understood what they do,
they could get all the carbon

01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:06.900 align:middle line:90%
dioxide out.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.691 align:middle line:84%
They could bring the
oceans back to the way

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:12.260 align:middle line:90%
they were in more recent times.

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe, and the angels
have told me this is true,

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:21.310 align:middle line:84%
that we cannot ascend until
we clean up the earth.

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:24.600 align:middle line:90%
We have made a mess here.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.406 align:middle line:90%
We've done so much damage.

01:12:27.406 --> 01:12:28.530 align:middle line:90%
So what are we going to do?

01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Go to another planet and
destroy that place too?

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn how this
creation process works to be

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.040 align:middle line:90%
able to go to the other levels.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But before we leave, we have
to use this to bring everything

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:45.410 align:middle line:90%
back into a perfect balance.

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:47.150 align:middle line:90%
And then, we can go.

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And that may happen over a
very short period of time,

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.200 align:middle line:90%
like a day or two.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Very quickly the world gets
it together, we understand,

01:12:55.490 --> 01:13:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and we solve the problems,
and then we choose to leave.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:02.815 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:13:02.815 --> 01:13:03.781 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

01:13:03.781 --> 01:13:08.620 align:middle line:90%


01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, for those who
experience that as technical,

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
could you briefly tell us
the female way to do that.

01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm not female so it's really
hard for me to tell you that.

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I wish my wife was
here because she

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
knows more about
this than most people

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.410 align:middle line:90%
in terms of how to do that.

01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's
lots of people that

01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:34.310 align:middle line:90%
understand as much as she does.

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:37.360 align:middle line:90%
But she does have it down.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's different.

01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
As much as I've tried to
understand what she's doing,

01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:45.440 align:middle line:90%
I still don't really get it.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And I still have to
map everything out.

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just who I am.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the way it is.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.640 align:middle line:90%


01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But for her, when I talked
about the Blue School,

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I've told you about
everything I know.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And she does know how
to use the images.

01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But to her, you're
just an image.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything is just an image.

01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And anything you create
is just an image.

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just the idea
if you understand

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that the outer
world, and the body,

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and the inner world, and all
of it is just consciousness.

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Reality is consciousness.

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Then, it begins to make sense.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:29.120 align:middle line:84%
If you think it's
real, then it becomes

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
more complex of how
you change things.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you keep bringing
yourself down to your heart,

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and you feel that
you're in your heart,

01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're step by step through
your life and in the waking

01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
dream from your heart, and
you're feeling the energy,

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:51.320 align:middle line:84%
the prana, and you're intending
to connect with all life and do

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
the will of the universe or
the will of the connection

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
in the heart, and you're
aware about the basics about

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the Merkaba, and the beams of
light, and the pineal gland,

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.710 align:middle line:90%
that would be--

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Well there is something
more that she does.

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:14.840 align:middle line:90%
She understands all that.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
understand what

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
it is because she's brought
back the ancient world

01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:21.740 align:middle line:90%
into modern times.

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So she's brought a way
of being, and thinking,

01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and perceiving from 6,000 years
ago into the 21st century.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's different.

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I try
to understand, I've

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:38.200 align:middle line:84%
given up now because
I don't understand

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
how she uses these images
the way that she uses them.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense to me.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I know it works.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I could see that it works.

01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I've had classes
where I've had her.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
We used to work together
for a long time.

01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And I would start in with this.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, I would turn it
over to her for a couple days.

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And she would be doing
all this imagery work.

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, aw man,
it's easy for me after that.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just after
that I could just

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
fly because the people
get it on another level.

01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Without her, it's much
harder for me to do this.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.730 align:middle line:90%


01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:21.502 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking about
this this morning, actually.

01:16:21.502 --> 01:16:23.710 align:middle line:84%
She was just saying this
morning that maybe we should

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:27.740 align:middle line:90%
get back together and teach.

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:31.375 align:middle line:84%
But in a way, I think
it would, kind of,

01:16:31.375 --> 01:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
be better if there was
back to back workshops

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.730 align:middle line:84%
because mixing those two
things back and forth

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
is, kind of, confusing
for a lot of people.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But if she gave
a workshop first,

01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
it's better if she does
it first and get everybody

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:48.160 align:middle line:90%
into their heart.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And they know what that is,
and they're already there.

01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Then, it's really easy for
me to connect everything

01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:58.549 align:middle line:90%
back together after that.

01:16:58.549 --> 01:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because we haven't
talked about it in a long time.

01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:03.423 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking about
it this morning at breakfast.

01:17:03.423 --> 01:17:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I just wanted to say a thing
or two about your influence

01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.900 align:middle line:90%
on mankind.

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know indirectly
there's a lot of things

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
necessarily speak on.

01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But directly, there's
a lot of people

01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:15.477 align:middle line:90%
that are using your work.

01:17:15.477 --> 01:17:17.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
giving you credit.

01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Most aren't.

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many
things, especially

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.330 align:middle line:90%
with the flower of life.

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's work with
electronics and just things

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.682 align:middle line:84%
that aren't really
coming to surface.

01:17:25.682 --> 01:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like
you're just going

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
to be another one
of those people

01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that most people won't
really appreciate

01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:31.320 align:middle line:90%
as much until they're gone.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'll speak for myself.

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, your influence with me
and geomancy and body art.

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've just completely
transformed my outlook

01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
on marking people based on your
knowledge on the sacred sites

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and our influence on
the planet with it being

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
its own organic structure,
the Gaia theory, and stuff

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:53.350 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:57.415 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

01:17:57.415 --> 01:18:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And you definitely deserve a lot
more credit than you're given.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.500 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:10.140 align:middle line:90%


01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>But it doesn't really matter.

01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%


01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.230 align:middle line:84%
What does it really matter
if we know who it was

01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:21.920 align:middle line:84%
or who it wasn't that
started these things.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like almost everything-- I
was talking to someone-- almost

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:28.840 align:middle line:84%
everything that's going on
today in terms of psychology

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.920 align:middle line:84%
didn't come from
Jung or from a Freud.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.920 align:middle line:90%
It came from Wilhelm Reich.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And Wilhelm Reich, you could
trace almost every single thing

01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:43.760 align:middle line:84%
from-- I can't even think of the
names of the stuff right now.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But almost every single
psychological process

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that's going on goes
back to Wilhelm Reich.

01:18:51.210 --> 01:18:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Yet, most people
don't know that.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
idea about that.

01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:57.850 align:middle line:90%
But the effect is the same.

01:18:57.850 --> 01:18:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And all that really
matters is the changes

01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:02.040 align:middle line:90%
that take place in people.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know, but I
don't really care myself.

01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:09.780 align:middle line:90%


01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.990 align:middle line:90%
You got to do it.

01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:12.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
in the same position.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.850 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
know all this stuff.

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
doing this stuff.

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, your higher
guidance is going to come in

01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, you
got to give it back.

01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start either with
family, or starting out,

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.050 align:middle line:90%
or teachers, or whatever you do.

01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't so much
who it is or how it is.

01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It only matters that we wake
up and we remember who we are.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's all that really
matters is that, really.

01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:43.470 align:middle line:90%


01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:49.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me quickly
see the time again.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's 1:06?

01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>1:00.

01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>We're late.

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:57.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, we got to a good
place right now.

01:19:57.730 --> 01:19:59.200 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go to lunch.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.549 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back, that's when

01:20:01.549 --> 01:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start
practicing everything.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll go out
and do the final thing.

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:27.934 align:middle line:90%
