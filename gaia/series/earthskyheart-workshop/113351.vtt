00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>This is day three,
the day of the mind.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.526 align:middle line:90%
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Good morning.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>This is day three,
the day of the mind.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
finish day two right now.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It'll take about 10, 15
minutes or something.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:84%
This is very important, what
happens right now relative

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.140 align:middle line:90%
to yesterday.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
We didn't do this
for a long time.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It was the angels
that created this.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:84%
But just to give credit
where credit's due,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.530 align:middle line:84%
the actual procedure
that makes this work

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:90%
came out of the Philippines.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's a psychic way
of sweeping that is

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.539 align:middle line:90%
pretty amazing actually.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:90%
to build a pyramid in here.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And we begin a vortex.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Takes a little
while to develop it.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Takes a few minutes.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon there's
like a sheet that's

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:90%
sweeping around this room.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And it'll move right through
you and it's kind of like glue.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
If anything that
you want to let go,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:84%
you just got to hold it there
and it'll take it from you.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.202 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Just-- it's gone.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And it goes up and goes
out through the apex

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.296 align:middle line:84%
into another
dimension, actually.

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But to the entities that may
still be here, a lot of times

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.929 align:middle line:84%
they get nervous and
don't decide not to do it

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:90%
when they really want to.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.415 align:middle line:84%
And then you sleep overnight
and they go, oh god, I

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:90%
wish I had done that.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Here's another opportunity.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if they just let go
right now, they can go out

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and archangel Michael will
make sure they get home.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.895 align:middle line:84%
So for you guys
it's really easy.

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do anything
except lay on your back

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:90%
and just listen to music.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of strange music.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
This is a strange workshop, so
I gotta go find strange music.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't use the Grateful
Dead or anything.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you do.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You pick a center point and
you put all of your heads

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
into the center point and you
lay on your backs, just kind of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.588 align:middle line:90%
like a wheel.

00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:33.008 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
You guys are having
too much fun.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Just relax and begin to breathe.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Feel the flow of prana
coming from above and below,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
meeting in your heart
chakra, from your merkaba.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And just feel that flow and
just keep breathing and feeling

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:90%
that flow.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And if any feelings come
up or anything, just

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:90%
let them come up.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And whatever's
behind that feeling,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
just with your
inner vision, just

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:84%
bring that up and lift it
out of your body if you can

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
And just feel it.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.031 align:middle line:90%
Just take it.

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
It's moving right
through your body,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:84%
so it'll take anything
you let go of right now.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And when the music is
over, I'll lead you there.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:90%
So I think we can begin now.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.408 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.404 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:29.404 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Slowly come back to your bodies.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the day of the
mind or the day of the brain.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to define the
brain and mind differently.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Some people think they're
sort of the same thing.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
My definition is
going to be the brain

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:84%
is the physical organ,
physically the brain.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
The mind is what we're
walking around in right now

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:90%
in this room.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the images
that it generates.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to
understand what this is,

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:84%
it's very different than
what almost all human beings

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.110 align:middle line:90%
on Earth think is the truth.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
And so as you
begin to hear this,

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:84%
it'll sound strange-- in
some ways, almost crazy.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you continue
with the meditation,

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:84%
you will come to the
place where you'll be

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.800 align:middle line:90%
able to prove this to yourself.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
You'll know for sure
what I'm talking about.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:90%
It usually takes a while.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in the
traditional methods,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.075 align:middle line:90%
it usually takes 20 to 40 years.

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:04.499 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.499 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to get it
down to like tomorrow maybe.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.694 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.694 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But you'll probably be
able to get this usually

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:90%
within a few months, if not.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
20 to 40 years.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
We may not even
have a few months.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:84%
It literally could
happen now, any minute.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like we're
really into the accelerated

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:90%
motion of this whole thing.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But I can't second
guess mother earth.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know for sure.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:90%
So today is the brain.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow is the physical heart.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Physical.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
The physical brain and
the physical heart.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And the physical heart
also has image just

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:90%
like it has a mind also.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look at
the differences between these

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
so we can understand
how consciousness works.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually going
to map the whole thing.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:17.622 align:middle line:84%
Most of this information has
been kept somewhat secret.

00:10:17.622 --> 00:10:20.087 align:middle line:84%
In fact, especially
the heart work,

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
there's almost nothing
written about in the world.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Never has been.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It's always been
an oral tradition.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And so on we will be
breaking some of these rules.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to go
fast as possible.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're also going to give you
very direct information, which

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
will save you-- it'll save
you, in this room right now,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
in the past anyway, about
one third of the people

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:84%
were able to jump from
the 20 to 40 years now.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of them usually
take a little bit longer.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:04.190 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to do things that
usually take a very long time.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It's partly because science has
been mixed in with meditation.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:84%
This may sound
funny, but you would

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.447 align:middle line:84%
think the ancients would have
a better understanding of some

00:11:15.447 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:90%
of this stuff.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.790 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Even the great
white brotherhood,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:84%
when they tried to understand
about the opening of the eye

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
when you actually read what
they're saying, where they've

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
written it down, it's clear
that they did not actually

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
understand the physiological
nature of what was actually

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:90%
They were guessing.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But they were people
just like you and me.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Any difference.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
They were going through
the same stages awareness

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are right now
and then finally understood it

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:90%
and were able to do it.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But whoever wrote these things
for them, I didn't really know.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:84%
When we get to that
point, we'll explain it.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:90%
But that'll be today.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Today some time.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to talk
about the-- first of all,

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to present to you
that the brain is not

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:90%
as important as the heart.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.525 align:middle line:90%
The heart is much older.

00:12:19.525 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It is prior to.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
It happened-- before there was
a brain, there was a heart.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And we'll explain that.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
But the ancients were
very much aware of this.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
If you go back
into ancient Egypt,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:84%
when they mummified
body, usually a king

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
or queen and sometimes
a doctor-- people

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
they considered more important.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do it with everyone.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:84%
They did it only
with certain people.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
They would remove all the
organs out of the body.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they had
four clay jars.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And they would put the organs
in a very specific order

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
inside of those four jars,
except for three things.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the brain, the
heart, and the genitals.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And everything else
was put in there.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And then what they
did with the heart,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
they put it back into the
body, because it was essential.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And also the
genitals, because when

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:84%
you understand what we're
about to talk about,

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.735 align:middle line:84%
the heart and sexual energy
are the key to creation.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You cannot create without
those two aspects.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.856 align:middle line:90%
What did they do with the brain?

00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:84%
They pulled it out
through the nose

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and they threw it
in the garbage can.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.020 align:middle line:84%
That's how important
it was to them.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Why would they think that?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Why would they think that
the brain was just useless?

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet they're coming from
closer to the time when

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:90%
we were really aware.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:57.536 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when
where we're going, we were.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's the reason why
the universe has given us

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.837 align:middle line:84%
the permission to
synthetically recreate

00:14:06.837 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
this level of consciousness
within you is because you've

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:90%
attained it once before.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:90%
At least humanity has.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.965 align:middle line:84%
And individual in
here may not have,

00:14:14.965 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
but humanity has
attained this before.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it's going to take
me awhile to explain this.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I can just
rattle off a couple sentences

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:90%
and it would make sense.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I will say this one thing
just so you understand this.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
If you go back into
conception-- like I

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.417 align:middle line:84%
think in one of
the books-- I don't

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:90%
remember which one it was.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
first book, I think,

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
where we showed the geometry
related to conception--

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
starts out as the sphere,
which is the ovum.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:15:00.242 align:middle line:84%
Then the 10, 11, or 12
sperm come in and conceive.

00:15:00.242 --> 00:15:02.075 align:middle line:84%
And then it breaks into
two through mitosis.

00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:04.408 align:middle line:84%
And then it breaks into four
and it forms a tetrahedron.

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it breaks into eight
and forms a star tetrahedron.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes into tetrahedron
around a tetrahedron at 16.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps going
until 512 cells.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And it forms toroidal field.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So it goes 512 cells and it's
hollow inside and everything.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:90%
And I left it there.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
But since then,
I've done a lot more

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
studying with medical doctors
that have explained this to me,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
but what that
becomes is the heart.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And there is a point in
every one of us, all of us,

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.029 align:middle line:84%
where we were just a
heart and nothing else.

00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:90%
We had no arms, we had no legs.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
We had no liver
or anything else.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:90%
We had no brain.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
We were just a heart
and nothing else.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the body
came out of the heart.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:84%
The body was an image that
the heart had created.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it literally
came out slowly.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
emerged out of it.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the heart was pushed
in and pulled into the body.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we became this
more traditional image

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:84%
that we think of ourselves, as a
little fetus beginning to grow.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But intuitively, you
can see from that,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that the heart is older and
more primal than the brain.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:90%
The brain came afterwards.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
The more you begin to
understand this relationship

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:84%
between the brain and
the heart, the more

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:84%
you see that, if you're looking
for the source of things,

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.227 align:middle line:90%
you don't go to the brain.

00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:90%
You go to the heart.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to shift
subjects a little bit

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and go into what we began
to talk about yesterday

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and how the brain is
affected by belief patterns.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it believes to be
true is what it's capable of.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's also like a wall.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.714 align:middle line:90%
It's like a cage.

00:17:09.714 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your
belief patterns are,

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
they form a particular
shape and that's it.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:17.050 align:middle line:84%
You can't get out that
field because you've

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
created this image around it
that won't go any further.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.028 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like the
story with Jesus and Peter

00:17:24.028 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about yesterday,

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:29.360 align:middle line:84%
where Peter was able to walk
on water until he had a doubt.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And then he went into water.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go back
to quantum physics again.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And not with the world
being either solid particles

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:90%
or, on the other side, energy.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But rather this idea
that was presented

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
through quantum physics
that the experimenter

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.413 align:middle line:90%
affects the experiment.

00:17:55.413 --> 00:17:58.724 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.724 --> 00:17:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, just think about that.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
How could an experiment--
if this reality is

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:84%
truly separate from us and on
its own, running without us,

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
then how can one person do an
experiment and another person

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
do an experiment and get a
totally different result.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
It can be completely
180 degrees apart.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what you
believe when you're doing it.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like going back
into the '60s where

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:84%
you had 20 million people in
the United States taking LSD.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.496 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, our government
did all kinds of experiments

00:18:40.496 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:84%
on this and they
came up and said

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:84%
there was chromosome
breakage and lots

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and lots of negative things
that they were finding.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's because our
government was really,

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:51.867 align:middle line:90%
really down on this.

00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying it's good or bad.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.382 align:middle line:90%
It's just they were.

00:18:54.382 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But the Canadian government
was different about this.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
They had different
feelings about it.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they came in they did
extensive research on LSD.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And I mean really extensive.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And after many
years of research--

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
it was headed by David Suzuki
at the University of British

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Columbia.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And the report was handed
to Premiere Trudeau,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:90%
who was in charge at that time.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And what it stated in there
was they couldn't duplicate

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
anything that the Americans
had done and didn't believe

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:90%
it was true.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And the final result was that
they discovered, they believed,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that taking LSD was
less physiologically

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:84%
harmful to the body than
taking a single aspirin.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a whole
different point of view.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And while we're going
to get into this more

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
because hidden inside
of this little thing

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:84%
about the experimenter
affects the experiment

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:90%
is something huge.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Really huge.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at science
itself, and especially physics,

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:90%
they know that's true.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'll even get into
it a little bit more

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:84%
in a moment what they
do know about it.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But mathematics to a physicist
or to a mathematician

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:90%
basically is their god.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that whatever math
says, that's got to right.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Has to be.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:90%
There's 2 plus 2 equals 4.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Can't be anything else.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:84%
In so as the mathematics
has evolved over time,

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
it has along with it
is the reflection of it

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
as what we perceive as
our theories in physics.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened
along the line

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
is that there's
become anomalies,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:84%
incredible anomalies,
that have happened.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And so much so at
this point that

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.220 align:middle line:84%
if you really understand
math and physics,

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:90%
ours physics is dead.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:90%
It cannot make it.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
It will die eventually
and it cannot keep going

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're freaked out about
it, a lot of people are,

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:84%
because they know
they can't keep going.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We've got to a
certain level and it

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:84%
looks like we're going great,
but there are real problems.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk about some of
these problems in a little bit.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But because they believe it
is, they came to a place--

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
when this was, exactly.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just going to guess.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I think it was about in the
'50s, where it became really

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:84%
scary for the mathematicians
and the physicists

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
because it was clear
that they had made

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:84%
a huge mistake
somewhere and they

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
didn't know-- they knew
where some of them were

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't know if they
knew where all of them were.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to invent
something that didn't exist.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And if they couldn't find
this thing that didn't exist,

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.339 align:middle line:90%
it was all over.

00:22:17.339 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And they would literally have
to start over like a baby

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:90%
and begin again.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to
balance their equations,

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
they had to find, at the
very, very, very, very edge

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
of the known universe,
these huge, huge things

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:90%
that they called quasars.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But no one had ever seen
a quasar ever before.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It was just this idea that what
would fit into the mathematics

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and then make everything work
so they could keep going.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:90%
But nobody had ever seen one.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But they were told, the
astronomers were told,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
we gotta find it because
it's there somewhere.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you had all
these people looking

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
in the space for something
that no one's ever seen.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:90%
And it went on for years.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.155 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:11.745 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:11.745 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen one before.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.902 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:15.902 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.339 align:middle line:84%
But one day, one
man-- that was a man.

00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't matter if it
was a man or a woman,

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
but it was this guy-- he
sees a quasar way out there.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:84%
At that time, it was probably
about 10 billion light years.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We're at about 17 billion
light years I think now,

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
where it was exactly.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:90%
But he finds one.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And they're huge.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:90%
They're enormous.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're polarized with
these giant streams coming out

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
of the north and south pole
of them and everything.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.417 align:middle line:84%
And they break the
laws of physics.

00:23:51.417 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
They have to break
the laws of physics

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
to put our laws of
physics back into balance.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the very next day, you
can just see all the telescopes

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:84%
on the whole side that's
facing that were all

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:90%
turning to that place.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're going wow, there
really is a quasar up there.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon the whole
world is going, wow, it's true.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:90%
We've been saved.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:90%
We found the quasar.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, what was very interesting
was the immediate time

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:32.410 align:middle line:84%
after that suddenly they begin
to see quasars everywhere.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:90%
All over the place.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Millions of them.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Why did we never
see them before?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.740 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
The experimenter
affects the experiment.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:84%
They should have added
the words "big time."

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.128 align:middle line:90%
And then time went on.

00:24:57.128 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And the theory
still didn't work.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Mathematics and everything.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:90%
And there were still problems.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.450 align:middle line:84%
The problems were almost
always with gravity,

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.199 align:middle line:84%
because they really
don't-- at that time--

00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:84%
have even the slightest
idea what gravity was.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of their theories
from our understandings

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:90%
now are just completely wrong.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.275 align:middle line:84%
And so the same way with
special theory of relativity

00:25:21.275 --> 00:25:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and relativity and even quantum
physics and everything else.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the gravity which
is the biggest problem.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
real problems are.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And so then they started
developing the superstring

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.510 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And the mathematics of
that evolved to a point

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:90%
where they had to stop also.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they'll ever
prove superstring theory,

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:84%
but that's just my
personal opinion.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But the mathematics
evolved to a certain point

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
until they are also stopped
in a similar kind of position

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't go
any further unless they

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
saw these blue lines
running through space.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Nobody had ever seen a blue line
running through space before.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no blue lines out there.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, they convinced astrologers
to-- I mean astronomers.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.772 align:middle line:84%
Astrologers could probably
find it quicker, actually.

00:26:20.772 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Astronomers to look
for the blue lines.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.390 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, everybody's
looking for blue lines

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere they're
looking, they're

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:84%
looking to see if they
can see these blue lines.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And it never happened
for a long time.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And finally one person, I don't
know if was male or female,

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:43.140 align:middle line:90%
sees a blue line in the sky.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
The very next day, all the
telescopes look up there.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Same thing again.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Wow, there it is true.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.550 align:middle line:90%
They really do exist.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, wow,
they're everywhere.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
How come we never saw
these things before?

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
We are creating our
universe as we go.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And so slowly I'm going to
explain what the universe is.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.799 align:middle line:84%
I said in the first part,
it doesn't really exist.

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:10.715 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:27:10.715 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
In essence, the concept
that is the closest

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:84%
in human consciousness is in
"Star Trek" as the holodeck.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:90%
We live in a holodeck.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Only there's no holodeck.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the brain itself
that's creating it.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And we think that it's
real because it looks real

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and you can touch it and feel
it and all that other stuff.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.670 align:middle line:90%
But it's not real.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And what all that stuff is,
it's not separate from you.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:90%
It is consciousness.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Reality is consciousness.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:51.147 align:middle line:84%
And if you come at it
from that point of view,

00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:53.480 align:middle line:84%
you'll begin to understand
what the ancients are talking

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:84%
about in meditation
and kundalini and kriya

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:84%
yoga and all these
other things, you

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand
what's happening.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, as long as
you think it's real

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's really there,
you'll never get there.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:90%
You'll be lost forever.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
actually exist.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And there was another person
who became famous for awhile,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately I
don't his name anymore.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But you could trace this one
down if you really wanted to.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:84%
He had a little black box
and a pad in front of it

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
with like a joystick
that he created.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.144 align:middle line:84%
And you could put
anything on there.

00:28:34.144 --> 00:28:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't working
on magnetic fields.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.680 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have to
be steel or metal.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:84%
It could be a piece
of wood or plastic

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.510 align:middle line:84%
or steel or anything at
all, and he could just

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.222 align:middle line:84%
turn this machine on and
just lift it up in space

00:28:46.222 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:90%
and float it around the room.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Make it fly anywhere with no
apparent power or anything.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing coming
from this at all.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And scientists were going crazy
over this one for a long time.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was is that
when any other scientist would

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.490 align:middle line:84%
sit down-- and all you had to do
is just turn it on like a game

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:90%
and play-- it wouldn't work.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:90%
It would only work for him.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:90%
It's psychotronic.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:84%
He'd linked with the machine
and was able to make it do it

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and the other scientists
could not do that.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason
why in science

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:84%
even though somebody invents
something and it's awesome

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and it works perfect,
they say we don't care.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:84%
There has to be at least
two independent universities

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
can duplicate that.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%
If they can't duplicate
it, we can't use it

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's not real as far
as they're concerned.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And usually they want more.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And then even when
they do, the politics

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.140 align:middle line:84%
are so powerful in science
that it doesn't override it.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:90%
For example, cold fusion.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:84%
We were told that those two
guys invented cold fusion

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and then the atomic
industry said absolutely no.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And there was this war that
actually went on around this.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they finally came
up and said it's not true.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:16.079 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't exist.

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:17.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what everybody was told.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.770 align:middle line:84%
There's now been 22 universities
that have duplicated this.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:90%
It does work.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But they won't let
it out, for politics.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It is real, but they
won't even let it ago.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:84%
In terms of a free energy,
personally, just me,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I've seen over 40 vacuum
machines in the world

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:90%
all working perfectly.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.216 align:middle line:90%
Some better than others.

00:30:47.216 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Some huge and
making a little bit

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:84%
of energy and some little
making a lot of energy.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But like I said before, when
you're talking about energy,

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:84%
there's so much energy in
just a cubic centimeter

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that you can create the
entire universe with.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it came from
the ideas that we

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:90%
have of the Big Bang theory.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.030 align:middle line:84%
We came from infinitely
small-- not infinitely small,

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.580 align:middle line:84%
but extremely small
little spot that

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.230 align:middle line:84%
created-- the energy that came
out that created everything

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.780 align:middle line:90%
that we see.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And so we have machines.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I have machines
right now sitting

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:84%
in California that would solve
all of our energy problems

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow morning.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And on every single
level of our existence.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:90%
And our government knows it.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.630 align:middle line:84%
They told me in 1998
that I could put this out

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.776 align:middle line:84%
and we did up the
final steps and then

00:31:43.776 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I was told I had to go
before the secret government

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:90%
to get permission.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:90%
So I had to go to Switzerland.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And in Switzerland, these giant
hotels, 2,000 rooms and stuff.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:84%
They guy just rented the entire
place and made everybody leave.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And he went into
the cafeteria, which

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.810 align:middle line:84%
would hold-- I don't know
how many people, but a lot.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.152 align:middle line:84%
And he made them
remove all the tables

00:32:09.152 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and he put one table in
the middle of the room.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we had our meeting.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.855 align:middle line:84%
And he listened to
everything I had to say.

00:32:16.855 --> 00:32:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And he got done.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, ah,
go ahead and do it.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.960 align:middle line:84%
We knew this was going
to happen anyway.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I got really excited about
because it was a pretty awesome

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.060 align:middle line:90%
thing that we had.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we got the permission
and we came back and then

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:84%
we perfected it and then
the FBI came in and told me,

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:90%
no, I'm sorry.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.694 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:32:45.694 --> 00:32:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't tell
us why for a long time.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And eventually about six
months later, they did.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And that was because they
said that if we put out

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:84%
free energy what the computer
models show is that it will

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:84%
absolutely crash
the entire stock

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.100 align:middle line:90%
market for two to three years.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And about 100 to
300 million people

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
will die just in
the first 90 days.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're on
heroin or something

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and we have to get off of oil
and all these other things

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.570 align:middle line:90%
and it hurts to get off of them.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.690 align:middle line:84%
But they were
willing to do that.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But then they found out
about the environment.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:84%
They knew about the
environment since the '60s,

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
know how bad it was.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And right before the
turn of the century,

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.190 align:middle line:84%
they begin to realize
what the truth was.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And they just said we can't
deal with both of these things

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And they shut us down,
wouldn't allow us to do it.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But we have a
little boxes that's

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.930 align:middle line:84%
nine inches on each
side, black, sealed.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:84%
One moving part that
doesn't touch anything.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And the side effect
is it creates

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:90%
2,000 horsepower for eternity.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's just runs your
lights and everything.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.090 align:middle line:84%
The main thing is it's
an anti-gravity field

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and it really works
and it absolutely works

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's perfect.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's silent.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And that little tiny device will
lift 24,000 pounds into the air

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.260 align:middle line:90%
at any speed you can imagine.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:84%
You could take a
24,000 pound spaceship

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and put it in a space like
an elevator, if you want.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Just to go really slow.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Be very comfortable.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.265 align:middle line:84%
You're only going
up 100 miles or so.

00:34:26.265 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:90%
It's no big deal.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:84%
If you went 100 miles an hour,
you'd get there in an hour

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and you could have
tea on the way up.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you get out
of the atmosphere,

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.250 align:middle line:84%
this thing will accelerate, at
least mathematically, to 9/10

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.290 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light in
less than three minutes.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.369 align:middle line:90%
It'll really move up.

00:34:45.369 --> 00:34:46.949 align:middle line:90%
We can't survive that.

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways
you can maximize this

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.429 align:middle line:84%
and we've already
figure those things out.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We can get to Mars
instead of nine months,

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:84%
we can get there
very, very quick.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have
gravity the whole way.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.630 align:middle line:90%
You've feel normal.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So politics are a big thing
when it comes to energy.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.710 align:middle line:90%
It's really too bad.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I was the one, though,
that went to become--

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:20.994 align:middle line:84%
the emperor of Japan, he's
made a relationship with me.

00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Put it that way.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't make one with him.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And his whole purpose he
told me is to save the world

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:90%
environmentally.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what they want to do.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And so he's very interested
in these kinds of things.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we gave exactly how
to make a car run on water

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.409 align:middle line:90%
to the Japanese, which they did.

00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know this or not.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They put it out to the
whole world through Reuters.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They actually are
demonstrating that they

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.360 align:middle line:84%
can run an automobile
just converting water

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:90%
into hydrogen and oxygen.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:84%
We had a car here in Nevada that
will, on one gallon of water,

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:90%
will go 3,200 miles.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.820 align:middle line:84%
That's how much more power is
in water than it is in gasoline.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:14.410 align:middle line:84%
They were only able to get
a mere 400 miles per gallon.

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the method they're using.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.980 align:middle line:84%
They're using the
fuel cells theory--

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.022 align:middle line:84%
their way of doing it
is they're converting

00:36:22.022 --> 00:36:24.230 align:middle line:84%
it into chemicals and over
and then into electricity.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And you lose a lot of
energy doing it that way.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
They came out with the car
almost a year and half ago.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But Japan then
decided not to do it.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Toyota was going to do it.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:84%
They were all going to come
out of with a water car

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and then they decided
not to because

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.930 align:middle line:84%
of the solar panel, what
they're about to release.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.560 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese have
a solar panel that

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
is almost as good as
what I just talked about.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
ant-gravity with it.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.590 align:middle line:84%
They discovered it by
accident, but it's a plastic.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And the plastic is 70% to
80% efficient on light.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:09.720 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:84%
The most efficient are--
these big silicon cells

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have are 9%
to 12% efficient.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And recently they made
one that's 15% efficient.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.780 align:middle line:90%
This is 70% to 80% efficient.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's 70% to 80%
efficient on infrared,

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.803 align:middle line:90%
so it works day and night.

00:37:27.803 --> 00:37:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It'll work in Alaska in
the middle of a snowstorm.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And if that isn't enough, the
plastic is the perfect battery.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a solid state plastic.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:90%
No liquids.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:90%
No nothing.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.460 align:middle line:90%
No acids.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's better than any
battery we've ever seen.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And so this cell can produce--
well, just three of them

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.690 align:middle line:90%
would run a huge American home.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And they shouldn't cost
more than $100 each.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's almost there.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:02.220 align:middle line:84%
But the plastic can be
turned into a paint,

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.374 align:middle line:84%
and that's why the automobiles
want to paint their cars.

00:38:05.374 --> 00:38:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they're a solar collector
no matter where they are.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Put the plastic in
there and now you've

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.771 align:middle line:84%
got a car that will
run day and night

00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and never stop ever,
until the tires run out

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:90%
And we have this.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.900 align:middle line:90%
This exists.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided
the water car was not

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.800 align:middle line:90%
as good as this one is.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I get to talk about
this guy in Canada.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:27.580 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
Canadians here.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
say his last name.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.300 align:middle line:90%
So maybe you guys can help me.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Who knows French here?

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It's P-O-M-E-R-L-O-U.
P-O-M-E-R-L-O-U. Pomerlou?

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.925 align:middle line:90%


00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:90%
His first name is Denni.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.160 align:middle line:90%
And this guy is amazing.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just got to
talk about him,

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's all about
this thing we're still

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.830 align:middle line:84%
on of the experimenter
affects the experiment.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.949 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was 10
years ago when I first

00:39:10.949 --> 00:39:12.240 align:middle line:90%
heard about him, approximately.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Maybe more.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.051 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.290 align:middle line:90%


00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.837 align:middle line:84%
And there were scientists going
up and seeing him all the time

00:39:19.837 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand what
he was doing, because he

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.930 align:middle line:84%
was doing things that were
impossible by everybody's

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.360 align:middle line:90%
standards.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And they never could
understand what was going on.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.340 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
read their textbooks

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.670 align:middle line:84%
very well about the experimenter
affects the experiment.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:41.740 align:middle line:84%
But this was a man who at the
time was about 50 years old.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:90%
He must be older now.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what he is.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:49.100 align:middle line:90%
But his internal age was a 12.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.170 align:middle line:90%
He was just a kid inside.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.803 align:middle line:84%
And what he told me was
that his teacher was 5.

00:39:53.803 --> 00:39:58.270 align:middle line:90%


00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And he had a great fear that he
might someday become an adult.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.210 align:middle line:90%


00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Because he didn't want to.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:11.890 align:middle line:90%
And so he chose electronics.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.430 align:middle line:90%
But he chose electronics.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.212 align:middle line:90%
And so I traced him down.

00:40:18.212 --> 00:40:19.170 align:middle line:90%
It took me a long time.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.753 align:middle line:84%
It actually took me
almost three years

00:40:20.753 --> 00:40:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to find this guy,
because he hides.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And I finally found him
and I went to his house

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.072 align:middle line:84%
and asked him if he would
show me what he was doing.

00:40:28.072 --> 00:40:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
excited to show me.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he spent about two
or three hours showing me

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.740 align:middle line:90%
what you had.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is really cool.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really is.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And I could see why
the scientists were all

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.490 align:middle line:84%
going in there engrossed to
understand what he was doing,

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:84%
because he broke every rule
in electronics that there

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.050 align:middle line:90%
is just about.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when he got all done
I said, this is very cool.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.422 align:middle line:84%
And I said, would you come to in
my workshops and show it to me?

00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what I find out.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:90%
He's also superstitious.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.120 align:middle line:90%
He will not cross a bridge.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.290 align:middle line:84%
He will not get in an
airplane or a boat.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.037 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.037 --> 00:41:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember all
the restrictions,

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.280 align:middle line:84%
but it limited him to
a very specific area.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.030 align:middle line:90%
You can't leave there.

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:22.967 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to do my
workshop in that area

00:41:22.967 --> 00:41:23.800 align:middle line:90%
or he couldn't come.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.660 align:middle line:90%
So I did it.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
It was up near
Quebec, where it was.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.940 align:middle line:90%
And so we did it.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And it was so cool.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you in a
little bit what he did.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm first going to
show you what he did.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:54.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
this out here somewhere.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Can everybody see this?

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it over there?

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like a
slice on the edge.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Colors.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So he had these electrical
circuits and a long time ago,

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.644 align:middle line:84%
people accused him
of putting wires

00:42:13.644 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:84%
inside the wood that he
made them on and everything.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So he made them on acetate
so you could see through it.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
show you the-- when

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.890 align:middle line:84%
he came to the workshop, the
first thing-- I just turned it

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:25.880 align:middle line:90%
over to him.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I went in the back of
the room and watched

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:28.840 align:middle line:90%
and he just sat up here.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.548 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
he said to everybody,

00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:84%
is there any electrical
engineers in the class?

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:90%
There were three PhDs.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Three.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:38.790 align:middle line:90%
He got so excited.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.581 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was going
to pee in his pants.

00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:41.286 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:41.286 --> 00:42:42.660 align:middle line:84%
He goes, wow,
that's really good.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.451 align:middle line:90%
That's really good.

00:42:43.451 --> 00:42:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So he runs and he gets a table
and he drags it over right

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:53.250 align:middle line:84%
in front of where he is and he
says, you guys sit right here.

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And so these three
men, they sat down.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he brings out the first
board and it was really simple.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:07.230 align:middle line:84%
The first one was a
little thing about so big

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and it had a single
little light bulb on it

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.700 align:middle line:84%
with a wire that came over
with a switch that went over

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to a battery, only the
battery went like that

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and never finished the circuit.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:90%
So it kind of breaks the rules.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But it was just barely
breaking the rules,

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:29.280 align:middle line:90%
from his point of view.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he turns
on the switch and it works.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.936 align:middle line:84%
So he gives it to them and
he says, what do you think?

00:43:37.936 --> 00:43:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And they come up
with this theory

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that he's got
something wirelessly

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:84%
transmitting energy to it
or something else like this.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, OK.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So he comes up with
another one and he goes,

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.760 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more complicated.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And it has three
lights on it in series.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:90%


00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
to three switches.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:09.670 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes down here
and there's no battery.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little wire that
goes like that and ends.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't know what this
is and why it doesn't connect.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But he says this is
the power source.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But even if it was a power
source and it was connected,

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.770 align:middle line:84%
by electronics, you would have
to click all three switches on

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and all three lights
would come on.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:40.890 align:middle line:90%
But he says, oh no.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I didn't make it that way.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:84%
He says, this one
goes to that light,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.450 align:middle line:84%
this one goes to that light,
and this one goes to that light.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, that is
exactly what happened.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.240 align:middle line:90%
He turned this light on.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.220 align:middle line:84%
You got two more
switches in front of it,

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.180 align:middle line:90%
and that light goes on.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.070 align:middle line:90%
And so he hands them that.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.290 align:middle line:90%
He's got 18 boards.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:04.200 align:middle line:90%
This is the second one.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.950 align:middle line:84%
By the second one, they could
not explain this to anybody.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:90%
They were going, I don't know.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And he kept going.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Then he made another one
that was a little bigger

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and it had a little plug
that went over to a switch

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and then went over
to a really big coil.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Much bigger.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was plugging
chainsaws in here.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.222 align:middle line:90%
These million watt light bulbs.

00:45:40.222 --> 00:45:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Things that are so
bright they would just

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.100 align:middle line:84%
blind you if you ever saw them
and all this different stuff

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:44.933 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:45:44.933 --> 00:45:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And these guys couldn't
even talk after a while.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.900 align:middle line:84%
They were just
going, I don't know.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And he kept going.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.780 align:middle line:84%
More and more and more
and more and more.

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to skip all
the way up to the last one.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And on the last
one, he-- oh yeah.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.060 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to skip to
the last last one.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:25.120 align:middle line:84%
After he got all done, he says
let's use your stuff, he says.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody have a radio?

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Three or four people
ran out, came back

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.530 align:middle line:90%
with little boom boxes.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.214 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
just pick one.

00:46:33.214 --> 00:46:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And so they did.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.046 align:middle line:84%
And he says now we're going
to use your electricity.

00:46:36.046 --> 00:46:37.160 align:middle line:90%
So plug it into the walls.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So they plugged
it into the wall.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And then he says turn
it to a radio station.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.330 align:middle line:84%
He turns it and it's playing
music or whatever it was.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And so he then comes over
to the board like this.

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And he draws onto the
board their radio.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And he puts a
little aerial on it.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And he puts a wall-- he
puts the switch where

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.880 align:middle line:90%
it plugs into the wall.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And then he puts a little switch
right here in it, like that.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And he says, this
is your radio now.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.744 align:middle line:90%
And he says I'll show you.

00:47:19.744 --> 00:47:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And he goes over like
this to the switch

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.466 align:middle line:84%
and he goes-- and
the radio goes off.

00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:25.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:28.280 align:middle line:90%
He goes-- and the radio goes on.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.090 align:middle line:84%
There was dead
silence in the room.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.100 align:middle line:90%


00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.780 align:middle line:84%
He came two or three times
to two or three workshops.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And he kept doing it
and kept doing it.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:44.110 align:middle line:84%
He says, now I want to show
you something about yourself.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.034 align:middle line:90%
And he goes like this.

00:47:46.034 --> 00:47:47.200 align:middle line:90%
He did it about three times.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.530 align:middle line:90%
He goes now I got it.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.560 align:middle line:84%
He says now I have
a switch my hand.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
put it in my palm.

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:56.510 align:middle line:90%
So see, it's right there.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And he says if I click it,
radio goes off, radio goes on,

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.410 align:middle line:90%
radio goes off, radio goes on.

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:04.750 align:middle line:84%
He says, now I'm going to give
it to somebody in this room,

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and whoever I give
it to, they can do it

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and they can pass
it around the room.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to go
away and leave you

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:13.350 align:middle line:84%
so you know I'm not
psychically doing

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.016 align:middle line:84%
and I don't when you're going to
turn it off and on or anything.

00:48:16.016 --> 00:48:18.739 align:middle line:84%
So he gets out and he
runs down a long hall

00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:21.280 align:middle line:84%
all the way down at the far end
and gets into a broom closet.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.148 align:middle line:90%
He closes the door.

00:48:23.148 --> 00:48:25.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:26.810 align:middle line:90%
We're all going OK.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And then we close the door.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And this person is sitting
there and she goes, click,

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.940 align:middle line:90%
radio goes off, radio goes on.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.412 align:middle line:90%
And starts passing it around.

00:48:34.412 --> 00:48:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And every single
person in the room

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:38.410 align:middle line:84%
could control turning
the radio on and off.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I did, too.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.050 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in your
hand that you could see.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:47.319 align:middle line:90%
But with this, it would do it.

00:48:47.319 --> 00:48:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Just with your intention,
it would turn the radio

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.830 align:middle line:90%
on and off.

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.359 align:middle line:84%
And then he came
back into the room

00:48:52.359 --> 00:48:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and he says-- and
he was all excited.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:54.899 align:middle line:90%
And he says did it work?

00:48:54.899 --> 00:48:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Did it work?

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And everybody went yeah,
it definitely worked.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:00.374 align:middle line:90%
And he said oh, good, good.

00:49:00.374 --> 00:49:02.040 align:middle line:84%
He comes up and he
says, well-- and then

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.260 align:middle line:84%
he starts to say goodbye and he
goes, oh yeah, one more thing.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:09.680 align:middle line:84%
He comes over here and he takes
a little line off like that

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and he goes like that.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.590 align:middle line:90%
He goes, that's a microphone.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, hello.

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:18.550 align:middle line:90%
And it comes out the radio.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:21.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.205 align:middle line:90%
Honest.

00:49:23.205 --> 00:49:24.762 align:middle line:90%
It came out the radio.

00:49:24.762 --> 00:49:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can come up
here and talk in hear

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.178 align:middle line:84%
and their voice would
come out the radio.

00:49:28.178 --> 00:49:31.770 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:35.099 align:middle line:90%
It's not what we think it is.

00:49:35.099 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
reality here than we've

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:39.620 align:middle line:90%
been told by our mom and dad.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:44.000 align:middle line:90%
And so this guy's great.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually running
trips over to his house now.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Germany is, anyway.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Somebody in Germany
got excited and there's

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:53.380 align:middle line:90%
other people who are doing it.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.725 align:middle line:90%
He was caught.

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to his
manager, because he doesn't

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.280 align:middle line:84%
know about money
or anything and he

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.750 align:middle line:84%
has somebody else that
controls his-- so he can live

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:04.920 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And his manager was
telling me that he

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:12.280 align:middle line:84%
was arrested during the--
there was a blackout 10

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.290 align:middle line:84%
years ago or so in Canada,
in the northeast there.

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And his house was the only one
after a long, long, long time

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:18.742 align:middle line:90%
that was--

00:50:18.742 --> 00:50:20.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Still working fine.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:24.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:28.020 align:middle line:90%
And they arrested him for this.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.970 align:middle line:84%
They literally went to his
house and arrested him.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like, why?

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But he said that when
they were taking him out,

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:39.180 align:middle line:84%
they had handcuffs
on him and they

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.290 align:middle line:90%
were taking him out to the car.

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And he just got
completely freaked out

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and he did a thing
like master Joe.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.980 align:middle line:84%
He made his hands really little
and the handcuffs fell off.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And the policeman saw this and
they just jumped in the car

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.158 align:middle line:90%
and drove away.

00:50:55.158 --> 00:50:57.503 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:57.503 --> 00:51:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:04.180 align:middle line:90%
I did not see that.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.650 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want my handcuffs.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:14.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.610 align:middle line:84%
He was freaked out because they
had arrested him once before

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.290 align:middle line:84%
because he was walking down the
street with a lamp that was not

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:22.436 align:middle line:90%
plugged in, but it was lit up.

00:51:22.436 --> 00:51:24.751 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:24.751 --> 00:51:26.610 align:middle line:90%


00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:28.950 align:middle line:90%
And they put him in jail.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And in jail he asked
for a piece of wood.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And he drew a radio
on it, turned it on,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.415 align:middle line:90%
and was listening to the radio.

00:51:36.415 --> 00:51:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.550 align:middle line:90%
And they let him go.

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:44.366 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want him in there.

00:51:44.366 --> 00:51:47.204 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:52.542 align:middle line:90%


00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I used to have his phone
number and everything,

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.240 align:middle line:90%
but I don't have that anymore.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.830 align:middle line:90%
But you could find him.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:18.006 align:middle line:90%


00:52:18.006 --> 00:52:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Anybody know Slim Sperling?

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.835 align:middle line:90%


00:52:21.835 --> 00:52:23.270 align:middle line:90%
A few of you.

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:25.910 align:middle line:90%
He was a coil master.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:27.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was creating coils.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.420 align:middle line:90%
These are coils that he created.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I had a long talk with Denni
and he said to make this work,

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.820 align:middle line:90%
you just take a piece of copper.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Copper he says works
very well or something.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:45.140 align:middle line:90%
And you start coiling it.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And you coil it
until it comes alive.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.707 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes alive,
you stop, and now it's

00:52:50.707 --> 00:52:51.790 align:middle line:90%
connected to the universe.

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And he says you have infinite
energy and it never wears out.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And I know exactly
what he's talking about

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.130 align:middle line:84%
because in my years of working
with Slim, you have these coils

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and they don't work
until you turn them.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have to turn them
until they come alive.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it when they do.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I feel it right
here when they do.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:84%
You can also feel it-- or
if you can't feel it here,

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.301 align:middle line:84%
you can just listen
to the birds.

00:53:16.301 --> 00:53:18.800 align:middle line:84%
If you go outside and you do
this and you turn it just right

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and you get it just right,
all the birds start chirping.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:24.150 align:middle line:90%
And you'll hear them doing it.

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:25.840 align:middle line:90%
They can feel it, too.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway,
Slim knew this guy.

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.170 align:middle line:84%
That was how I found out
about him in the first place.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of Slim's
friends, which I

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:38.010 align:middle line:84%
don't have his name
anymore either,

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.670 align:middle line:84%
went and studied with
Denni for about four months

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.740 align:middle line:90%
is what I remember.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And he finally got this idea
of how you make these coils.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.390 align:middle line:90%
And so he did the same thing.

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:53.100 align:middle line:90%
He went back.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And Slim told me that he saw
this work-- I didn't see it,

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.520 align:middle line:84%
but Slim did-- where
he just went back home

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and he took a coat hanger,
took it and bent it around

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.060 align:middle line:84%
until it came alive,
plugged it into his house.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Unplugged the house, plugged
it in, and his house lit up.

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And all it was just
a piece of wire.

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And so we can do this.

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:16.714 align:middle line:84%
But we're coming to
a point right now

00:54:16.714 --> 00:54:19.130 align:middle line:84%
very soon where we're not going
to need any of this stuff.

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.755 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
need the technology.

00:54:20.755 --> 00:54:22.636 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
need the energy.

00:54:22.636 --> 00:54:24.010 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to need anything.

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:25.400 align:middle line:90%
You just need one thing.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.620 align:middle line:90%
That's your body and that's it.

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.420 align:middle line:90%
We all have one.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:33.190 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go a
little bit further

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.510 align:middle line:84%
to convince you of all
this kind of stuff.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit more.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in Peru a
long time ago, 1985 or '86,

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.150 align:middle line:84%
somewhere around in
there, I was walking

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:56.090 align:middle line:84%
in the Inca Trail from Cuzco--
well, not right in Cuzco

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:59.340 align:middle line:84%
but outside of Cuzco
up to Machu Picchu.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:02.560 align:middle line:84%
We were one of the first
people to ever do that.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.320 align:middle line:84%
The trail had just
been discovered

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.090 align:middle line:84%
about a month earlier,
maybe two months earlier.

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Very soon.

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And there was no provisions
for anyone to do this,

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:19.900 align:middle line:84%
so we had to take the
train up to Machu Picchu

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and we got to them to stop.

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And they stopped for 60 seconds.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was a train filled
with goats and chickens

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of people and
everything else like that.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.441 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't get through.

00:55:29.441 --> 00:55:30.680 align:middle line:90%
It was just packed solid.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.885 align:middle line:84%
We had to climb out windows
and throw our back pack out

00:55:33.885 --> 00:55:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and climb to get out
of these windows.

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the train went
on and the only way

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I could get across
the Urubamba River

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:47.320 align:middle line:84%
is there was just a cable
stretched across, two of them.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And you had to hold onto one
and walk over another one.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.210 align:middle line:84%
There's this little
tiny river down there.

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Get to the other side and
it was the Quechua Indians

00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:01.879 align:middle line:84%
who became our friends
and led us into there.

00:56:01.879 --> 00:56:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And the person who discovered
the trail was a man

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.230 align:middle line:84%
named Narciso, who
was a Quechua shaman.

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.360 align:middle line:90%
He's only about 35 years old.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.620 align:middle line:90%
And this guy was amazing.

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.890 align:middle line:84%
He was just like a
little tiny child.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:19.950 align:middle line:84%
He was so innocent on so many
levels and it was beautiful,

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I thought.

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:27.195 align:middle line:84%
And so we walked for
about 40 miles over up

00:56:27.195 --> 00:56:30.770 align:middle line:84%
to a little higher than
14,000 feet over the cliffs.

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:90%
We came down to Machu Picchu.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu was
about 9,000 feet.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.770 align:middle line:84%
We were dropping down
to get down to there.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we got there, we
all had different reasons

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:48.320 align:middle line:90%
why we were going there.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to go
to Huayna Picchu, which

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:52.970 align:middle line:90%
is a mountain peak there.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.904 align:middle line:90%
It's a very high, pointed peak.

00:56:54.904 --> 00:56:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
go on top of there

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.460 align:middle line:84%
because I'd heard
stories about this.

00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I climbed it and I got
on top and did that whole thing.

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.890 align:middle line:90%
And then afterwards, I was done.

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:06.309 align:middle line:90%
We were basically all done.

00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of
looking for-- and there's

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:12.340 align:middle line:84%
about maybe 400, 500 people
walking around in Machu Picchu.

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking for my people.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We were only, I think,
12 people or so.

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I saw Narciso and
a friend of mine way

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.810 align:middle line:90%
over sitting on top of a rock.

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:29.200 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they
had not reconstructed

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.980 align:middle line:90%
all the buildings.

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.394 align:middle line:84%
They were just maybe that
much of the building was left

00:57:33.394 --> 00:57:34.560 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of it was gone.

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Now they've rebuilt all these
buildings and everything

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.690 align:middle line:84%
so they look like the way
they think they looked.

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:44.284 align:middle line:90%


00:57:44.284 --> 00:57:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But to get to this rock
which was a big rick.

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It was about not quite
half as big as this room,

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:57.790 align:middle line:90%
12 feet high or so.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:59.340 align:middle line:90%
And they were on top of it.

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And to get to that rock, I had
to climb over these three foot

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:05.450 align:middle line:90%
high ruins to get over to it.

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And there were several of
these walls getting over

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.400 align:middle line:90%
to where this rock was.

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And these rooms were
where they lived.

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:16.085 align:middle line:84%
And Machu Picchu was a
female temple, by the way.

00:58:16.085 --> 00:58:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It was totally--
they found, I don't

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.880 align:middle line:84%
remember the exact number,
but about 700 bodies there.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of them were
female except for six.

00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it's pretty clear that
it was not a male temple.

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:30.950 align:middle line:90%
It was a female temple.

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I climbed
over these things.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:36.410 align:middle line:90%
I found my way up there on top.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:42.442 align:middle line:84%
And Narciso and my friend,
I don't think-- well,

00:58:42.442 --> 00:58:43.650 align:middle line:90%
his was first name was Bruce.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.400 align:middle line:90%
I won't say his last name.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And Bruce and
Narciso were sitting.

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And here's the edge of
the rock right here.

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And Narciso was facing
this way cross legged

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and Bruce was facing this
way out toward Machu Picchu.

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
a little ways apart.

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And they were both shamans.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Bruce was sent outside
of the United States

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:21.540 align:middle line:84%
to go to high school when he was
14 and they sent him to Iran.

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.690 align:middle line:90%
And so he studied there.

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:24.100 align:middle line:90%
But he never came home.

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So he lived in
over 40 countries.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.499 align:middle line:84%
So he was not an
American anymore.

00:59:28.499 --> 00:59:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what he was.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:30.960 align:middle line:90%
He was just a global person.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.870 align:middle line:84%
But he lived mostly
with indigenous people.

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So he really became a
shaman over his life.

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.489 align:middle line:90%
And both of them were shamans.

00:59:38.489 --> 00:59:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Bruce knew more about crystals
than any person on earth

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:42.200 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever met.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.390 align:middle line:90%
And I've met a lot of them.

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.390 align:middle line:90%
But this guy was amazing.

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And to talk a little bit
about Narciso, his innocence,

00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:56.780 align:middle line:90%
he had never been in a car.

00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.100 align:middle line:84%
He never been in a city
or anything like that.

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.500 align:middle line:90%
He'd only lived in nature.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.570 align:middle line:84%
On the way up there, we're
all wearing sunglasses.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And he kept looking at us.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Finally he said, why do
you guys wear those things?

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And we said, well,
it feels good.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
We go a little farther and
he goes, can I try one?

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So somebody gives their
sunglasses and puts it on

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:25.960 align:middle line:90%
and he goes, wow.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.730 align:middle line:90%
He's looking all over like this.

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was the
most amazing thing

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.060 align:middle line:90%
he'd ever seen in his life.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.630 align:middle line:90%
He was just blown away by it.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the person gave
him the sunglasses.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And he had them on.

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:39.765 align:middle line:90%
He went to sleep with them on.

01:00:39.765 --> 01:00:41.585 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:41.585 --> 01:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%


01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
This was high
technology for him.

01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just telling you
that story just to give you

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.880 align:middle line:90%
understanding of who he is.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
He really understands the power
of what you believe and what

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:58.640 align:middle line:90%
your limits and everything.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they both had
little shamanistic bags

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.560 align:middle line:84%
around their necks with
powered objects in there.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were showing
each other their toys.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.356 align:middle line:84%
And so they had a
little cloth in there

01:01:10.356 --> 01:01:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and Bruce would take out one
and he says I have this here

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and this came from Monaco or
somewhere and he'd put it down

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:16.912 align:middle line:90%
and just can I touch?

01:01:16.912 --> 01:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And he'd look at and he'd
say, what does it do?

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And then Bruce
would explained it.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
take one of his out

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:22.919 align:middle line:90%
and he says, well, I got this.

01:01:22.919 --> 01:01:24.301 align:middle line:84%
This goes sort of
the same thing.

01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And Bruce would
look at it and they

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.530 align:middle line:90%
were exploring these things.

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:29.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was just watching.

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to interrupt it.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.020 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of cool.

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, Bruce
reached into his pocket

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and pulled out about a 50
millimeter piezoelectric quartz

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:45.040 align:middle line:90%
sphere.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.485 align:middle line:84%
It looks like glass almost,
but it's actually quartz.

01:01:47.485 --> 01:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
It means that the lattice
going through it is perfect.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't show
it to him at first.

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.750 align:middle line:90%
He says, I have this one.

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
He says, Bruce-- now, Bruce
could have said anything

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
to him.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
He could've said a lot of things
because I knew him very well

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and I knew his understanding
of these things.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But what he said to
him was, he says,

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:13.245 align:middle line:84%
well, this is my
most powerful object.

01:02:13.245 --> 01:02:15.380 align:middle line:90%
But he's hiding it like that.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:22.036 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I really
want you to see this.

01:02:22.036 --> 01:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And he goes like that
and he gives it to him.

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was like
shock on his face.

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Because to him, he thought
it was from nature.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.714 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know that we
had curved it around.

01:02:33.714 --> 01:02:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it
was from nature.

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And just the fact that
would be in nature

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
was just so much to
him, so powerful.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And then he says,
can I touch it?

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's holding this thing and
looking at it and everything.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And Bruce is talking.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to Bruce,
well, how do you use it?

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And Bruce says,
well-- and this is

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.100 align:middle line:84%
where I don't know
why he said this,

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.285 align:middle line:84%
because there could have been
1,000 things he could have

01:02:57.285 --> 01:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
said, but what he
said was, well,

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
if you hold it up
to your third eye,

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.831 align:middle line:90%
whatever you think happens.

01:03:03.831 --> 01:03:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And he says, phew.

01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.380 align:middle line:90%
That's when he really went whoa.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:13.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the ultimate power
object on earth, right?

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.570 align:middle line:90%
He goes whoa.

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.630 align:middle line:90%
And he says, can I try it?

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:17.960 align:middle line:90%
And Bruce says sure.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So he scoots around
and faces out

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.520 align:middle line:90%
towards the public out there.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
walking all around.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Puts it up to his third
eye and closes his eyes.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And few seconds went by and
then you could almost see it.

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
The people-- there was
like a little jerk in time

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
where everybody just kind
of stopped, a lot of people.

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Not all about.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's about
400 people out there,

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
maybe 100 of them stopped,
turned, and looked at him,

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:53.160 align:middle line:90%
and started pointing at him.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.950 align:middle line:90%
All at once.

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And they started walking here.

01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And so over about 15
minutes, pretty soon there's

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
like 100 people and they're
all climbing over these walls

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And now they're at the
bottom, right underneath him,

01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're all talking
and pointing at him.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And he opens his eyes, he
looks down, takes it off,

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
turns around to Bruce, and says,
hey, this thing really works.

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:24.263 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:24.263 --> 01:04:26.570 align:middle line:90%


01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
The experimenter
affects the experiment.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
one last story.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.340 align:middle line:90%


01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:42.240 align:middle line:84%
When I was in about the same
time, maybe a year or so

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
difference, I was in the
Yucatan and I was at Uxmal.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And we were not-- when
you go into Uxmal,

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
there's the pyramid
of the magician.

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.410 align:middle line:90%
It's right in front of you.

01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But off to the left
and a long ways

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:01.220 align:middle line:84%
away is what they call
the Great Pyramid.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was up on
the Great Pyramid

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and on top of the Great
Pyramid is like a house.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a little square building
that you go inside of.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was starting to
go into this building

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and this Japanese man comes out.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.860 align:middle line:84%
He had four women
who were with him.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And this Japanese man came
out, and his Leonardo sphere

01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:25.735 align:middle line:84%
that was around his body
was glowing brightly.

01:05:25.735 --> 01:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen anything
like this in my life.

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was really bright.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And my reaction when I saw
him, I kind of had no choice.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I saw him and he kind
of walked up to me

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and I just bowed to him.

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's got a
sphere going around him

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:47.230 align:middle line:90%
has got to be somebody special.

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:49.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:50.574 align:middle line:90%
I just bowed to him.

01:05:50.574 --> 01:05:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And he bowed to me
and pretty soon we're

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.942 align:middle line:90%
doing this thing back and forth.

01:05:53.942 --> 01:05:55.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we stopped and we
dropped down into a Lotus

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and we sat there
and just looked at--

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and it became clear
almost immediately

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't speak English
and I didn't speak Japanese.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So we just looked at each other
for a long time, about half

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:10.390 align:middle line:90%
an hour, I'd say.

01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually we stood
up, bowed to each other--

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.799 align:middle line:84%
and the women were
taking pictures.

01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll bring that up
later in a moment.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we bowed to each
other and we went on.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And I kept thinking about
him for two or three days

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:27.800 align:middle line:90%
after that and then I forgot.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Time goes on.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And many years later, I am
in Japan for the first time.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I was invited there by
a Buddhist community who

01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
had never allowed
anyone to ever speak

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
at their Buddhist community
that was not Buddhist.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.820 align:middle line:90%
But I am Buddhist as well.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.380 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't know that.

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:55.052 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me, they
said if I would come there,

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:56.760 align:middle line:84%
the only way they
would let me talk there

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
if I came there
with a blank mind

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and did not know even one
word what I was going to say,

01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:05.300 align:middle line:90%
then they would let me talk.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.210 align:middle line:90%
So I gave a workshop there.

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I figured, how easy can it be?

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to plan anything.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.360 align:middle line:90%
You don't write anything out.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
You just go there, you stand
on the stage and start talking.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't know where
you're going to go.

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what I did.

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
It was the first one of
these workshops, by the way.

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:21.760 align:middle line:90%
The Earth, Sky, Heart Workshops.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.180 align:middle line:90%
The first one.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And so while everybody was
coming in to the workshop,

01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
he walks into the workshop,
glowing sphere and all.

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And when he came in,
everybody turned around

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and they all bowed to him.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them,
in unison basically.

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And then he sat down
and I looked at him

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of asked, I went-- I
can't remember if I went to him

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
or he came to me--
but I talked to him

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.257 align:middle line:84%
and I was just saying
good to see you again

01:07:58.257 --> 01:07:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for coming,
but why are you here?

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:06.657 align:middle line:84%
Because anybody
that's on that level,

01:08:06.657 --> 01:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't imagine
why they would want

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.200 align:middle line:90%
to come to one of my workshops.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And I finally said I don't
think you need to do this.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.979 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no,
I want to be here.

01:08:16.979 --> 01:08:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And so by this time,
he could speak--

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.060 align:middle line:84%
this was maybe a
few years later--

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:27.689 align:middle line:90%
he could speak English, sort of.

01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:36.899 align:middle line:84%
And so he stayed and during this
workshop, maybe the third day

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:39.510 align:middle line:84%
or so, there was a young
man in the front who

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:41.100 align:middle line:90%
spoke perfect English.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:45.189 align:middle line:84%
And I took him aside and I
said to him, who is this guy?

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Why is everybody--
and he looked at me

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.330 align:middle line:84%
like, you don't
know who that is?

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.234 align:middle line:90%
And I go, no.

01:08:55.234 --> 01:08:57.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:58.990 align:middle line:90%
He says, we all know who it is.

01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
his name right now.

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:02.686 align:middle line:90%
They've given me everything.

01:09:02.686 --> 01:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I was going to write about
him in one of the books,

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the story
that he gave me,

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:13.899 align:middle line:84%
and I've confirmed this
several times over,

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:21.060 align:middle line:84%
is in Hiroshima when the bomb
went off, he was 15 years old.

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.260 align:middle line:90%
14 or 15 years old.

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.479 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember exactly.

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:27.189 align:middle line:84%
And he was only about six blocks
from where the bomb went off.

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:30.858 align:middle line:84%
And when the explosion was
coming at him very fast,

01:09:30.858 --> 01:09:32.649 align:middle line:84%
he just put his arms
up like this and said,

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:34.724 align:middle line:90%
this will not affect me.

01:09:34.724 --> 01:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And phew, buildings
were blown away

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:38.029 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:41.380 align:middle line:84%
They found him in the
crater sitting cross legged.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.850 align:middle line:90%
No burns, no nothing.

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:43.779 align:middle line:90%
No radiation.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:44.279 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely perfect.

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And he became a symbol
in the 1940s for Japan

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
as how they can
survive what this is.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And the modern day Japanese
don't remember him too much.

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:07.325 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly the older ones
that remember who he was.

01:10:07.325 --> 01:10:09.410 align:middle line:90%
He died recently.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And the four women,
who were young

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
then are now older,
and came and gave me

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
all of the photographs
and his name

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and all the
information, everything.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I still want to write
about him at some point.

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:23.670 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's the same thing.

01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:25.360 align:middle line:90%
This will not affect me.

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Total 100% belief.

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.505 align:middle line:90%
You're walking on water.

01:10:28.505 --> 01:10:32.550 align:middle line:90%
An atomic bomb goes by.

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So if we remember
who we really are,

01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:41.340 align:middle line:84%
there's absolutely
no reason for fear.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.250 align:middle line:90%
This is for sure.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:51.480 align:middle line:90%


01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to get into
the core of all of this.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is why does the
belief patterns not-- what

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
is it about them
that what we believe

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.900 align:middle line:90%
changes the outer reality?

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going
to do this first

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
by talking about-- remember
there was a DVD called

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:19.659 align:middle line:84%
"The Secret" that
went out and they

01:11:19.659 --> 01:11:20.825 align:middle line:90%
were talking about creating.

01:11:20.825 --> 01:11:23.460 align:middle line:90%


01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And we brought this
up once before,

01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to bring
up again right now to go

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.545 align:middle line:90%
into a little more deeply.

01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:31.810 align:middle line:90%


01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
The reason that works,
that, yes, there

01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:40.920 align:middle line:84%
is the law of attraction that
pulls to you what you are

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.900 align:middle line:84%
thinking and feeling
and acting, everything

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.900 align:middle line:90%
you're emitting off of you.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But on another level, there
is a very specific procedure

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.585 align:middle line:90%
of how to create.

01:11:54.585 --> 01:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But this procedure works
only with the brain.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And like we said, the
brain is polarized.

01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And so if you do
use this procedure--

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm only talking
about this right

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
now just to get it clear how
the brain works on creation,

01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:13.510 align:middle line:90%
but I don't want you to use it.

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a
better way and less

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
harmful way, far
more powerful way,

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
using the heart
rather than the brain.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's not polarized.

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, if you
do create with the brain,

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
you get exactly
what your intention

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
is, if you do it the way
we're going to put on here.

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But you will get an
equal and opposite force.

01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:40.610 align:middle line:90%
It's literally science.

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It's an equal and
opposite force will

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
come to you from behind
in the opposite direction.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.250 align:middle line:90%
You won't see it coming.

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I will just appear in your
life and you'll go, oh my god.

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's for sure is going to
be something you don't want.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.770 align:middle line:90%


01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:57.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's just the way it is.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the nature of what
this way of creating does.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And I need to refer back
to this one again later.

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So I got to keep
it on a-- so I'm

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about exactly how
this creation process works.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And let me see where
I am at on this.

01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:40.204 align:middle line:90%


01:13:40.204 --> 01:13:41.560 align:middle line:90%
I was out of sequence.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.035 align:middle line:90%
But it is life.

01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:47.100 align:middle line:90%


01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Gregg
Braden wrote a book

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:53.110 align:middle line:90%
called "The Isaiah Effect."

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Anybody read that book?

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the same information
that was in "The Secret."

01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And it came out earlier
than "The Secret."

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And even earlier than that
was where it came from,

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
was when they found
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:08.910 align:middle line:84%
they found another
pot near there.

01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And so Gregg was just
talking about what

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:16.326 align:middle line:84%
came out of this Dead Sea
scroll that was BC sometime.

01:14:16.326 --> 01:14:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know
exactly when it was,

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.360 align:middle line:90%
but it was a long time ago.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.430 align:middle line:90%
So this is nothing.

01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:23.660 align:middle line:84%
What's in the "The
Secret" is nothing new.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It's very old.

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:29.110 align:middle line:90%


01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be
creation from the brain.

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:38.440 align:middle line:90%


01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And the brain, the way it starts
out is it's a thinking process.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I thinks.

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:46.767 align:middle line:90%
That's what it does.

01:14:46.767 --> 01:14:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It thinks and thinks and
thinks and does thinking.

01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And all the creation from the
brain begins with thoughts.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is the source of
where the creation begins.

01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:09.009 align:middle line:84%
And these thoughts
are based on logic.

01:15:09.009 --> 01:15:14.170 align:middle line:90%


01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you
create from this process

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to come to
you in a logical way.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to see anything
just go proof out of nothing.

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:27.533 align:middle line:84%
You can do that with the heart,
but you can't do it with this.

01:15:27.533 --> 01:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
"The "The Secret" is
primarily focused on money,

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:32.050 align:middle line:90%
it seemed to me.

01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
going to make money,

01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see one
of your stocks go way up

01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:37.523 align:middle line:90%
or something is going to happen.

01:15:37.523 --> 01:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to see the
process of how it got to you.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a logical way, always
a logical way how it came in.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:54.958 align:middle line:84%
And then under this, the brain
uses attention to be get it.

01:15:54.958 --> 01:16:00.400 align:middle line:90%


01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it's
trying to create,

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:08.780 align:middle line:84%
it focuses its attention
on a very specific area.

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's trying to
make rain, for example.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe trying to heal
something in the body.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same thing.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't make any
difference what the subject is

01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:21.650 align:middle line:90%
that it's focusing on.

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But rain is one that
is kind of good enough

01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:27.300 align:middle line:90%
for certain reasons.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.250 align:middle line:90%
It's easier to see.

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And so then it has
to put intention--

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
it focuses attention on
rain and the intention

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
is that it could be more
rain or less, right?

01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:49.060 align:middle line:84%
The intention is to say it's
dry and you want more rain,

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.715 align:middle line:84%
so your intention is that it
actually rain and it solves

01:16:52.715 --> 01:16:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the dry problem
and this is where

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:56.080 align:middle line:90%
your intention is coming from.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And people do this all the
time when they're praying.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.034 align:middle line:84%
They go into it and
they pray and say

01:17:04.034 --> 01:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
you have given this
intention I want something

01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:07.481 align:middle line:90%
to happen in my life.

01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, there's
a million different ways

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.710 align:middle line:90%
you can go.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:12.180 align:middle line:90%
But they're using intention.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:14.600 align:middle line:84%
They're intending
something to happen.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.090 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't usually work.

01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
But under intention is
where "The Secret" falls in.

01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:24.577 align:middle line:84%
Other than the
laws of attraction,

01:17:24.577 --> 01:17:26.160 align:middle line:84%
there are these three
components which

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.285 align:middle line:90%
we've talked about before.

01:17:27.285 --> 01:17:52.590 align:middle line:90%


01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Mental body, emotional
body, and physical body.

01:17:56.430 --> 01:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And all three of
these components

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:05.470 align:middle line:84%
must be functioning fully
in order for this intention

01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:06.230 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:09.440 align:middle line:84%
If you leave one of them
off, nothing happens.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're wanting
rain, your mental body

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
has to see rain
coming from the sky,

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
seeing clouds, seeing dark,
seeing the temperature.

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Seeing.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.123 align:middle line:90%
It's all a seeing process.

01:18:23.123 --> 01:18:24.380 align:middle line:90%
It's visual.

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And so it sees all
that stuff happening.

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
If it's a disease in
the body, then you

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.999 align:middle line:90%
would see it completely gone.

01:18:32.999 --> 01:18:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Or if you can see that,
say, it's a skin disease,

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and you can see it, you would
see your skin normal again

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.270 align:middle line:90%
and all those kinds of things.

01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And that process has to
be going on while you're

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.740 align:middle line:90%
doing these other two things.

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you just had rain--
if you've been in a drought,

01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:52.910 align:middle line:84%
say, for nine years
and everything's dying

01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly it
starts raining, you're

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:56.040 align:middle line:84%
going to have an
emotional response.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.600 align:middle line:90%


01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Or if you've just had cancer
and you've almost died

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and all of sudden
it's gone, you're

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.540 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
emotional response

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.250 align:middle line:90%
to these kinds of things.

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have the
exact same emotional response

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:15.700 align:middle line:84%
as if it actually happened, even
though it hasn't happened yet.

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So you have to see it happening,
you have to feel it happening,

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and you actually have to--
it goes to that 100% thing.

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
If you are 100%, then
you would actually

01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
be crying, because you
know it's going to happen.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But the one that everybody
leaves off usually

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:34.550 align:middle line:90%
is the physical body.

01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:37.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do this
and a lot of people do that

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even
think about this.

01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's Gregg Braden went to
Tibet to study with the Lamas

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.040 align:middle line:90%
there about that.

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
ones that told them

01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
how important this
one was if you're

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.600 align:middle line:90%
going to do this kind of thing.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And on the physical
body, if it's raining,

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:58.490 align:middle line:84%
you actually have to feel rain
on your skin, smell the ozone,

01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%
feel the temperature drop.

01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the same sensations
you would have it suddenly

01:20:04.450 --> 01:20:06.170 align:middle line:90%
started raining right now.

01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
You would have to be doing
that, feeling that, emotionally

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
having that response and
seeing it all happen.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.580 align:middle line:84%
If you do all three
at once, it's science.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
It will happen
every single time.

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.595 align:middle line:84%
It isn't a matter of
what anybody else thinks

01:20:21.595 --> 01:20:22.720 align:middle line:90%
or anything else like that.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.320 align:middle line:84%
It's going to happen
every single time.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately it would be
nice if that was that easy.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately
because the brain

01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%
is divided into two,
male and female,

01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:38.317 align:middle line:84%
you get this part of your
intention that you don't want.

01:20:38.317 --> 01:20:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But you need to
understand that that's

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:44.190 align:middle line:90%
how the brain does its thing.

01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:52.854 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to skip
now to another subject.

01:20:52.854 --> 01:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But we'll come back to this
one because tomorrow I'm

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.870 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about the heart.

01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I don't think the
creation process of the heart

01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't happen until
the fifth day, I think.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure of that.

01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:10.770 align:middle line:90%


01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm going to
flip this back over here.

01:21:14.690 --> 01:21:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And in the brain, there is
something that we all have,

01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:26.310 align:middle line:90%
but it is not functioning.

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
the merkaba, where

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.250 align:middle line:84%
all the electromagnetic
fields are just sitting

01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:33.460 align:middle line:90%
there stationary, not moving.

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But with intention,
you can do things.

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You can get them spinning,
breathing certain ways,

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and it pops out and the
thing becomes alive.

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's another
component to the merkaba.

01:21:46.290 --> 01:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It is more important
than the merkaba itself.

01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And the merkaba
itself won't really

01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:55.870 align:middle line:84%
function anywhere
near its potential

01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
until this other
component is connected

01:21:58.070 --> 01:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to it, which we never talked
about in the first three books,

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.907 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

01:22:04.907 --> 01:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Definitely not in
the first two books.

01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I talked about
it in Living in the Heart.

01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I never read the
book, so I don't know.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I want to give
credit where credit is due.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:21.780 align:middle line:84%
This came from the Mayans
and also from the Kahunas

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:24.810 align:middle line:90%
in Hawaii.

01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I got this from the Mayans
and it's extremely detailed,

01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:33.280 align:middle line:90%
as you're going to see.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that this was
something that only they knew.

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And then later I had two
older Kahuna teachers.

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And when I just
mentioned it to them,

01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
they say, oh yeah,
we know about it.

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they
described it in detail

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.470 align:middle line:90%
exactly like the Mayans knew it.

01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
probably other tribes

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:54.940 align:middle line:90%
that understand this, too.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%


01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.870 align:middle line:84%
There are these little entry
ways that come out of the head.

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:05.830 align:middle line:90%
There's 10 of them, actually.

01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:07.790 align:middle line:90%
We're only going to use eight.

01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And they activate this--
at least the Kahunas do.

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not positive
about the Mayans,

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
but the Kahunas told
me, both of them did,

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
told me that it's
very, very secret.

01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And they do it to their children
when they reach puberty.

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:28.530 align:middle line:90%
They activate it for them.

01:23:28.530 --> 01:23:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when it's
completely done,

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
there's a thing
about the human head

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that we normally
don't know is there.

01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I call them the beams of light.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to describe
them to you, how they work,

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:47.700 align:middle line:90%
exactly how in great detail.

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get a
chance, you're going to do it.

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
actually do this.

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:56.894 align:middle line:84%
And roughly half of you
will be able to do it now

01:23:56.894 --> 01:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and the other half
will be able to do it

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%
in probably the next two
or three weeks or so.

01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:03.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard to do.

01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:06.150 align:middle line:84%
One thing about
the pineal gland,

01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the source of
what we're about to do,

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:13.660 align:middle line:84%
it responds to intention better
than anything in the body.

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:16.280 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So because of that, it
makes it rather easy.

01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
When you put an intention out,
it happens just instantly.

01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:27.930 align:middle line:90%
So drawing of a head.

01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And actually, let me start with
this and we'll come back to it.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:38.160 align:middle line:90%
This is a person.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And these beams, say,
the ones that come out

01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:41.870 align:middle line:90%
of the side of the head.

01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:43.578 align:middle line:84%
There are ones that
come right over here.

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not the temples.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Describe exactly
where these spots are.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It's back by the ears
and slightly higher.

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the spot that
enters in directly

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.935 align:middle line:84%
to the-- if you were
to go straight through,

01:24:53.935 --> 01:24:57.820 align:middle line:84%
you'd hit the pineal chakra--
not the gland, but the chakra.

01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:00.420 align:middle line:84%
All of this is coming
from the chakra.

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:02.890 align:middle line:84%
The gland is just a
little bit farther away,

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:05.720 align:middle line:84%
but it's the chakra that's
doing it, not the gland.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So these beams that
come out of the head

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:middle line:84%
are one hand link long
basically, but some of them

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.530 align:middle line:90%
are shorter.

01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:18.140 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see why.

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they conform to the
shape of the head and they

01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:24.870 align:middle line:90%
fit inside of a perfect sphere.

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:26.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just a perfect sphere.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And so because our
head is not spherical,

01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:34.050 align:middle line:84%
they have slightly
different lengths.

01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But they're about
a hand-length long.

01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And they look like
they're exactly the same

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.110 align:middle line:90%
as your breathing tube.

01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:41.552 align:middle line:90%
They're like a fluorescent tube.

01:25:41.552 --> 01:25:42.260 align:middle line:90%
They're straight.

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.330 align:middle line:90%
They're perfectly straight.

01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you take your middle
finger and your thumb

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and put it together, that
is the size of your beams.

01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
size of your hands.

01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but if
you put it around something,

01:26:02.150 --> 01:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
just a little tiny
bit of pressure

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
to push these things out,
that's where you would come

01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:09.700 align:middle line:90%
to the actual size of them.

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.440 align:middle line:90%
So they're that big around.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And from here, underneath
here, this place

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:17.750 align:middle line:84%
where it folds, from there
to the tip of the finger

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:20.036 align:middle line:90%
is the longest one.

01:26:20.036 --> 01:26:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's some that
are little bit shorter.

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.760 align:middle line:90%


01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But they don't look that
way coming off the body.

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:31.340 align:middle line:84%
They haven't been used
for thousands of years.

01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're just fuzzy little
things that kind of look

01:26:34.810 --> 01:26:36.290 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And this one might
come up like that.

01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one coming
out the crown chakra over here.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
They just kind of look like
little-- they look like fog.

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually kind
of a gold-ish color.

01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're a dowser
or you see aura,

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.810 align:middle line:84%
you probably have
never seen these.

01:26:58.810 --> 01:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to
know-- like in dowsing.

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Who are dowsers here?

01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:06.735 align:middle line:90%
How many dowsers?

01:27:06.735 --> 01:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
We got one, two,
three, four, five.

01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
In dowsing-- not with pendulums,
but if you're using sticks--

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.520 align:middle line:84%
most people think that
dowsing's just for water.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.310 align:middle line:90%
But you can find anything.

01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter what it is.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking for water,
then you're going to hit water.

01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So you better think good,
clean drinking water

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to hit
the sewer lines, too.

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's what you're
thinking will

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:37.470 align:middle line:90%
determine how these rods work.

01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But you can also turn it to
gold and you could feel gold.

01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And now those same
rods that found water

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.530 align:middle line:90%
will find only gold.

01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:47.491 align:middle line:90%
Or anything else on earth.

01:27:47.491 --> 01:27:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you think about.

01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
know that something

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.410 align:middle line:90%
exists before you can see it.

01:27:56.410 --> 01:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
This is an interesting
part of our relationship

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:02.900 align:middle line:90%
with the external reality.

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.050 align:middle line:90%
What's his name?

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Magellan.

01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:05.461 align:middle line:90%
>>Magellan.

01:28:05.461 --> 01:28:05.960 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Magellan.

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:06.990 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Magellan came here, I
think it was seven ships.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was the west
coast of South America.

01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:19.305 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled into a bay
with these giant ships.

01:28:19.305 --> 01:28:22.450 align:middle line:90%


01:28:22.450 --> 01:28:24.840 align:middle line:84%
This is all written
down in his journals.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And he then got in a boat, a few
of them, and they rowed ashore.

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were met by quite a
few indigenous people there.

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how they
were communicating exactly.

01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But basically they
said to Magellan

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:46.420 align:middle line:84%
looking at these little boats,
well, how did you get here?

01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were
looking at the boats.

01:28:47.970 --> 01:28:48.761 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh no.

01:28:48.761 --> 01:28:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Not those.

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.110 align:middle line:84%
The big ships are
sitting out there.

01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:52.800 align:middle line:90%
We came in on those.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.010 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't see them.

01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Only one person out of about
200 people that were there

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.950 align:middle line:90%
could see his boats.

01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.160 align:middle line:84%
When all the other people
looked at the boats,

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.590 align:middle line:84%
they saw right through
them, because those boats

01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
were beyond their imagination
and they couldn't see them.

01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And the only person that
could see them was a shaman

01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and he was used to doing
very unusual things.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And so he was able to see
the boats, but they couldn't.

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is the nature
of our consciousness.

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:28.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the same way with UFOs.

01:29:28.210 --> 01:29:31.040 align:middle line:84%
You can be sitting on a hill--
and this has happened with me

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.900 align:middle line:84%
before-- where I remember
one time I was sitting there,

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.930 align:middle line:84%
there was a UFO
like 30 feet away.

01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:39.110 align:middle line:90%
It's big, sitting right there.

01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going ah!

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And the other people were going,
what are you talking about?

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.520 align:middle line:90%
They can't see it.

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.650 align:middle line:90%
It was too real.

01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:49.540 align:middle line:90%
It was too close.

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
If it was a little speck in the
sky, maybe they could see that.

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Specks are pretty easy.

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Little lights moving around.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I can see those.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:59.110 align:middle line:90%


01:29:59.110 --> 01:30:03.170 align:middle line:84%
But when it's right
there in your face,

01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:05.130 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy to just
look right through it

01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:07.360 align:middle line:90%
and not see it.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And so these things, I
would have to teach you,

01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:12.977 align:middle line:84%
even if you were-- if you
haven't seen them before.

01:30:12.977 --> 01:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Once you know how to
see them, they're easy.

01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:17.200 align:middle line:90%
They're brighter than the auras.

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
But you have to tune your inner
vision to them to see them.

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And then once you do, they pop
right out and you can see them.

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So there are eight-- there
are 10 different places where

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:31.620 align:middle line:84%
these exits are
that they come out.

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
But this is-- a guy who's
walking down the street-- this

01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.140 align:middle line:90%
is kind of what they look like.

01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's not-- it isn't what
they actually look like once

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:47.700 align:middle line:90%
they're activated.

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.260 align:middle line:84%
You can turn them from that
into these straight beams.

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:53.400 align:middle line:90%


01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:56.055 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to give you
what the person looks like.

01:30:56.055 --> 01:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to draw this as
though the person's looking

01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.920 align:middle line:90%
this way.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.086 align:middle line:90%
And there's a reason for it.

01:31:00.086 --> 01:31:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I'll explain this in a moment.

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully.

01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Here we'll try it again.

01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:07.339 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this one's
going to be worse.

01:31:07.339 --> 01:31:07.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:11.880 align:middle line:90%


01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well.

01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:14.020 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is.

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.800 align:middle line:90%
I can't do any better right now.

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.680 align:middle line:90%
He's got blue eyes.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.615 align:middle line:84%
This is going to represent
the thickness of the skull.

01:31:25.615 --> 01:31:30.200 align:middle line:90%


01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
represent the pineal chakra.

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:38.100 align:middle line:90%


01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing it in red,
but a little black line,

01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:44.850 align:middle line:84%
because most people when
they psychically see it,

01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:46.580 align:middle line:84%
they see it either
as red or black.

01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:54.630 align:middle line:90%


01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's one beam that
comes straight out of the crown

01:31:59.440 --> 01:31:59.940 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's a straight beam and it
looks like it's been cut off.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.400 align:middle line:90%


01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.942 align:middle line:84%
It is exactly the same
size as the breathing tube

01:32:08.942 --> 01:32:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's inside
the breathing tube,

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.160 align:middle line:84%
so it's hard to distinguish
those psychically when

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.560 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at them.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But is not cut off straight
because it fits into a sphere.

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:21.440 align:middle line:90%
So there's a slight curve.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And then there is another
one that comes out here,

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:28.190 align:middle line:90%
out the third eye.

01:32:28.190 --> 01:32:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And another one that comes
out the back of the third eye.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Another one that comes
down inside the throat.

01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
one that comes up here

01:32:38.890 --> 01:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
which we call either
the unicorn or the 45.

01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:45.185 align:middle line:84%
And it comes out the
back kind of like this.

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:48.530 align:middle line:90%


01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there's one
coming out the side

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.070 align:middle line:84%
on both sides-- one
coming out this way,

01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:54.670 align:middle line:90%
and one coming out this way.

01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:58.236 align:middle line:84%
So you have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

01:32:58.236 --> 01:32:59.940 align:middle line:90%
eight of these coming out.

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.980 align:middle line:84%
There's another slot
right here at the chin

01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and going out this way
and that's for somebody

01:33:04.930 --> 01:33:07.050 align:middle line:90%
else, not for you.

01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll explain what it is.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.660 align:middle line:84%
But I think I'm
running out of time.

01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I got two minutes.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.540 align:middle line:90%


01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I can
do it in two minutes.

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But this has to do with
a certain kind of person.

01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:26.950 align:middle line:90%
We think of ascending.

01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
We think of going
up in consciousness.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you get all the
way to the top, guess what?

01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:34.160 align:middle line:90%
You come back down.

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's about half
of life ascending

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's about half
of life descending.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And when they
descend, you can tell

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.350 align:middle line:84%
by looking at them
because they'll have-- ah.

01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:46.202 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:33:46.202 --> 01:33:49.450 align:middle line:90%


01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I would return this.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:33:53.550 --> 01:34:08.448 align:middle line:90%
