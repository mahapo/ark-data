00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>This is now Day Two.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.930 align:middle line:84%
This the day of the
body and healing.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.131 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, good morning, everybody.

00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the second
day, which is the day

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.640 align:middle line:84%
of the body, and healing,
and how to keep balance

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.680 align:middle line:90%
in your life and in your body.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're focusing on
physical stuff all day today.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.750 align:middle line:84%
I hope you wore casual
clothes this morning--

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:84%
simple, because we're
going to be doing work

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:84%
on the ground and
everything else.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going
to start right in.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
But the first
thing I want to ask

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
is, how many people
here are healers?

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know
everybody's a healer.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you cut
yourself, who fixes it?

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:90%
We are all healers.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But who's doing
this professionally?

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.695 align:middle line:84%
I just want to count that
number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:90%
8-- 38 people, OK.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.916 align:middle line:84%
Because when we get down
into the little beds

00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that we form for
the healing, I'd

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
like those 38 people to
kind of be evenly dispersed

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:84%
across there, so
everybody has somebody

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
that's used to doing healing--
understands that kind of thing.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about my
experience with healing.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're welcome to
put your experience

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:84%
in at any time, if you feel
it needs to be added to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:90%
or taken away from.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I totally believe in negative
and positive understandings

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
of things, so we can
find what the truth is.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
go for what has taken me

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:90%
my entire life to understand.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.805 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these things are
going to be, for some of you,

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
you'll go, oh,
yeah, I know this.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And for other ones, it'll
be stuff you probably never

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
heard before, and
you're going to kind

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:90%
of twist your mind a bit.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing is that
nothing happens in the body

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
without other
components affecting it.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
anything happens

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
physically in your body, it
isn't just a physical thing.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:90%
We have four parts to us.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And let me just write this out.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.145 align:middle line:90%
I put it into a tetrahedron.

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:31.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:90%
So I'll put it like this.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is a tetrahedron
sitting on a table.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is spirit
up at the top.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we can just put
this is the mental body.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.904 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I know you're a long
ways away, but that

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:07.665 align:middle line:84%
says "mental body," emotional
body, and physical body.

00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And so our spirit, or some
people call it a soul,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and our mental body, emotional
body, and physical body

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
are linked together, from how I
see it, in a tetrahedral form.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And if anything
happens on any of them,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
there's always these
other components

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:90%
that are connected to it.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Can't talk about one
of them without talking

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:90%
about the other.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about the physical body,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
there is always these
other three aspects

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:90%
that are deeply affecting this.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And on Earth today,
the biggest one

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
is the emotional body, at
least that's what I've found.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:84%
The emotional
trauma that we have

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.460 align:middle line:84%
is one of the primary
causes of disease.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And so if you use
allopathic medicine, which

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%
doesn't recognize this,
and you have a disease,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and you take medicine
to cure that disease,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
or to get rid of the
symptoms, if you haven't dealt

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.417 align:middle line:84%
with the other aspects--
especially the emotional one--

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
it's just going to come
back some other way.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:90%
You haven't cured the problem.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
You've only just worked
with the symptoms.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And so you get rid of
cancer, and it comes back

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
as something else, because
you haven't gone enough.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
This is so basic
to me that I want

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
to see if anybody has a
different idea about this,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:90%
or feels differently.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Is there anyone that
feels differently?

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's good.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
people don't get this.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But this is a basic point
that I had to bring forth.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect that to
me is essential-- now,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of healers don't
think this is essential,

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
but I'm giving you my
opinions-- and that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
is that you have to have
permission to do healing.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Even if you were this amazing
person that could just

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:84%
wave their hand,
if I came in here

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and just waved my
hand over all of you

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to heal everything
you had, I would

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:84%
be doing more harm to almost
all of you than you can imagine.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.195 align:middle line:84%
And there would be a
lot higher selves that

00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:90%
would be really angry at me.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we create things within
ourselves for more than just--

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
we have reasons
why we do things.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
healing produces responses

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:90%
that we need to deal with.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
We have something that
we're trying to deal with,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:90%
very often from a past lifetime.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have to know, if
that illness is there,

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:84%
if the person has worked
through what that is about

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:90%
or if they have not.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when I asked my person--
and it took me a long time

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.906 align:middle line:84%
to understand this,
too-- I not only

00:06:21.906 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
ask the person for permission,
because they almost always

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:90%
will say yes.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
what's good for them.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
that I've found

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is crucial to me is
to ask a higher level.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And you could go to
your own higher self.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But I found that it's better
if I go to their higher self.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
their higher self

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and ask if it's appropriate
for you to do this,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:84%
they'll either tell
you no, and go away.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Leave them alone.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll give you yes.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:90%
The body knows what is wrong.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And you can ask the body.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking in
those levels to the body,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:84%
most people can only
ask yes or no questions.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're advanced enough,
you can go in and actually

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
talk to the body and have
a discussion with it.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It'll tell you more than
just yes or no questions.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to
the higher self,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
the higher self
has a viewpoint far

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
expanded over what the body
sees, and is able to tell you,

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:84%
if you wish, exactly why you
either do something or do

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:90%
not something.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can even ask
it-- and this took me

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
about eight or nine
years to understand,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and it was by
accident one time--

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
it felt like accident--
in fact, I'll

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:84%
even tell that story
in a little bit.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And I asked permission
from the higher self

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:90%
to do a healing on someone.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:90%
And the higher self said yes.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to say thank
you and move away from that.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And it says, just a minute,
and says, you can ask me more.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you
exactly what to do.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
This becomes really
interesting, because a lot

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of times what they
tell you to do

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:84%
is not in anything that you've
ever probably heard before.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Because they know.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:90%
They're surgical.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly what to
do to solve the problem.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And very often, it falls outside
of what we normally think

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:90%
is healing.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll give that example
in just a moment.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And so permission is important.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:84%
And the means of asking
how to get to higher self

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
is-- this falls into the
same kind of category

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.659 align:middle line:84%
where, for you guys
about the Merkaba,

00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
it took a long time to
understand that there were

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
these shapes around you
that you can't see, or feel,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And the higher self
is just another level

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
of the same kind of ability
that we have to communicate.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And it is something that
you'd have to do through--

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know--
let me just put it,

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.645 align:middle line:84%
how many people actually do know
how to talk to someone's higher

00:09:19.645 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:90%
self?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.966 align:middle line:84%
So 1, 2, 3, 4 5 6, 7 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:09:28.966 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:90%
18-- that's 18 people in here.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And those 18 people have
an incredible advantage

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:90%
over other healers.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.532 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll tell
the story right now.

00:09:40.532 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Which one was it?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, this one.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:48.764 align:middle line:84%
I was in Taos, New
Mexico, long time ago.

00:09:48.764 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember when.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
It was probably in the
'90s, early '90s, I think.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, it was in the '80s.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:84%
This is when I was
really beginning.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
This is maybe '86 or
'87-- somewhere in there.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:90%
I remember now.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was a friend of mine.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't
boyfriend/girlfriend.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:90%
She was a friend.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:90%
But we were very close.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And she just got sick one day.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And she just kept getting
sicker, and sicker, and sicker.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:90%
And then she's in the hospital.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And they thought she
may die from this.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
what it was she had.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I went in, to help
her because I loved her

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to help her.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was in
there, I asked her

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
if I could have
permission to try to help.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:90%
And she said yes.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to
her higher self.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And her higher self--
he said, yes, yes,

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that she had completed
everything on this,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and that it was fine
for this to go away now.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:90%
So I said OK.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
to back away from him.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And the higher self
says, just a minute.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you can ask
me exactly what to do.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had never
thought of that before.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, what do I do?

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And so he told me something
that I would never come up with.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
He gave me an image
of a teddy bear,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
a little brown teddy
bear about that big.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:90%
And he says, you see it?

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:31.601 align:middle line:90%
I say, yeah.

00:11:31.601 --> 00:11:33.975 align:middle line:84%
He says, you've got to get
one that looks just like this.

00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, and a
single rose on a single stem

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:90%
and a little rose.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
The stem was about that long,
and the rose about this big.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was a bud that was
just starting to open.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And then he says-- I
can't remember the order.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:90%
There was an order.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I had to hand her the teddy
bear or the rose first, and then

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.370 align:middle line:90%
the next one.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to
say a sentence.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And the sentence
was very precise.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And he made me say it.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.724 align:middle line:84%
He made me say it
a couple times.

00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:90%
He says it's got to be perfect.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, so I got
the sentence down.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
sentence, either, anymore.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I went and collected
up these items best I could.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And I came back.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:90%
And she was asleep at the time.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And the nurse came in, and
I waited until she woke up.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The nurse did some things for a
little bit, and then she left.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:90%
And then I went over.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:90%
And I waited a few minutes.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I talked to her
for a little while,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:90%
because she was just waking up.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Then when she was
really kind of awake,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, I got a gift for you.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:90%
She says, oh, goodie.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was-- I think I
gave her the teddy bear first.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And says, oh, thank you.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:90%
And I gave her the rose.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:90%
She says, oh, thanks.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.755 align:middle line:84%
And then I immediately
just said this sentence.

00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And she just looked
at me like that.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I slapped
her across the face.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And she just started
going crazy, kind of.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:90%
And then she started crying.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And she started crying, and
crying, and crying, and crying.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.335 align:middle line:90%
And I left her an hour later.

00:13:05.335 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And she was still crying.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And the next day,
everything went away.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It was just completely gone.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.585 align:middle line:84%
And it was something her
dad did-- gave her this gift

00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:90%
and did and said something.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think she
ever saw him again.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And the emotional
impact of that was now

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:84%
making her sick,
many years later.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And so the human body is not
as straightforward as it looks.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Diseases are not what
we think they are.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:90%
They're much more complex.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Even accidents-- there
are no accidents.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.792 align:middle line:84%
We're creating
everything all the time.

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
You've gotta come from
that point of view

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:90%
to understand life.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
We're creating every single
thing that happens to us.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just beginning to
give to you what I've learned.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:90%
And hopefully, it will help.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
There's another
huge area in healing

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:90%
that is very often overlooked.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with the person,

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and the healer-- both of
you-- what you believe

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.210 align:middle line:90%
is true, whatever that is.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It's like a cage you're in.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It's walls, and you can't
get beyond those beliefs.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And so you're limited by them.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And so is the person
that you're dealing with.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And so if they have
belief patterns that

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
are different than
yours, it does

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:84%
help if you kind of know
a little bit about them

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
they believe is true.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But these belief
patterns are huge.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
We can go back into
the stories of Jesus.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.289 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time when
he was walking on water.

00:15:11.289 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:90%
We all remember this one.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.038 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
boats out in the water

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:90%
with the disciples in them.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And he's kind of
standing there in water.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And they're looking at them.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you see somebody
breaking your belief patterns,

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.157 align:middle line:84%
it has a really
big effect on you.

00:15:31.157 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, somebody flies around
this room, you're going to go,

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:90%
well, I want to do that.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:42.392 align:middle line:84%
And so it was Peter
who it impacted.

00:15:42.392 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It could have
impacted all of them.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.266 align:middle line:84%
They all could
have ran out there.

00:15:45.266 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But it only impacted
one to the level

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:90%
that they could actually do it.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.596 align:middle line:84%
And so Peter gets out, and
says, I can do that, too.

00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And he walks over, and stands
next to Jesus on the water.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:90%
But something happened in Peter.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:84%
One cell somewhere in
his body-- who knows,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
it could have been on his big
toe, or his finger somewhere.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
One little cell says,
"Walking on water?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.695 align:middle line:90%
Peter, are you crazy?

00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:90%
[BLOOP]

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:84%
He immediately fell into the
water, because he had a doubt.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is what belief
patterns are about.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:90%
It's 100% one way or the other.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing in the middle.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:84%
You either can believe
it, or you don't.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And if even a tiny, tiny,
tiny, tiny little piece of you

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
doesn't believe it,
you don't believe it.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:90%
It's all the way or nothing.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
we're all faced

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
with as we try to
get into higher

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, because we've got
all these things around us that

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
are stopping us, because we
don't believe all this stuff.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And we have to get
through it somehow.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:90%
And this is it's not easy.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a human dilemma.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, Master Zhou.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to write
an address down here.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about somebody,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and the things I'm going to
say are pretty hard to believe.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't believe
it, go talk to him.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:90%
He'll show you.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:84%
He'll actually show you
what I'm talking about.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And he loves to show you.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:90%
He is Master Zhou, is his name.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
He's a Chinese-American.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
He lives in Los Angeles--
a little tiny guy.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:90%
And he's in his 80s, I think.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
He acts like he doesn't speak
English, but he does perfectly.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
He uses a translators
when he's in the room-- I

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:90%
think to be dramatic.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:90%
But he's a really pure person.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's eleventh
generation Qigong Master.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.260 align:middle line:90%
And this guy is truly a Master.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:84%
He really knows
what this is about.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to put his name
and address and phone number

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
on here, because he has
helped a lot of people

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
get through their
belief patterns,

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:90%
better than most people can.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:90%
This is his name.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's Zhou, but his name
is Joe, just like Joseph.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And the address
where he is is 2001

00:18:43.900 --> 00:19:09.137 align:middle line:84%
South Barrington Avenue,
for the filming crew,

00:19:09.137 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:90%
this is rather convenient.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:90%
He's in West LA.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:23.558 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:10%
And you'll understand
in a minute

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.725 align:middle line:10%
why I'm spending so much time
writing down this address.

00:19:27.725 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Master Zhou came to Sedona.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
He was actually
here just recently,

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:84%
but he was here 10
years ago or more.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure when.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And he had a little ad in a
newspaper asking for people

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:90%
if they wanted to watch.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And my wife, Claudette,
happened to see it.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And she's just instantaneously
yes, this person,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:90%
no, not this person.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:90%
She saw him.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
She says, oh, I
want to go see him.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And she asked me if I wanted to.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:90%
And I go, oh, I don't think so.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And so she came to
wherever it was.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was about
this many people there.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing he did
was he brought two chairs out.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't
have arms on them.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
They were just flat,
one chair like this.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it
was already there.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And then he had another
chair about that far away,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:90%
facing each other.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And then he brought out a
piece of paper-- rice paper.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But it was stretched on a
little, thin, black frame.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And the paper was
about this big,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.516 align:middle line:84%
and stretched tightly so
you could see it was tight.

00:20:46.516 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And he passed it around
the room so everybody

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.056 align:middle line:84%
could see it's a piece
of paper, and not

00:20:50.056 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
really steel or
something like that.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.760 align:middle line:84%
They could see it was just
a light piece of paper.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:90%
And then the last person came.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And he had them place
it across the chair,

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.726 align:middle line:84%
so it was on both chairs,
and just suspended on them.

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Then Master Zhou
stood up in the chair,

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:90%
and stood over on the paper.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.454 align:middle line:84%
He's now standing
on a piece of paper.

00:21:08.454 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:84%
There's about that
much difference

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
between standing on paper
and standing on water--

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.150 align:middle line:90%
that much-- nothing.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he
began his lecture.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:90%
So he's standing on the paper.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing he
does, he has somebody pass

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:90%
around a bowl of water.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It was a Pyrex bowl, so
you could see through it.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted
everybody to touch it

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.032 align:middle line:84%
so they could see that
it was room temperature.

00:21:36.032 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
The next thing they did is
they brought it and put it

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.134 align:middle line:90%
into his hands.

00:21:39.134 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Somebody from the audience
put it in his hand.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at it.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.752 align:middle line:84%
And in about two seconds,
he boils the water.

00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:90%
The water's actually boiling.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
He put it down,
and boiling water.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing he did
would probably break almost

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:90%
everybody's belief patterns.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Because this is off the scale.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
This is even more than
things that Jesus was doing.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
He took some baby clothes, about
two years old-- little, tiny,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:90%
baby clothes.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And right before their
eyes, he shrank his body

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
into a little, tiny person,
and put on these baby clothes.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.707 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.707 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:84%
That's why I put his
address up there,

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.581 align:middle line:90%
because you'd never believe me.

00:22:19.581 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave his lecture
on healing and Qigong.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards, in
this little, tiny body

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:84%
with his little, tiny clothes,
standing on a piece of paper.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.836 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards,
when they were leaving--

00:22:39.836 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Claudette was
starting to leave--

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and he says to Claudette,
you, come here.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.990 align:middle line:84%
He says, you can
do all this stuff.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:84%
He says, I could
show you right now.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:90%
You're just that far away.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, no, that's OK.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.810 align:middle line:90%
And she starts to walk away.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:90%
And he says, no, no, come here.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
He says, you're so close.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:90%
He says, let me just show you.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, oh, OK.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.744 align:middle line:90%
And so he lays her down.

00:23:09.744 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
He goes into another room and
he lays her down on a thing.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And he puts wet towels
that had been wrung out,

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:90%
but they were wet.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And he took about that many of
them, and put them on her back.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Then he puts his left
hand behind his back,

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
is where he's drawing
the Prana or the Qi,

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.380 align:middle line:84%
from his point of
view-- from Nature--

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and his other hand
on the towels.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And when he does, all
you hear is (HISSING).

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And then she says it felt just
like within about a second,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:90%
like you're going to be burned.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.895 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd move it to
another spot, and (HISSING).

00:23:44.895 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:84%
He was doing this, letting
her feel the energy.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, she
came back home,

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.991 align:middle line:90%
and she tells me all this stuff.

00:23:52.991 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, like, well, I
want to feel the energy.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.131 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You didn't tell me it was
going to be that good.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:90%
And so I run down there.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I say, Master Zhou, Claudette
says, and can you show me

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:90%
that--?

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:90%
He's was laughing.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:90%
He goes, OK, sure, sure.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:90%
So he lays me down.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I take off my shirt
and he lays me down.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.996 align:middle line:90%
He puts the towels on there.

00:24:17.996 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:84%
(HISSING) And tell you, it was
incredible, I mean incredible.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like it
was going to burn me.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And right at the moment when I
felt it was going to burn me,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:84%
he would move it to another
spot, and move around.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:90%
But Qi can be hot.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I just watched a video
of another Qigong master

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:84%
just a paper-- broke
it into flames.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:90%
You could see it start burning.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we became
friends after that.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
I asked him if I

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
could bring a filming
crew in from Hollywood

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:90%
to film all this stuff.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:90%
And he says, oh, yeah, sure.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I got us all together,
and we went down to his office.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And it just looks like a
suite in another building.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And his secretary was about
a 50-year-old Chinese woman,

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.880 align:middle line:90%
very sweet person.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:90%
And here we're in.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
We're there with cameras
and all this junk and stuff.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And she says we've
got to sit down.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:90%
He's working on someone.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:90%
It'll be about a half an hour.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:90%
And so we said, OK.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:90%
We're just sitting there.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And she comes back
a moment later,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and she goes, oh Mr. Zhou was
just on television a week ago.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
She says, would you like
to see what happened?

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:90%
And we go, yeah, yeah, sure.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So she rolls a television
up to us on a little stand,

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and puts in this-- I think--
this was a long time ago.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I think it was actually a
VCR that she put in there.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And he had just been on that
show, "That's Incredible."

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:90%
It's very appropriate for him.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
all of it, but what

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I do remember is the
first thing they did was

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
they took a temperature
gun-- what's

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.839 align:middle line:90%
shaped kind of like a gun.

00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can aim it at
anything in the room.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And you hit the trigger.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you a readout
of the temperature.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is, you don't
have to actually go over to it.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.780 align:middle line:84%
You can just look at,
and tell you what it is.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were describing
to the audience

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:84%
how it worked, and showed
them a thing on the side.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:90%
They first did that.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Then the next thing, when
they opened the curtains,

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
there's a giant, round kiln
about so big inside of there.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:90%
But it's off to the side.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's this guy in an
asbestos suit with a mask

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:90%
and these long tongs on there.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And so nobody knows
what's going to happen.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they take a
piece of metal-- steel--

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that's about this long,
about that wide, and maybe

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:90%
a quarter-inch thick.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.605 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty heavy,
looked like it was

00:27:06.605 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:90%
a pretty heavy piece of steel.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And the guy with the tongs
puts it at the end of his tongs

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and holds away
from him like this.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And Master Zhou walks in,
puts one hand behind his back,

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:90%
puts his hand up like that.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And you see up in
that little corner

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.561 align:middle line:84%
the little temperature gun
that's aiming at this thing.

00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And instantly-- I
mean, instantaneously

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:84%
when he goes like that, the
numbers go brrr, like that.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And after about-- it wasn't
very long-- 30, 40 seconds,

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:90%
the metal starts turning orange.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was heating that piece
of metal up to orange hot.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how hot
that is-- probably

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
1800 degrees or
something like that.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
everybody's going wow.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And then the guy drops that.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And he goes over to the kiln.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And he takes a piece
of metal out that

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.730 align:middle line:90%
had been heated to white hot.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.550 align:middle line:90%
White hot has got to be hot.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
melting point of steel is,

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:90%
or whatever that was.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:90%
But this thing was white hot.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can't even be
near stuff like that.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.410 align:middle line:84%
We're working with things
like this right now.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:84%
You just open a
kiln and-- I mean,

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:84%
when you get around
something that hot, the heat

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:90%
is tremendous.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And so he's holding
it up like that.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.927 align:middle line:84%
And Master Zhou
walks over to it.

00:28:34.927 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:90%
And they put a close-up of this.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.926 align:middle line:84%
And here's the piece
of metal like this.

00:28:37.926 --> 00:28:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And he goes-- he licks it.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.604 align:middle line:84%
He runs his tongue
over the top of it.

00:28:44.604 --> 00:28:48.110 align:middle line:90%
He does that twice.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he sticks it in his
mouth, and bytes off a piece,

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.076 align:middle line:90%
and spits it out.

00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:56.325 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the audience
goes, that's incredible.

00:28:56.325 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And then he did a bunch
of other things like that.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.212 align:middle line:84%
We're watching that,
and we're kind of almost

00:29:09.212 --> 00:29:09.920 align:middle line:90%
at the end of it.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And then he comes out, and
we went and did a filming

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a man
who is truly a master,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:84%
definitely understands
this whole thing

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.980 align:middle line:90%
about belief patterns.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:90%
And he also is a healer.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.340 align:middle line:90%
He can heal almost anything.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But you could never
heal something

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:84%
that somebody does-- if
you don't want to live,

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.750 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want to be healed,
I don't care who you are.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:90%
You can't heal them.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any difference.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
If they want to go,
they have the right.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:90%
They can go.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, there's
another healing

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:84%
that I watched take
place in my life.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:90%
I was also at Taos.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was also within
a year of the other one

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:90%
with the teddy bear.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was the importance
of asking permission.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.840 align:middle line:84%
This was another woman
that I was friends with.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And she was completely healthy.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:84%
She was in her late '20s, I
think-- nothing wrong at all.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.771 align:middle line:84%
And in a single
day, she got sick

00:30:22.771 --> 00:30:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and had to go to the hospital.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And they told her she
had three days to live.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of shocking.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I went there to see
her, I did the same thing.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I asked her if I
could try to help.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.590 align:middle line:90%
And she said yes.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But when I brought
in her higher self,

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I never have before,
or since, or ever,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:84%
ever before had a
reaction like this.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:84%
The higher self just
says, No, leave.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:90%
And I went, wow.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.010 align:middle line:90%
I was almost offended, in a way.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:06.710 align:middle line:90%
It was so, so aggressive.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I just told
her, I said, I'm sorry.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I can't do anything.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.730 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing I can do.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And I just gave her
big hug, a long hug,

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:84%
because I figured
when I leave here,

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll probably never
see her again.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:26.120 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was right about when

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.550 align:middle line:84%
she was supposed to die,
she figured it out herself.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.670 align:middle line:90%
She figured everything else out.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
She figured out exactly
what had happened, when,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:38.600 align:middle line:90%
She changed it.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:90%
She healed herself.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And she walked out of that
hospital perfectly whole,

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
without anybody
helping her at all.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:90%
And that was the point.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:84%
That was why the higher
self was so aggressive,

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
because it knew that she was
right there, ready to do this.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And if I messed
around at that time,

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
it would've been the
worst thing ever.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And so really have
to be careful.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
interfere with someone.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good thing.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to ask the effect
that you've achieved from

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:84%
the base of the spine and only
through meditation you can

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:84%
delineate from the
base of the spine--

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.460 align:middle line:84%
if you can say something
about the relationship between

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] and the Prana that
we use from way down and way up

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.760 align:middle line:90%
at the apexes of--

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean how it
enters into the body?

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, because when using
the Merkaba the Prana,

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.450 align:middle line:84%
we see the flow come
from up and down.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are usages
of Qi that come only

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:90%
from the base of the spine.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, there's lots of
ways of looking at this.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And China has looked at what
we're doing with the Merkaba.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And their response was,
after they've studied it,

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:84%
is that they're calling
it Western Qigong.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
just pulling Prana

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.320 align:middle line:84%
in from a dimensional
level rather than

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:90%
from this dimension.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We're pulling it from
the fourth dimension

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
or higher-- depends on
how you set your tubes.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And so in this sphere
that you have right here,

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.690 align:middle line:84%
you have super concentrated
Prana-- stronger

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.910 align:middle line:84%
than anything you can
get from using your hand

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:19.760 align:middle line:90%
to pull from Nature.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're not applying
it in that way yet,

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:90%
because we haven't.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:90%
That's not been taught.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.290 align:middle line:90%
All we taught was how to do it.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:34.460 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, anything
you know about Qigong

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
can be applied
directly from this,

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.895 align:middle line:84%
using this sphere of energy
where it's coming in.

00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:90%
You could pull that energy.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.478 align:middle line:84%
You could send it
around your body.

00:33:41.478 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:90%
You could send it out.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:84%
You could send it out
through your Chakra points.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:84%
You can send it out
through your eyes.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.780 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
ways you can do it.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's still-- Prana is Prana.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Only this is like
super-concentrated Prana.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, in terms of the spine, from
my understanding, what they're

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:84%
doing is they're
not pulling it--

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:09.690 align:middle line:84%
they're pulling it from Nature
itself and then into the spine

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.810 align:middle line:90%
through there.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:15.280 align:middle line:84%
But the super-psychic
kids that are

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:84%
around the world, and
especially the ones in China,

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.580 align:middle line:84%
they're doing something
that I've never seen ever.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And they pull the energy in
between the fourth and fifth

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:90%
lumbar at 90 degrees.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So they have it coming in like
this, making a 90-degree turn

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and going up, completely
missing the base of the spine

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And I thought it was strange.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.150 align:middle line:90%
And I tried it.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:90%
It seems to work.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.344 align:middle line:84%
But why they're doing
that, I still don't know.

00:34:46.344 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if you've been
studying Qigong, anything

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
that you know about Qigong--
once you have the Prana, how

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:84%
you apply it-- that's
the part that most of us

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:90%
don't know too much about.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe the
38 people here do,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:84%
but most people don't
have any understanding

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:11.220 align:middle line:90%
of how to use Prana.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
A real quick thing--
Prana-- each one of the five

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.910 align:middle line:84%
platonic solids-- and we're
missing the tetrahedron--

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:90%
are the elements.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.780 align:middle line:84%
There are six elements,
not five or four.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.860 align:middle line:84%
There are six
elements in existence.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:84%
There's fire, earth, air,
water, ether, and void.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And ether is Prana or Qi.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at these shapes,

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:53.350 align:middle line:84%
fire is the tetrahedron-- that--
which is the diagonals of this.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:90%
So they're interconnected.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:90%
And this is earth.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet inside of
the earth, you're

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.560 align:middle line:84%
going to see-- if you connect
the six faces together--

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%
you get an octahedron,
which is air.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.910 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And the air connects to this
one, because inside of the air

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.710 align:middle line:90%
is an octahedron also.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is an icosahedron,
which is water.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And water-- if you connect the
centers of the 12 pentagons,

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.270 align:middle line:84%
you get these two
things are duals.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.940 align:middle line:90%
They connect together.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:35.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the outer shell of
your entire Merkaba field.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a sphere
that contains it all.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And these two things,
interconnected together,

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:84%
which is this one-- this
one here-- that's these.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Water and ether-- water and
Prana together-- creates this.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Christ
consciousness grid,

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.470 align:middle line:84%
or the unity grid that's
around the Earth right now.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is going to
save humanity, this thing.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a living
field up there.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about what
I was about to come to

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
was that Prana is
connected directly to void.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And void is the sphere.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Void is the vacuum
is the void, which

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.240 align:middle line:84%
is the infinite energy--
near infinite energy.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to imagine
how much energy there

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is in almost nothing,
in one cubic centimeter

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.330 align:middle line:90%
space with nothing in it.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:36.867 align:middle line:84%
And doesn't matter if you're
inside of the middle of a rock

00:37:36.867 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:84%
or if you're in deep
space and there's

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:90%
an absolute complete vacuum.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.200 align:middle line:84%
That one quarter inch
has enough energy,

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:52.430 align:middle line:84%
based on E equals Mc squared,
to create the entire universe

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.430 align:middle line:90%
that Hubble telescope can see.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's in every
physics book in the world.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:90%
It's fact.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:00.150 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:04.520 align:middle line:84%
It still blows your
mind, but it's true.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all these free
energy machines that they're

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
coming out with, and what some
people call "zero point," which

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.670 align:middle line:90%
is not a good name.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I was just with
Doctor William Teller--

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:84%
we're on radio together--
and I use "zero point".

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.180 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, no.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Zero point is absolute zero,
which is zero Kelvin degrees.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And so some people are
linking that concept

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.960 align:middle line:84%
with the vacuum, which are
really two different things.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:90%
I never realized that before.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:90%
But so Prana contains water.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.594 align:middle line:90%
Water contains air.

00:38:46.594 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Air contains Earth.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And Earth contains fire.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have Prana,
you have everything.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.490 align:middle line:84%
This is why right now, there
are 50,000 people on Earth,

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:01.790 align:middle line:84%
scientifically that
have been mapped

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.270 align:middle line:90%
that do not eat food or water.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't drink water.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat food.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.240 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And they found 5,000
babies in China

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.559 align:middle line:84%
that never ate or drank
anything from birth-- ever.

00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:90%
They're fine.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.850 align:middle line:90%
They're totally healthy.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And they usually
don't sleep, either.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.540 align:middle line:84%
They sleep usually only about
an hour and a half a day,

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:84%
which is the same length of
time that dolphins sleep--

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:90%
an hour and a half a day.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And so their sleeping
process is brought way down.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.240 align:middle line:84%
They have a major
amounts of energy.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.310 align:middle line:90%
They never are tired.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.940 align:middle line:90%
They're super energized.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can synthesize
every molecule

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.530 align:middle line:84%
in existence-- organic
molecule in existence,

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.940 align:middle line:90%
no exceptions-- just by Prana.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's how important
Prana is-- the key to life.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we go
fourth-dimensional,

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:84%
we will not eat or
drink anything, either.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.500 align:middle line:90%
We simply won't need to.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And we won't even
think about it.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this right
now, if you want to.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman, Jasmuheen
who's teaching this.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to,
you can learn how.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:84%
My publisher--
Conrad is his name.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:27.752 align:middle line:84%
And he was dropping me off
at the airport one time.

00:40:27.752 --> 00:40:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to the
restaurant, and I was just

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.418 align:middle line:90%
eating something.

00:40:30.418 --> 00:40:32.181 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't eating.

00:40:32.181 --> 00:40:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you're not hungry?

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, no, I
don't eat anymore.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:37.290 align:middle line:90%
I say, what do you mean?

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.248 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, I finally
read Jasmuheen's book.

00:40:39.248 --> 00:40:40.370 align:middle line:90%
And I just did it.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat food anymore.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.200 align:middle line:84%
He hadn't eaten a
bite in six months,

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.370 align:middle line:90%
or water-- either one of them.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
about it is that he

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:53.960 align:middle line:84%
says he's learned that you can
put an on and off switch on it.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.642 align:middle line:84%
And so you can eat for six
months and stop for six months,

00:40:56.642 --> 00:40:57.600 align:middle line:90%
and eat for six months.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Or any time you want,
you can just stop eating.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:04.870 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
handy thing to know.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.334 align:middle line:90%

And you can just go on
the internet and find out.

She wrote a book called
"Living on Light,"

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.230 align:middle line:84%
where it takes 21 days to
be able to convert over,

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.980 align:middle line:84%
which really has to do with
breaking down your belief

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.080 align:middle line:84%
patterns about
that you need food.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you come to a place
where, OK, I don't need food.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you believe
that, you don't need food.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.270 align:middle line:90%
But there's a science behind it.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it isn't
just that you do it.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
once you know how

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:84%
to breathe Prana-- which you
all do it through the Merkaba--

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.580 align:middle line:84%
you can take this
sphere and not eat.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I've really thought
about doing this.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.196 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't too
concerned, because I

00:41:50.196 --> 00:41:52.320 align:middle line:84%
know that as soon as we go
to the fourth dimension,

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.830 align:middle line:84%
we just automatically
don't eat food.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting to
me, because she's actually

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.880 align:middle line:84%
interpenetrating the fourth
dimension by moving it

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.900 align:middle line:90%
into the third dimension.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.790 align:middle line:84%
But I still didn't get
interested until recently, she

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:84%
has another one that she's
doing, where she does it

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:84%
in Thailand with Mantak Chia,
who's a Chinese Tantra Master.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And he has a dark--
a special house that

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.070 align:middle line:90%
is completely black inside.

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And the people
that serve you have

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.810 align:middle line:84%
goggles on that they can see
at night and all this stuff.

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And they take you in there
for 10 days in total darkness.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And in 10 days, you come out.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to not
eat food or water again.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:43.819 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
number of days

00:42:43.819 --> 00:42:45.360 align:middle line:84%
was interesting to
me, because that's

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:84%
what the Kogis and the Arhuacos
and the Wiwas and the Kankuamos

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.950 align:middle line:84%
do in South America
and Columbia,

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:55.710 align:middle line:84%
is they go into
totally dark rooms.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And they do this
little dance that they

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.394 align:middle line:84%
do for nine days and nine
nights with no food or water.

00:43:02.394 --> 00:43:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they come
out of that, it

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.150 align:middle line:84%
puts them solidly into
their heart forever.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was the way
that they actually

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.230 align:middle line:84%
want to be to put you
into your heart first.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.555 align:middle line:84%
But I had to explain to
them that we were too weak.

00:43:14.555 --> 00:43:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:22.550 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't stand up for one
night without food or water

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:90%
or sleep.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't sleep
either-- nothing.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the tenth
day when this thing

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:33.100 align:middle line:84%
happens that I felt I wanted
to do what she was doing

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:37.174 align:middle line:84%
to see what the relationship
was between the heart-- I figure

00:43:37.174 --> 00:43:38.590 align:middle line:84%
actually what's
really going on is

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.040 align:middle line:90%
you're going into your heart.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is where
you're making the change.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And I have still
a strong feeling

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.090 align:middle line:90%
that's what's happening.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.020 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I used to work with
this guy, Bob Dratch .

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And he's an extremely
brilliant person-- so brilliant

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.830 align:middle line:90%
they can't measure him.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:84%
The way that Bob
Dratch worked is

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that he would use his
left brain logically

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:90%
to create what he was creating.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.642 align:middle line:84%
He knew exactly where
he wanted to go.

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But whenever he
would get somewhere

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.225 align:middle line:84%
and he had to know a certain
frequency or something

00:44:08.225 --> 00:44:10.230 align:middle line:84%
else, normally with
the scientific method,

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.438 align:middle line:84%
you had to start doing
experimentation and everything

00:44:12.438 --> 00:44:14.490 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what it was.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.020 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have to do any
experimentation ever.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:84%
He would just get to that
point, and as soon as he did,

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.544 align:middle line:84%
he would just go, OK, I
need to know what this is.

00:44:22.544 --> 00:44:24.710 align:middle line:84%
He would just close his
eyes, go into the right side

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:84%
of his brain and
ask, what is it?

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.635 align:middle line:90%
And the number would come.

00:44:30.635 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:90%
He would put it down.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.170 align:middle line:84%
It worked perfectly,
and keep going.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.774 align:middle line:84%
And so it was pretty
extraordinary what

00:44:38.774 --> 00:44:40.440 align:middle line:84%
we were able to do
in the length of time

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.350 align:middle line:90%
we were able to do things.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we created-- or he created,

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.586 align:middle line:84%
really-- but he was
using me in the sense

00:44:48.586 --> 00:44:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that I was giving
him the understanding

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry
and how that worked.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.342 align:middle line:90%
And once he got it, he got it.

00:44:54.342 --> 00:44:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And he got it really fast.

00:44:56.090 --> 00:45:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And so he made this instrument
that, when you looked at it,

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.770 align:middle line:84%
a normal scientist
would not have

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.700 align:middle line:90%
any idea how this thing worked.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, the electrical
circuits aren't even connected.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.120 align:middle line:84%
He discovered that on
the walls in Egypt,

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and on the walls in the Celtic
drawings that were in Ireland,

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.700 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, that many
of those were actually

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.830 align:middle line:90%
electrical circuits.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.710 align:middle line:90%
And they were into electronics.

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It's now been proven
scientifically, conclusively,

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that Egypt was into electronics
above and beyond what

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.070 align:middle line:90%
we are now.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And the military's kind of
going crazy over all of this.

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:42.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, right behind
here in Sedona--

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians were here in
Arizona a long time ago.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.650 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt
about that, if you've

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:48.890 align:middle line:90%
done your research on it.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:53.120 align:middle line:84%
In 1905, they found a
cave that went 1,400 feet

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.672 align:middle line:90%
off the Colorado River in there.

00:45:54.672 --> 00:45:55.630 align:middle line:90%
They went down into it.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.838 align:middle line:84%
And there were all these
mummies, Egyptian artifacts,

00:45:57.838 --> 00:45:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian writing,
everything else.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1925, they found
another whole mountain,

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.210 align:middle line:84%
which is called Isis Mountain,
unfortunately-- to give it

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:07.990 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.520 align:middle line:90%
And they went in there.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, they pulled out
all kinds of Egyptian stuff.

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.409 align:middle line:84%
Both of those
events were written

00:46:17.409 --> 00:46:18.450 align:middle line:90%
in the "Arizona Gazette."

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:22.250 align:middle line:84%
One of them was six pages
long, with all the photographs

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.450 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.020 align:middle line:90%
And the other one was earlier.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:28.830 align:middle line:84%
But it again
explained everything.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And then a man--
we have his name,

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.780 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know it right
now, from this group

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.360 align:middle line:84%
of the government, this
one particular person--

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.850 align:middle line:84%
didn't like the idea that
the Egyptians were here

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:44.190 align:middle line:84%
before Christopher Columbus,
and took all of these artifacts,

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and put them on a barge
out in the Atlantic

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.430 align:middle line:90%
and dumped them in the water.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's been documented also.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:57.780 align:middle line:84%
He just didn't want us to
change our ideas about this.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But right now, they
found another mountain

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.440 align:middle line:90%
next to Isis mountain.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.090 align:middle line:84%
For over 15 years now there's
been a huge fence around it.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.594 align:middle line:84%
Military's there, all dressed in
black with little machine guns.

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.010 align:middle line:84%
If you try to get
in there, you're

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:15.220 align:middle line:90%
probably not going to make it.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's even a no-fly
zone-- 10,000 feet.

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:19.870 align:middle line:84%
You're not even
able to fly over it.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And whatever's in there
has really intrigued them.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:25.440 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, it would take
me three or four hours

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.800 align:middle line:90%
tell you this story.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But they found the
underground city in Egypt.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.560 align:middle line:84%
It's eight miles long,
six a half miles wide.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's one building,
12 stories deep.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And remember in
the book, we said

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:40.640 align:middle line:90%
that it'll pull 10,000 people.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And they now are in
there absolutely.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And they've been in
there since 1997.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And they have found
electronics in there

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.240 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything we have
ever understood at all.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And so Motorola paid $60
million for a little,

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
tiny building just to
get access into there,

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.830 align:middle line:84%
a little adobe building that
was probably worth $0.10.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.747 align:middle line:84%
And so also, right
behind here out

00:48:09.747 --> 00:48:13.420 align:middle line:84%
at Boynton Canyon behind
the Enchantment place--

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.870 align:middle line:84%
the Enchantments now has
been bought by the military.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And they have built
underground tunnels

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.570 align:middle line:84%
from there over to where this
place was, and down inside

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:27.110 align:middle line:84%
where they have found--
we believe that it's

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian stuff also,
because they just will not

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.070 align:middle line:90%
let go of this one.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:33.190 align:middle line:90%
It's too big for them.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people going
to this resort over here,

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.090 align:middle line:84%
they're driving up
in civilian clothes,

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.120 align:middle line:90%
but they're really military.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.360 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
understand the ancient past

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.385 align:middle line:84%
and how it can be
applied to the present.

00:48:48.385 --> 00:48:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a
normal thing to do.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But so what Bob did was
he created an instrument

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.072 align:middle line:84%
that he called-- it
started out as the Pulse.

00:49:04.072 --> 00:49:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Pulse is a germicidal
lamp, which

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.520 align:middle line:84%
is based on the technology
that we're using.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.900 align:middle line:90%
It was a mercury vapor lamp.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:14.640 align:middle line:84%
We used that, because it had
been grandfathered by the FDA.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And we were primarily going
after the UV-A, B and C.

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we had
create an instrument that

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:30.010 align:middle line:84%
would heal all disease-- every
single disease in the world,

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:32.230 align:middle line:90%
and usually within two minutes.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:middle line:90%
They arrested us for that.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.960 align:middle line:84%
They took everything away from
us, and wouldn't let us go.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they said you
can't have something

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.540 align:middle line:90%
that cures everything.

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.570 align:middle line:84%
The United States, one-seventh
of our Gross National Product

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.045 align:middle line:90%
is people dying and sick.

00:49:47.045 --> 00:49:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you took that
away, it would destroy us.

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it was Canada,
it would be a blessing.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in Canada,
it would actually

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.090 align:middle line:84%
solve a lot of their
financial problems.

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:01.830 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't here.

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we changed that
little device after that.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And we created
something that you

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.120 align:middle line:84%
think that the medical
community would go nuts over,

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.660 align:middle line:84%
because we were able
to look inside the body

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:20.650 align:middle line:90%
without any evasive action.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We're not putting anything into
the body-- no magnetic fields

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:27.000 align:middle line:90%
or ultrasound or anything else.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do, you are not
seeing what's really happening.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.190 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing what's happening
because of that influence.

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't
see the real time

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.720 align:middle line:90%
of what's really happening.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:42.230 align:middle line:84%
But we had found a way to
take the microwaves that

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:44.485 align:middle line:84%
are coming off of molecules--
molecules are vibrating

00:50:44.485 --> 00:50:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're
producing microwaves,

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:51.710 align:middle line:84%
but at very low energy
levels-- 3 or 4 degrees Kelvin.

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And we had figured
out a way to-- science

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.890 align:middle line:84%
normally thinks that if you
look at something that's 3

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.600 align:middle line:84%
or 4 degrees Kelvin, you have
to make an instrument that's

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.630 align:middle line:84%
sitting at 3 to 4, and you have
to cool the instrument down

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:06.500 align:middle line:84%
physically down
to 3 or 4 degrees,

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.160 align:middle line:84%
otherwise the instrument
is vibrating so loud

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.820 align:middle line:84%
you can't hear this
very soft thing.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.740 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.530 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know how
to make the right circuits.

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And so using what we
learned out of Ireland,

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:25.460 align:middle line:84%
we created these spiraling
circuits that you can adjust,

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.307 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
connected to each other.

00:51:27.307 --> 00:51:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But yet you have a board
with them on there.

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
circuit's not connected.

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But you put electricity
at this end,

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.080 align:middle line:90%
and it comes out the other end.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.030 align:middle line:84%
A normal electrical
engineer could not

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:41.770 align:middle line:84%
explain this by what he
was taught in school.

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.860 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we were doing.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we
were able to create

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.321 align:middle line:84%
an instrument that can look
inside the body and watch

00:51:49.321 --> 00:51:49.820 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.028 align:middle line:84%
You could just watch the
blood flowing through there,

00:51:52.028 --> 00:51:54.130 align:middle line:84%
or watch the heart
beating, or go in the brain

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and just watch it doing
whatever you want.

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:57.760 align:middle line:84%
You could look at for
hours, and hours, and hours.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're not doing anything,
because all you're doing

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is-- it's just
like a photograph.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.210 align:middle line:84%
You take a photograph and
you're receiving light

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:04.920 align:middle line:90%
that comes off of the body.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.580 align:middle line:84%
We were receiving
microwaves that

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.966 align:middle line:90%
were coming off the molecules.

00:52:07.966 --> 00:52:09.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's three dimensional.

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:12.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not just on the surface,
but it's inside the body.

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we could adjust
our focus and go

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:19.730 align:middle line:84%
into any particular point, and
just watch what was going on,

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and without any evasion action.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And that led us to
a lot of discoveries

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.260 align:middle line:84%
about the human body
that you probably

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.460 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't know normally.

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many things that
the medical community has not

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:41.100 align:middle line:84%
even begin to understand yet,
even what the blood vessels are

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.707 align:middle line:90%
and how they are formed.

00:52:42.707 --> 00:52:44.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't really understand that.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:44.940 align:middle line:90%
It looks like chaos.

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.370 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have
figured it out.

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they have
a whole science that

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:53.390 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely extraordinary.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
any idea of that

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.290 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world over here.

00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that we could do

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:04.240 align:middle line:84%
was to find out
where a person had

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.330 align:middle line:90%
their attention in their body.

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:07.650 align:middle line:90%
You could actually see it.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:08.490 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:11.270 align:middle line:84%
You have a person standing
here, and if you, say,

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:13.080 align:middle line:84%
have your attention
in this hand,

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.010 align:middle line:84%
there's a little sphere about
that big, and it's glowing.

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And if they move the sphere
up their arm and over here

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:22.600 align:middle line:84%
into their hand,
you could actually

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.680 align:middle line:84%
see that little sphere
going over there.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Or if they just was
here and then there,

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:31.250 align:middle line:84%
you'd see here and
appear over there--

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:32.860 align:middle line:90%
depends on how they did it.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But you could see where
they were focused.

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And so this led
us to a discovery.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.390 align:middle line:84%
This discovery is
really important

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:44.190 align:middle line:90%
to know if you're a healer.

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:45.390 align:middle line:90%
It'll change everything.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.190 align:middle line:90%
It did for me.

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:middle line:84%
What we discovered from
this is we realized,

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.290 align:middle line:84%
well, we can see where
somebody is focused-- where

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:55.280 align:middle line:90%
they're centered in their body.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind of
an interesting thing.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided to
start studying healers

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.650 align:middle line:90%
to see where they're focused.

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And we brought in
a lot of healers.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:06.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember how many.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot-- it
was 80, 90, or 100.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It took us a long
time to do this.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And we were picking people
who had written books

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.290 align:middle line:84%
on the different
techniques of healing.

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we were trying to
get every technique that we

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.270 align:middle line:90%
could find and think of.

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:28.060 align:middle line:90%
And then so we get the person.

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.822 align:middle line:84%
They'd be healing
somebody on a table.

00:54:30.822 --> 00:54:32.280 align:middle line:84%
They would start
doing their thing.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And we'd say, OK,
tell us when you're

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.450 align:middle line:90%
doing whatever you're doing.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say,
OK, I'm doing it.

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And then we go for it.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And we would scan,
not the person's

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:44.700 align:middle line:84%
body they were doing it,
but the healer's body.

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And after a long time,
it became pretty clear--

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:54.340 align:middle line:84%
every single case, they
were centered in their heart

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:58.060 align:middle line:90%
chakra-- every single case.

00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.230 align:middle line:84%
What this told us was
the healing technique

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean much.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Healing technique is
to convince the healer

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:middle line:90%
they can do something.

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:13.740 align:middle line:90%


00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.110 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:18.070 align:middle line:90%
This is what does it.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:21.880 align:middle line:84%
This is this connection of
love through your Sacred Heart.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.440 align:middle line:84%
That is where healing
comes from-- here.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
believe-- this point.

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And the science behind it
was pretty convincing to me.

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the technique
just gives you

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:38.970 align:middle line:84%
a way to focus your
energy in how to do it.

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But you don't really
need anything.

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:44.360 align:middle line:90%
You just can love the person.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:47.720 align:middle line:84%
If you can't love the
person, you can't heal.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.955 align:middle line:84%
This was clear out of
those two guys out of China

00:55:49.955 --> 00:55:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about in
another one a long time ago.

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:58.070 align:middle line:84%
There were two major
psychic people in China.

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:01.139 align:middle line:84%
They were one of
the earliest ones.

00:56:01.139 --> 00:56:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And they're about the same age.

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:05.620 align:middle line:84%
One of them was one that
was naturally born into it.

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
was trained into it.

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:84%
The one that was
naturally born into it,

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.720 align:middle line:90%
the Chinese people hate him.

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're afraid of him.

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And the other one,
they love him.

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:17.790 align:middle line:90%
They love him like Jesus.

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:18.760 align:middle line:90%
They love them.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the one that
they don't like

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:24.206 align:middle line:90%
is that his ego is so strong.

00:56:24.206 --> 00:56:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he can anything
psychically-- I mean,

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.755 align:middle line:90%
just anything.

00:56:27.755 --> 00:56:29.630 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the people
who was able to walk

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:30.860 align:middle line:90%
through a solid wall.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So was the other guy, could
walk through a solid wall.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But the guy that nobody likes
or is afraid of, if he's

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.240 align:middle line:84%
in an audience like
this and somebody

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.690 align:middle line:84%
doubts him, or doesn't like
him, or puts a negative feeling

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:52.220 align:middle line:90%
toward him, he hurts them.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.420 align:middle line:84%
He goes like this and
sends a ball of flame

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.290 align:middle line:90%
and sets them on fire.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I would not go to
any of his things

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.790 align:middle line:90%
myself-- only watch it on TV.

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's just
really not a nice guy.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And the other guy, they
just are all over him

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.610 align:middle line:90%
because he loves people.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.030 align:middle line:90%
He can heal anything.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:18.540 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is
the guy that everybody loves,

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and he loves them-- he can heal
anything, like I just said.

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.050 align:middle line:84%
He can just say it's
gone, and it's gone.

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But the other guy can do
anything, but he can't heal.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:33.050 align:middle line:84%
He cannot heal
anybody of anything,

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:36.840 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't care
what happens to them.

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're a
healer, that's what it is.

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.590 align:middle line:84%
You just really have to love
that person from your heart,

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:45.020 align:middle line:90%
from the depths of your soul.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find a way
to make it happen.

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm just throwing out
these bits of information

00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:57.580 align:middle line:90%
that I've learned.

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of
turning points in my life.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:02.650 align:middle line:90%
This is another one.

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And this one is crucial
not only for healing,

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.077 align:middle line:90%
but for everything.

00:58:10.077 --> 00:58:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
talking about healing,

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.910 align:middle line:84%
you're really talking
about everything anyway.

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:22.910 align:middle line:84%
But in quantum
physics, many things

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:25.530 align:middle line:84%
were learned in quantum
physics that were never

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:27.600 align:middle line:90%
known or understood before.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics is probably
not going to survive,

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:32.690 align:middle line:84%
because there are
other new theories that

00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:37.617 align:middle line:84%
are coming forth right now
that are so, so much better

00:58:37.617 --> 00:58:39.200 align:middle line:84%
than anything that
has ever come along

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.550 align:middle line:84%
before-- relativity, special
theory of relativity, quantum

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:45.390 align:middle line:84%
physics, superstring theory,
or any of these ideas

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:47.030 align:middle line:90%
that are coming out now.

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're just going to
be discarded and thrown away.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
new understandings

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that are coming out, even
what Nassim is doing,

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.620 align:middle line:84%
but also what the
Russians are doing.

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have something
that is so extraordinary,

00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.326 align:middle line:90%
it's incredible.

00:58:59.326 --> 00:59:01.800 align:middle line:90%


00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.240 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, looking at
just quantum physics

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.410 align:middle line:84%
as it is right now,
one of the things

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that was presented to
this is that the person

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:18.950 align:middle line:84%
who is performing the experiment
affects the experiment.

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:22.920 align:middle line:90%
They literally can change it.

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:27.350 align:middle line:84%
They can change the results just
by what they believe is true.

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And this is a big problem.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get into that idea
a little bit more tomorrow.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
in quantum physics

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:40.600 align:middle line:84%
is that you can see the
universe in one of two ways.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And you have to choose one.

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And you choose one, and you have
to throw the other one away,

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and not believe it.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.320 align:middle line:84%
You can only believe
one side or the other.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But whichever way
you do will work.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:03.230 align:middle line:84%
One is that everything is solid,
and that it's just solid stuff.

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.030 align:middle line:90%
It is particles.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We call them atoms, but they're
little pieces of universe

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that you could put together
to make everything up.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of atoms
as we think of them,

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.800 align:middle line:84%
with protons, electrons, and
neutrons, is just a theory.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.625 align:middle line:84%
They've had over 50
theories of what an atom is.

01:00:22.625 --> 01:00:24.250 align:middle line:84%
They keep going
through them until they

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:26.320 align:middle line:90%
got to the Bohr idea.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And ever since
then, they use that.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.480 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
most theorists really

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.990 align:middle line:84%
believe any of
that stuff anymore,

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:38.730 align:middle line:84%
because there's
too many anomalies.

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:42.370 align:middle line:90%
And there's something wrong.

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, you can see it as
either made up of particles,

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
or you can see it as just
energy-- waveform, vibration,

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:51.740 align:middle line:90%
sound.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:55.060 align:middle line:90%
And you could take your pick.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Almost all scientists-- when
did quantum physics come out?

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It was 1930s, wasn't is
somewhere around there?

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Anyway from whenever
it came out,

01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:10.220 align:middle line:84%
until about the mid '90s or
so, almost all physicists

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
in the world were
particle scientists.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really understand
it as energy at all.

01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Bob Dratch was one
of the first ones.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.140 align:middle line:90%
And he's changing the world.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are other ones now
who are changing the world.

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if you see
the world as energy,

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.479 align:middle line:84%
and you throw away
that other idea,

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
there are things that
you can do that looks

01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:34.470 align:middle line:90%
like magic from the other way.

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.260 align:middle line:84%
You just can't even
begin to do those things,

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
another idea in your head

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that will not work
on those levels.

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And so going back
to Qigong again,

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:48.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Greg Braden has a movie
that he shows a lot

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.210 align:middle line:90%
that he picked up out of China.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And probably many of you
have seen this, where there's

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.610 align:middle line:90%
a woman who has bladder cancer.

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And she's in China in a
hospital that is called

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.200 align:middle line:90%
the medicineless hospital.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.170 align:middle line:84%
They use no medicine
to heal anything.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.760 align:middle line:90%
They just use Prana or Qi.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.410 align:middle line:90%


01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And so in this hospital, this
woman with the bladder cancer

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
is lying on-- it looks
like a normal hospital.

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
She's lying on a table like
a normal hospital table.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a nurse there
with a computer screen,

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and she's shining the
ultrasound into her bladder.

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's picking
up on the screen,

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.770 align:middle line:90%
so you see it's rather enlarged.

01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
The bladder is about
that big on the screen.

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
cancer in there.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just this big,
black area that's

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
inside of there, that's
cancer in her bladder.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you could see
this scientifically.

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And then these four
young men come out.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And they look like
they're in early '20s.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
They come out, one
hand behind their back.

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And they all go like
this and aim it at there.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And exactly what's going on in
their heads, you don't know.

01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
But they're just doing that.

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:12.866 align:middle line:84%
And they're all at
once-- all four of them

01:03:12.866 --> 01:03:15.050 align:middle line:90%
at once are healing this person.

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But you can see on
the computer screen,

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and you can see the cancer.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.732 align:middle line:84%
And in just a little
over three minutes--

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
exact time, but it's

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
approximately three
or four minutes--

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.460 align:middle line:84%
you watch the cancer that
was that big on the screen

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
just go poof, gone--
non-existent anymore.

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And if those people that
were doing the healing

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
thought of the body as a solid
thing, they could not do that.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.400 align:middle line:90%
They see the body as energy.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like you have a guitar.

01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And an allopathic doctor
comes up to a guitar,

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and one of the strings is out.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:05.370 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, got to replace it.

01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Got to put a new string
on here and tune it.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But an energy person says, no,
there's nothing really wrong.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.020 align:middle line:90%
It's just not in tune.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.111 align:middle line:84%
And so all you've got to
do is go [TUNING SOUND]--

01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:18.180 align:middle line:90%
and everything's fine.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
You just tune back the energy
back to where it's supposed

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
to be, and then it's over.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really
different concept.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And so an allopathic doctor
has to use a physical way

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:34.530 align:middle line:90%
to solve the problem.

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
They have to give you
a pill, a medicine,

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.950 align:middle line:90%
something physical to do it.

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
They have to go in with
a knife to cut it out,

01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
because of the view that
they have of the reality.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But an energy doctor would
not need to do any of that.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:58.220 align:middle line:84%
There's other, more simple,
easier, faster, painless

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.790 align:middle line:90%
ways of doing this.

01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And the medical
community is beginning

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.100 align:middle line:90%
to understand this right now.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just beginning to change.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Canada made a huge
shift here recently,

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
where they allowed
medical doctors

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.150 align:middle line:90%
to use alternative methods.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
That's a no-no here
in the United States.

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But up there, they say,
if it works, do it.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.890 align:middle line:90%
If it works, why not?

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:37.080 align:middle line:90%
But you can't do that here.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we're slowly
beginning to understand this.

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And these kinds of
changes take a long time.

01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Even science itself,
physics, is just

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
now beginning to understand
what they said a long time ago.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
They're just beginning
now to get it.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I really
recommend that you

01:05:57.950 --> 01:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
begin to change your view
of what the outer world is

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
made out of, rather
than seeing it as solid

01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and made out of hard, little
particles that create it.

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But you begin to see everything,
and especially the human body,

01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
but it has to take it to
everything, as just energy.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And then from this
concept, Bob Dratch

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.900 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first
people, and maybe

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
the first person on Earth,
to actually come forth

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
with the word "waveform"
and what it actually is.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to do
things pretty amazing.

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:40.100 align:middle line:90%


01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Waveform is if you take this
bottle, which has water in it.

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
This has a vibration.

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
The vibration in all of its
fullness is called "waveform."

01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
mathematics and you just

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
see sine wave signature,
we're not talking about that.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:06.090 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a sine
wave shape signature over time.

01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:08.799 align:middle line:90%
And that is extremely complex.

01:07:08.799 --> 01:07:10.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like looking
at a mountain range

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
with every little, tiny, rock
and pine cone and tree on it.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a line.

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complex, up and
down pattern within the pattern,

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.600 align:middle line:90%
and it's over time.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So the pattern's
actually changing.

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
When you get a piece of that,
if you took a waveform of this,

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and then you created
that pattern-- poof--

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
you have another bottle
exactly the same,

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
with precisely the same
number of atoms in it,

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
same number of atoms or
molecules of water in there,

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and everything exactly the same.

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:43.440 align:middle line:90%
There's no difference at all.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.732 align:middle line:84%
And there's no difference
in this reality, either.

01:07:45.732 --> 01:07:46.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a bottle of water.

01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:47.670 align:middle line:90%
You can drink it.

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:48.960 align:middle line:90%
There's no difference.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.670 align:middle line:90%
And it just came from energy.

01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:53.780 align:middle line:90%


01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:56.360 align:middle line:84%
He made something called
a "God box," which

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
is a little, tiny box about an
inch high and about this big,

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
where you could take a medicine
and convert it into waveform,

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and then project it
like you can television

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.189 align:middle line:90%
or anything else like that.

01:08:11.189 --> 01:08:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So he could come in here
with a certain medicine,

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:14.521 align:middle line:90%
if he wanted to give it to you.

01:08:14.521 --> 01:08:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And he could either aim it at
one person, or wide-band it

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.127 align:middle line:90%
and shoot everybody in the room.

01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:20.460 align:middle line:90%
And you'd all get this medicine.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:23.640 align:middle line:84%
There would be no difference
if you injected it or if you

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
didn't-- zero difference
between the difference.

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:32.399 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like
I was asked to go

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.189 align:middle line:84%
to a hospital in San
Diego a few years ago,

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and there was a French doctor
there that was using waveform.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Only it was
interesting, because he

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
was using light-- what came
off the surface of the body.

01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:46.100 align:middle line:90%


01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.405 align:middle line:84%
And they used a menopause
medicine-- I don't really

01:08:51.405 --> 01:08:53.779 align:middle line:84%
know what it was, but it had
been around for a long time,

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:55.113 align:middle line:90%
and they knew it inside and out.

01:08:55.113 --> 01:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And they knew all
the side effects.

01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:57.935 align:middle line:90%
They knew everything about it.

01:08:57.935 --> 01:09:00.990 align:middle line:84%
They'd done 30 years
of research on this.

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And he simply took it and
put it into a piece of cloth.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.569 align:middle line:84%
He took the waveform, put
it into a piece of cloth.

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:12.279 align:middle line:84%
The person would hold the cloth
on their arm for 30 seconds.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was exactly the same
as if they took the pill.

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing it
in a different way.

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.020 align:middle line:84%
We were using the
microwaves, which

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:25.069 align:middle line:84%
I think it's better,
because it's not linear off

01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
the surface, but it's
three dimensional.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.920 align:middle line:90%
And we were taking that.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And we put it into
this little box.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.173 align:middle line:84%
And we took 2000 of
them-- 2,000 medicines.

01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:34.714 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
Star Trek, where

01:09:34.714 --> 01:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
you have that little
thing that [MAKES SOUND]

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.380 align:middle line:90%
and you could fix anything.

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, we actually have that.

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we
put in there was chocolate.

01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It was our demonstrator when
somebody wouldn't believe us.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.390 align:middle line:90%
[MAKES SOUND]

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, your whole
mouth is filled with chocolate.

01:09:57.250 --> 01:10:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Hmm, pretty good.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.230 align:middle line:84%
There is no
difference-- not any.

01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:05.334 align:middle line:84%
And if you did that
with a human being,

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:06.750 align:middle line:84%
you could duplicate
a human being.

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:07.791 align:middle line:90%
There'd be no difference.

01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:09.335 align:middle line:90%
It'd be exactly same body.

01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:11.054 align:middle line:84%
Now, the spirit
would be different.

01:10:11.054 --> 01:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what would
happen if you do that.

01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what happens
with spirit in that case.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But waveform is getting to
be pretty well understood.

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And lots of the
scientists and doctors

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.870 align:middle line:90%
are working with this now.

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:27.830 align:middle line:90%


01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
polarized, and so there

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
is an extremely positive
side, but there's

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.030 align:middle line:90%
an extremely negative side.

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
We were commissioned by a group
of medical doctors back East.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:46.437 align:middle line:84%
Their problem was they were
dealing with older people who--

01:10:46.437 --> 01:10:48.645 align:middle line:84%
and the biggest problem with
older people in medicine

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
is they just forget to
take their medicine.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
They can't remember to
do it, or they don't

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.870 align:middle line:90%
want to-- whatever the reason.

01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted us to put
it into so they could go over

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:03.200 align:middle line:90%
a telephone.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And we made it.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.090 align:middle line:90%
And it worked perfect.

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:08.840 align:middle line:90%
And so the telephone would ring.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.974 align:middle line:84%
The person would pick it up
and it would just go [BUZZ].

01:11:11.974 --> 01:11:12.640 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And they could
hang it back down.

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And all their medicine was
just put into their body.

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
That was another time we were
stopped by our government.

01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And I do see why they
stopped us on this one,

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:29.155 align:middle line:84%
because oh, my god,
you could kill anybody.

01:11:29.155 --> 01:11:31.530 align:middle line:84%
You can just put arsenic or
something else through there,

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and just eliminate
just by a phone call.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's going to happen.

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You can't stop these things once
somebody has thought about it.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.260 align:middle line:90%
It's in the grids.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to do it,
either positive or negative.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you could just
do it over a TV station,

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
actually, and kill 90 million
people in one second--

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:56.054 align:middle line:90%
I mean more than even thing.

01:11:56.054 --> 01:11:58.220 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you could
put it over a TV station

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and heal them of
everything in one second.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
But it would cause
more problems.

01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:08.140 align:middle line:90%


01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, science is there.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Waveform is a matter--
you could even

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
buy things for-- they have fuels
that would increase gasoline

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:17.980 align:middle line:90%
mileage.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Now they have it put
into a little patch

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.520 align:middle line:90%
you stick on your gas tank.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And you get 25% more horsepower
and about 30% more gas mileage.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Now another company's come
out with a whole series

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
of little plastic patches
for every conceivable problem

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:35.230 align:middle line:90%
you have.

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
And that stuff really works.

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
If you have allergies, you
put this little patch on.

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't have allergies
anymore-- on and on

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.460 align:middle line:90%
and on and on.

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It's just waveform.

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to bring
up one more thing, which

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's another
healing tool,

01:12:56.370 --> 01:13:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and the more I've worked
with this healing tool,

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.590 align:middle line:90%
it's quite amazing.

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is
that when you look

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:08.760 align:middle line:84%
at physical objects
that do things,

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.220 align:middle line:90%
they're just teaching tools.

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.880 align:middle line:90%
If it can do it, you can do it.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So every time I see how
something works in that way,

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
then I learn how to
do it without it,

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and do the same
thing, once I get

01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:25.070 align:middle line:90%
the concept of what it's doing.

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:28.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, we got another question.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to know if you tried
to apply this waveform theory

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
with a harmonizer instead
of just sending the--

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, yeah, that's
what we were doing.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.960 align:middle line:84%
The way that we were
healing the atmosphere

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.620 align:middle line:90%
was through waveform technology.

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We would take a cloud
right at the moment

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
when it's lightning and
starting to dump rain.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And we took the waveform off
of that and put that into a CD,

01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and then transmitted that sound
frequency, waveform frequency,

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
through a toroidal
field and out,

01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and expanded it out into Nature.

01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:09.260 align:middle line:90%
And it absolutely works.

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you try anything else
besides the rain cloud?

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, you can put
anything through it.

01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're back to that
positive and negative thing.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, the world
will come into balance.

01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But we are coming
to a point here,

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
which I think is going to
happen pretty soon, where all

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
of our technology-- we're
going to throw away--

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:38.030 align:middle line:84%
in a single day,
according to the prophecy.

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Because you go back
into the Vedas,

01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:43.825 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about this time
right now-- how we fly around

01:14:43.825 --> 01:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
in metal boxes, and we
learn about electricity

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and magnetism, and
we've developed

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.040 align:middle line:90%
this whole technology.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:53.770 align:middle line:84%
This is 5,000, 6,000 years
ago this was written down.

01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And then they predict
that a day will

01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:59.620 align:middle line:84%
come where it'll be
a single day, where

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
humanity will wake up and
realize who they really are.

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't that
we throw it away.

01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:10.280 align:middle line:90%
We just don't need it anymore.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.240 align:middle line:90%
What for?

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.370 align:middle line:90%
We can heal anything.

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:14.530 align:middle line:90%
We can do anything.

01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Anything we think, or
feel, or imagine we can do.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So technology just
becomes obsolete.

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>When you heal
the planet, do you

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:29.140 align:middle line:90%
ask permission of Mother Earth?

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And if so, have you
ever gotten a no?

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, yes, and yes.

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:37.080 align:middle line:90%


01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Any time you do
anything with the Earth,

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:42.620 align:middle line:84%
it is my belief that you
must ask her permission.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.950 align:middle line:90%
You're working on her body.

01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:47.781 align:middle line:84%
It's her body, and it usually
will influence other people,

01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:48.280 align:middle line:90%
too.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.467 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
to ask permission.

01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
When we were using
what he was talking

01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:53.424 align:middle line:84%
about-- this
toroidal fields that

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.040 align:middle line:84%
would stretch out
35 miles-- which

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.620 align:middle line:84%
we're now up to 6,000
miles-- and it could easily

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.170 align:middle line:90%
be switched over to planetary.

01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:03.580 align:middle line:84%
When she gives us
the permission, which

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:07.180 align:middle line:84%
hasn't happened yet, we could
connect into the Mercado field

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, at which point
anything can be transmitted

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.260 align:middle line:84%
globally, all
over-- and actually

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
from inside the
Earth through it,

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.980 align:middle line:84%
universally to the
entire universe.

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:22.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, yeah, when we first
started to do this,

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if this
was a good idea or not.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.540 align:middle line:90%
I did a little test.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I could see for
sure that it was real.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And so before we used it--
we were not far from here.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.190 align:middle line:90%
We had 55 people.

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And we went and did
a Medicine Wheel

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:45.020 align:middle line:84%
to ask Mother Earth if we
should use this or not.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.990 align:middle line:90%


01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty dramatic,
because White Buffalo Woman

01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:54.490 align:middle line:84%
appeared to everyone
in that circle.

01:16:54.490 --> 01:17:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And she told us that we could do
this-- that Mother Earth wanted

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:03.460 align:middle line:90%
to know if this would work.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:04.710 align:middle line:90%
But we had to be limited.

01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we were limited
to a 300 mile area.

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had a
300 mile area, which

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.240 align:middle line:84%
includes this place
we're in right now,

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.435 align:middle line:84%
but centered in Payson,
which is about 100

01:17:18.435 --> 01:17:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and something miles that
way-- 110 miles or so.

01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:25.670 align:middle line:90%


01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was for
environmental clearing

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:29.860 align:middle line:90%
of the atmosphere, et cetera.

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:36.129 align:middle line:84%
And Payson is now the cleanest
place on Earth-- scientifically

01:17:36.129 --> 01:17:36.920 align:middle line:90%
the cleanest place.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It went past everywhere,
even went past Iceland,

01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:42.350 align:middle line:90%
which was the cleanest place.

01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:44.626 align:middle line:90%
And they can't explain it.

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
say, well, it's

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
the Ponderosa trees are
eating the pollution.

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.180 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think so.

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
What it is is we've had
this field sitting there

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.960 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, running
these frequencies.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:03.969 align:middle line:84%
And you run the frequencies
even for 15, 20 minutes

01:18:03.969 --> 01:18:05.260 align:middle line:90%
and you can see the difference.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.380 align:middle line:84%
In 10 days, you can
really see the difference.

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
When you get up there on a
clear day with no clouds,

01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:13.320 align:middle line:90%
you see the mountains.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
mountains go right

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.968 align:middle line:90%
over the edge of the surface.

01:18:15.968 --> 01:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
It looks like there's
no atmosphere at all.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.730 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
little tiny peaks

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.732 align:middle line:84%
going over the top
of this thing there.

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know, normally you
can't see stuff like that,

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
because it's too much
stuff in the middle.

01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there
have been times when

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:35.085 align:middle line:84%
I have asked for permission
to do things from Mother Earth

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and she just said no.

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.180 align:middle line:90%
So I just don't do it.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.670 align:middle line:90%
And you could ask her why, too.

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:40.560 align:middle line:90%
She'll tell you why.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.890 align:middle line:90%
You're her child.

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:43.590 align:middle line:90%
She loves you.

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:46.180 align:middle line:90%


01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.480 align:middle line:90%
She'll tell you.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
If it's possible
for her to tell you,

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
she'll tell you why she
doesn't want you to do that.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:58.580 align:middle line:90%


01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.430 align:middle line:84%
What I want to
talk about now were

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:04.350 align:middle line:90%
something called the Dos disk.

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're D-O-S. I don't
even know what it stands for.

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:11.050 align:middle line:90%
It's Portuguese.

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:14.040 align:middle line:90%
It's from Brazil.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is a case where, yes,
we have these physical things.

01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:25.802 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned how to do what
they do with just your hands.

01:19:25.802 --> 01:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But I want to
explain what they do.

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can buy these
things if you want.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It was not possible to buy
them for a long, long time,

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.770 align:middle line:84%
because they were
medical instruments.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.375 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, it is
possible to buy them now.

01:19:37.375 --> 01:19:38.125 align:middle line:90%
They're expensive.

01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
They're not cheap--
$3,000 or $4,000.

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a healer,
they're pretty amazing.

01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Is Cal here?

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, come on.

01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.120 align:middle line:90%
This is Cal, Cal Garrison.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello.

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>And she's the Editor in
Chief of the Spirit of Ma'at

01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Magazine.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And she also has been
kind of coordinating

01:20:01.890 --> 01:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
everything with these disks and
what we've learned about them.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
These medical people,
what they found

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is they had discovered
mathematically what this was.

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But the reason they came was
because they had read my book.

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were, like, how did I
know that it was 34 this way,

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:19.350 align:middle line:90%
and 21 this way?

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
figured out all the

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
spin ratios, the mathematics,
the geometries, and everything.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And they were blown away
that someone had just

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:28.370 align:middle line:90%
written a book on it.

01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:31.584 align:middle line:84%
And they had spent 20 years
to come to that conclusion.

01:20:31.584 --> 01:20:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked me
a lot of questions.

01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we're all done-- they
asked me a million questions,

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:36.680 align:middle line:90%
actually.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And then when we were all
done, they said, well,

01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:41.130 align:middle line:90%
would you like to try it?

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I lay down, and I
didn't know what to expect.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And they just put these
disks on my Chakras.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And what they are is, they
are a healthy Chakra--

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.210 align:middle line:90%
perfectly healthy Chakra.

01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you put it on it, if
you've got a blocked Chakra,

01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
where it's all out of whack
and it's rotating incorrectly,

01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:07.637 align:middle line:84%
very quickly it goes into
a perfectly healthy system,

01:21:07.637 --> 01:21:09.220 align:middle line:84%
which means all your
energy is flowing

01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.470 align:middle line:90%
in your body and everything.

01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And so they put them on me.

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you're
probably going to go to sleep.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, I
go, I don't think so.

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they put them on my body,
and I was a sort of talking.

01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, what I do next?

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I just went to sleep.

01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
choice, kind of.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I woke up like an
hour and 15 minutes

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.270 align:middle line:90%
later and took them off.

01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And you feel fantastic
after this is over with.

01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You just feel like you've
had two night's sleep.

01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:43.700 align:middle line:90%
It's really great.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:47.490 align:middle line:90%
And then they gave them to me.

01:21:47.490 --> 01:21:49.139 align:middle line:84%
They said, we can't
sell them to you,

01:21:49.139 --> 01:21:50.430 align:middle line:90%
because they're medical things.

01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:51.230 align:middle line:90%
But here they are.

01:21:51.230 --> 01:21:52.813 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
you a set of them.

01:21:52.813 --> 01:21:54.610 align:middle line:90%
And then they left.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:55.910 align:middle line:90%
They left.

01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And two minutes later,
a woman came in.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And she was one
of the women that

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
was going to be in the
workshop the next day.

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And she was telling
me that she couldn't

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
come because her
husband had just

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
decided that he didn't
like her anymore,

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and asked for a divorce
that day before.

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And she was all red,
and she'd been crying,

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:25.460 align:middle line:90%
And so after, I said, that's OK.

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not OK,
but it's OK that you

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
don't come to the workshop.

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.580 align:middle line:90%
We understand.

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And so then my
little brain went,

01:22:36.810 --> 01:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I put them on
her, what would happen?

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And I try to convince her.

01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, can I just
lay these on you?

01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:43.970 align:middle line:90%
She says, no, I don't care.

01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I just got to go.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to ask her a couple
times, and finally she said, OK.

01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.912 align:middle line:90%
She lays down.

01:22:48.912 --> 01:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And she's sitting
there talking about it.

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.494 align:middle line:84%
She says, why does he
have to be such a jerk?

01:22:52.494 --> 01:22:53.690 align:middle line:90%
And she's going on and on.

01:22:53.690 --> 01:22:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm putting
these things on her.

01:22:55.340 --> 01:23:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And she's in the middle
of a sentence, "And he--"

01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's what I did.

01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:04.550 align:middle line:90%


01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
So I sat there.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was like an hour or
something before she came back.

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And she came back and was
just like a different person.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.590 align:middle line:84%
She says, wow, I
feel really good.

01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:14.150 align:middle line:90%
I go, yeah.

01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
She stands up and she
goes, hmm, you know what?

01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:20.815 align:middle line:84%
She says, "I think I will come
to your workshop tomorrow."

01:23:20.815 --> 01:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I say, "What about
your husband?"

01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:23.560 align:middle line:90%
She says, the hell with him.

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:28.990 align:middle line:90%


01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I took these back
and I started experimenting

01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:32.800 align:middle line:90%
with lots of people.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I was incredibly impressed
with all of this.

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:38.105 align:middle line:90%
And then years went by.

01:23:38.105 --> 01:23:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sell them.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.950 align:middle line:90%
I could only have one set.

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.100 align:middle line:90%
And then years went by.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.645 align:middle line:84%
And the medical
community in Brazil

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
had come to the place
where there are no side

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.150 align:middle line:90%
effects on this that are known.

01:23:48.150 --> 01:23:50.135 align:middle line:90%
You can't use them wrong.

01:23:50.135 --> 01:23:51.490 align:middle line:90%
You can use them right.

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But you can't use them where
it actually hurts anybody.

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they made it so
you could sell them.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.776 align:middle line:84%
And so we got them,
when was that about?

01:23:59.776 --> 01:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Gee, I think it
was two years ago.

01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, about two years ago.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can't handle
these kind of things.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Cal if she would
take this on, and begin

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:15.890 align:middle line:84%
to monitor what was happening
from around these things.

01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So just tell them
what you found.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>I love these things.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I call it
the therapist in the box.

01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:28.457 align:middle line:84%
All you healers
out there, you guys

01:24:28.457 --> 01:24:29.790 align:middle line:90%
are going to be out of business.

01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
My experience with them is
basically that everything

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.810 align:middle line:90%
that he said.

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:37.740 align:middle line:90%
I do sessions with myself.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I've done sessions
with other people.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I've done all different
kinds of things

01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:46.520 align:middle line:84%
with people who don't know
anything about this stuff.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.680 align:middle line:90%
They always do the same thing.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And the effects are the same.

01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the
person and their issues,

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to
use them more or less.

01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you a little
bit about my experience.

01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:03.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we'll start there.

01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:08.027 align:middle line:84%
So the first time I did it,
everything was laid on me.

01:25:08.027 --> 01:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's best to do
it when you're lying down,

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:12.620 align:middle line:84%
you're really comfortable,
and there's absolutely

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:13.970 align:middle line:90%
going to be no interference.

01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Because you can go out from
anywhere between 45 minutes

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.870 align:middle line:90%
and three hours.

01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the
feeling is like as your gliding

01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
into this experience, it takes
between five and 15 minutes

01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:29.650 align:middle line:90%
to sort of go out.

01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But then during
that time, you're

01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:34.877 align:middle line:84%
in this space where
there's nothing going on.

01:25:34.877 --> 01:25:35.960 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing happening.

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
You're not, like,
aware of anything.

01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:42.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like this total black
space that you can't remember.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any kind
of big stuff happening.

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But after three hours,
something in you opens its eyes

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.022 align:middle line:90%
and you look up.

01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
at that point,

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.620 align:middle line:84%
you realize that this process
of getting all of your Chakras

01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
to be spinning at the
proper speed ratio,

01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to have all of the
star tetrahedrons

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and each Chakra in the
proper relationship

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
to each other, this feeling
of balance is so unbelievable.

01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you've
always wanted to feel.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the healing process
is sort of a cumulative,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
so that every time you
use it, you get better,

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.820 align:middle line:90%
and you feel better.

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And not only do you feel better
inside, but sometimes what

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
happens is you
get these insights

01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
in how to just clear up the
mundane issues in your life.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:33.960 align:middle line:90%
I had an office.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd moved into
this little house.

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.532 align:middle line:90%
I lived there for two years.

01:26:37.532 --> 01:26:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I was in the middle
of writing two books,

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have time
to arrange my office.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And after my first or
second disk session--

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd been procrastinating about
dealing with this, because it

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:50.540 align:middle line:90%
was expensive and crazy.

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.260 align:middle line:84%
But I got up from a
disk session and I'd

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:55.930 align:middle line:84%
gotten this information while
I was in the session, I think.

01:26:55.930 --> 01:26:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But I got up and I straightened
the whole thing out in an hour.

01:26:59.890 --> 01:27:00.580 align:middle line:90%
You know I mean?

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't cost me anything.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So you get all kinds of
little practical tips.

01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
There is another thing
that happens, too.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you don't
go completely out.

01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I love the ones where you just
don't even know where you are.

01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:19.330 align:middle line:84%
There's another type of disk
session where you go in,

01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're sort of like
halfway between sleep and wake

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.150 align:middle line:90%
the whole time.

01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is just
these waves of imagery.

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Choo, choo, they just
keep coming over you.

01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's information
in that stuff.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So you get to find out what
you need to be looking at.

01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
the best ascension

01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:40.270 align:middle line:90%
tool that I have ever seen.

01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that everybody
in the universe

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
could get off Prozac
and all the crazy stuff

01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:49.120 align:middle line:84%
that people take, because
they make you feel great.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.336 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

understand what they are

01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and how they work, you
can do it without them.

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:07.276 align:middle line:84%

are a healer, there

01:28:07.276 --> 01:28:08.650 align:middle line:84%

you might want

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:11.710 align:middle line:84%
