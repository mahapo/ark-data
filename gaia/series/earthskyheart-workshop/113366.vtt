00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>The big question now is
who doesn't have a partner?

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you don't.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Actually, anybody
else over here?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.386 align:middle line:84%
OK, all the people that don't
have partners come over here

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:16.886 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
talk to each other.

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>The singles bar.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>The singles bar.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.034 align:middle line:90%
And we don't even have a bar.

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:23.375 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:25.222 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:84%
You got to have your
mask because this is

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:90%
all about dancing in the dark.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Face your partner.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Put on your masks.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And this dancing
is very sensual,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.358 align:middle line:90%
as you're going to see.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.814 align:middle line:90%
It's just dancing in darkness.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:90%
It's sensual moving.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:90%
But you'll see.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Face your partner.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And now we got to be quiet.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.456 align:middle line:90%
I know that's the hardest part.

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, one other thing.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:90%
There's always one other thing.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:90%
I got to show you something.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, no.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.237 align:middle line:84%
>>When you start
each dance, because I

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:84%
don't want to get into this when
we actually start the dances,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you start with your
hands like this.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So your fingers are facing up
and your palms are together.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, can you put them up higher?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Like this, only at
shoulder height.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be at this
height with your hands.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So every single dance we do,
we start from that position.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll lead you into
where we go from there.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
But right now, we're going to do
10 minutes or so of Blue School

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.057 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:02:10.057 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't need your
partner right now.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
do it by yourself.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:90%
They'll be in front of you.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But face your partner,
know where they are.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next
instructions are you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
can't remove your
mask for any reason

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.727 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever until this is over.

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
times where you're

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:84%
going to want to rip it off
and see what's going on.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.824 align:middle line:90%
You've got to stay in darkness.

00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:42.407 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be in darkness
for almost a half an hour here.

00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I want your pineal gland
to start shutting down.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
That's partly why I'm also
spending 10 minutes going

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
to this other thing too.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So that you really start
getting calm inside.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:90%
So you can be sensitive.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.214 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.214 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, feel the Purana
tube and the Purana

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
coming from above, and below,
and meeting in your heart.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And feel that sphere.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And now, let's feel the
sphere of the Leonardo sphere,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
way out, the big one.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of that one
and feel the flow.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, again, take a deep breath.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you blow it out,
you might turn slightly

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
sideways so you don't blow
it into your partner's face.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But when you blow out,
see the white mist

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.586 align:middle line:90%
coming out of your mouth.

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And take another
breath, a deep breath,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:90%
and blow out the white mist.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And you see it or sense it or
feel it as it's coming out.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, see and feel that
the air you are breathing

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.882 align:middle line:84%
is connected to
everyone in this room.

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:90%
There is only one air mass.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And air that is in your
lungs is intimately

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.748 align:middle line:84%
connected with
everyone in this room.

00:04:20.748 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Further, see and feel that this
same air that is in your lungs

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.583 align:middle line:84%
is connected to all life on
Earth that is breathing air.

00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
See and feel that you
are a body in space.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And know that your body
is surrounded by space.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.698 align:middle line:90%
How is space different than air?

00:05:00.698 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Sense and feel that
space is like water.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.079 align:middle line:84%
In your imagination, sense the
tips of your fingers touching

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.578 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.374 align:middle line:84%
Now, sense space
touching your fingertips.

00:05:30.374 --> 00:05:35.182 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.182 --> 00:05:36.140 align:middle line:90%
What is the difference?

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
See and sense you are touching
the six directions of space,

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.914 align:middle line:84%
left, right, front,
back, up, and down.

00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, sense space touching
your six directions.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.982 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.982 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:90%
What is the difference?

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:84%
See and sense all
the extremities

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
of your body, your nose, ears,
fingers, toes, et cetera,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
becoming golden
and emitting light.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.845 align:middle line:84%
What is happening to
your body perception?

00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:84%
See and sense how the
inner space of your body

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and the outer space
around you interact.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.268 align:middle line:84%
In your imagination,
massage your right arm.

00:06:58.268 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.844 align:middle line:90%
Now, do it physically.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:90%
That's good enough.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
See yourself
floating in a 10-foot

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
or about a 4-meter
cube made of mirrors.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.484 align:middle line:84%
You can see your
body from any angle.

00:07:26.484 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And so as you begin
to move, see and sense

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
in each moment how your body
moves and changes as it moves

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.223 align:middle line:90%
inside this cube of mirrors.

00:07:43.223 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, back to just your
body in this room.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.292 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself two
dimensional and flat.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.946 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine yourself
four dimensional.

00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, back to your
third-dimensional body

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
in this room.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.095 align:middle line:84%
Find your center of
gravity within your body.

00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.306 align:middle line:90%
How do you visualize it?

00:08:33.306 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the center of
gravity, a movement appears.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.652 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:08:46.652 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, put your feet together
so they're touching.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
See and sense that by focusing
on the center of gravity,

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
small corrective movements
occur in the body.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.542 align:middle line:84%
Describe those
movements to yourself.

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.534 align:middle line:84%
Now, put your feet
shoulder distance apart.

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:37.721 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, see and sense and
imagine a plumb line

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
from your center
of gravity, which

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:84%
is like a string with
a heavy point on it,

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:90%
so it finds straight down.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
See and sense a plumb
line from your center

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.086 align:middle line:84%
of gravity, down through
to the center of the Earth.

00:10:02.086 --> 00:10:18.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Now without moving your feet,
move around in small circles,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
with the sense that
you are connected

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
Earth by this plumb line.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And feel this connection
to Mother Earth.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
In your imagination,
look at your nails

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:90%
and see their transparency.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And remember that you
were once completely

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
transparent in
your mother's womb.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.318 align:middle line:84%
We change with the
rhythms of time.

00:10:49.318 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.698 align:middle line:90%
Now, find your partner.

00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:59.406 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
begin the first dance.

00:10:59.406 --> 00:11:05.459 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And put your hands with
the figures facing up.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
When you're dancing,
you sense and feel

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
the movement of your body
as energy, not physical.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.972 align:middle line:84%
Try to think of yourself
as just pure energy.

00:11:25.972 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:84%
On this first dance,
move your hands

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
so only the fingertips
are touching, and very,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.714 align:middle line:90%
very lightly.

00:11:43.714 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of your Purana
tube and the Purana coming

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:84%
from above and below and meeting
in your heart and that sphere,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:84%
the small one that's super
concentrated with the Purana.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Send this Purana down both
arms from that sphere.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it goes down your
arm, into your palm,

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and across the gap, into
your partner's arms,

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:90%
down to about their elbows.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Now, feel that connection.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.336 align:middle line:84%
You've both interlinked
each other with that Purana.

00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:40.265 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:44.445 align:middle line:84%
Now, move your fingers apart
from each other a few inches.

00:12:44.445 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, feel that Purana
flowing between the palms

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:90%
of your hands and your fingers.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.985 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:10%
It can be very strong.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, put your
fingertips back where

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:90%
you're just lightly touching.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But don't so much
touch the fingertips

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.228 align:middle line:90%
as feel the Purana between you.

00:13:09.228 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
This first dance,
we're going to dance

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
just-- the only connection
you have primarily

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.270 align:middle line:84%
with your partner is your
fingertips and this Purana.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.968 align:middle line:84%
When you hear the
music, go for it.

00:13:23.968 --> 00:13:26.962 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:26.962 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, don't remove your mask.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Keep them on.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't take them off.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Especially don't remove your
mask on this next one for sure.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Go back to your hands facing up.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to feel that Purana
going down through your arms

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.640 align:middle line:90%
and into your partner.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And feel it coming
back from them.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.169 align:middle line:90%
You're mixing your Purana.

00:17:29.169 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And feel it coming
out of your palms.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, move your
hands so you're not

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:41.400 align:middle line:84%
touching your partner, an inch
or so away, maybe two inches.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But feel that Purana
because that's

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
going to be the only
connection you have.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.181 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:50.181 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Feel the Purana.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, one more thing.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.458 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the
space around your body.

00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:10.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.088 align:middle line:84%
Now, extend that space so
it surrounds your partner.

00:18:15.088 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So you become like an
egg-shaped-- or any shape

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
you want to make it.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But the space that contains
both of your bodies,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:90%
be aware of that space.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, become the
space around your two bodies.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
If you can maintain the
space and feel the Purana,

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:90%
you'll dance together.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you'll end up
on opposite ends of the room.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you lose your partner,
you can't cheat and find them

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.224 align:middle line:90%
by removing your mask.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.897 align:middle line:84%
You have to make whale calls
or something, dolphin clicks.

00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:15.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So the object is not
to lose your partner

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to
become very, very sensitive

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.255 align:middle line:90%
and feel them.

00:19:23.255 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Here we go, dance number two.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Remember to breathe.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:35.840 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.922 align:middle line:84%
Now, see if you can
find your partner.

00:23:38.922 --> 00:23:39.857 align:middle line:90%
Don't look.

00:23:39.857 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.770 align:middle line:84%
If you've lost your partner and
you don't know where they are,

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:90%
raise your hand.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:90%
So everybody has their partner.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.913 align:middle line:84%
My next question
is are you sure?

00:24:09.913 --> 00:24:12.328 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:12.328 --> 00:24:18.607 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.607 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you switched
partners, it's OK.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.338 align:middle line:90%
Here we go for the third dance.

00:24:25.338 --> 00:24:28.086 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.086 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:84%
On this one, again start
with your palms facing up

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and just get the
fingertips touching.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Feel the Purana
moving down your arms

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.375 align:middle line:84%
and connecting
with your partner.

00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, your body is mostly water.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine that this
water came out at your tummy

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and formed a big bubble in
front of you, a huge bubble.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And your partner formed
a big bubble of water

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.770 align:middle line:90%
in front of them.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And now these two
bubbles of water

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:84%
are mixed together
and connected.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you're connected
at your belly with water.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're
going to be water.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to feel
the connection at your belly

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:90%
with your partner.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water
from within your body

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:84%
coming out and forming a
big bubble in front of you

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
at your belly.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:90%
So it's like you're pregnant.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And your partner is going to
make a big bubble of water.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And those two bubbles, the
water is going to connect.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
connect with water.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:90%


00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So you're moving
your connection.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Even though you're slightly
touching your fingers--

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you're allowed to
touch your fingertips.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But the connection is at
your belly, with water.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Feel your movement from there.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.108 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:26:15.108 --> 00:26:16.605 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:16.605 --> 00:26:18.102 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.102 --> 00:26:20.597 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:20.597 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.500 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Give your partner a big hug.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And now you know if it's
your partner or not.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can take off your
masks if you want to.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:15.865 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.865 --> 00:32:16.365 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:16.365 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to do
another experiential thing.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to another
experiential thing.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:84%
But this time, it's
a little different.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's really fun.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.377 align:middle line:84%
And you can either use chairs,
or you can sit on the ground,

00:32:37.377 --> 00:32:38.710 align:middle line:90%
or you can do anything you want.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.786 align:middle line:84%
But if you want a chair,
you got to go get one.

00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:45.539 align:middle line:90%


00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And then soon as you
guys get settled down,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.910 align:middle line:84%
we'll do the next
experiential thing.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:55.510 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:90%
You freed yourself of chairs.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.218 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:32:58.218 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, here's what
we're going to do.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.265 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move your spirit
from one place in the body.

00:33:07.265 --> 00:33:10.352 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to move
it around in the body.

00:33:10.352 --> 00:33:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is
something that is kind

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.845 align:middle line:84%
of outside of most people's
experience, not everyone.

00:33:16.845 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's lots
of people here that go,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, of course,
I've astral projected

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.550 align:middle line:90%
all across the universe.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But even people who have
astral projected usually

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:84%
haven't moved inside of
their bodies very much.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:84%
They usually leave their
bodies and go somewhere

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.236 align:middle line:90%
or something of that nature.

00:33:35.236 --> 00:33:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to have you
moving inside of your body.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We're so used to being
in one place in our body

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that we reference
everything from that.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:90%
But imagine if you weren't here.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say
that you're up here

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.641 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking out through
your eyes, which is kind

00:33:53.641 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:90%
of what most of us are used to.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you are inside
the palm of your right hand.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:90%
What would your body feel?

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:10.639 align:middle line:84%
How would your body feel if you
were here, rather than here?

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:17.382 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you're in a big--
one of these modern hotels

00:34:17.382 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:84%
where they have the elevators
that are on the outside

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.380 align:middle line:90%
and you can see.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:27.429 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the top floor, like
this right now, we're up here,

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and you start going down,
it's almost like the building

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.090 align:middle line:90%
going up.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:37.902 align:middle line:84%
You change positions relative
to the different rooms

00:34:37.902 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:90%
in that hotel and everything.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.530 align:middle line:90%
You're changing positions.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.030 align:middle line:84%
If you go all the
way to the bottom,

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.920 align:middle line:84%
now you're looking
up at the building.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.960 align:middle line:84%
If you go all the way to the
top, you're looking down at it.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.469 align:middle line:90%
And it's same thing.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:84%
If you move from here,
over to your hand,

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.270 align:middle line:84%
your body is going
to be off-center.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be way over there.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
wherever your hand is.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's literally
what happens

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:90%
when you move around your body.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:84%
If you went down to
your feet, your body

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.370 align:middle line:84%
would be very different
than it is up here.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to get used
to that kind of movement.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Also we have been living--
for those of you that

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:84%
are inside your
pineal gland, you've

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.310 align:middle line:84%
been living inside of
a cage called a skull.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's really male.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.920 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.790 align:middle line:90%
It's constructed.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.400 align:middle line:90%
It's got structure.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And it feels different
than if you're

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.527 align:middle line:84%
inside a different
area of your body.

00:35:35.527 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
As you move to different
areas of your body,

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.300 align:middle line:84%
the sensation of being in
those areas is different.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I would just like
to try a real simple thing,

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.266 align:middle line:84%
just to go from here
to our throat chakra.

00:35:48.266 --> 00:35:49.015 align:middle line:90%
It's not very far.

00:35:49.015 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:90%
It's only a little ways.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But the experience
is really different.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Because this is so
solid and protected.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:90%
The throat is open and expanded.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.996 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing protecting it.

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And so you don't have that.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a different feeling.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So close your eyes and
imagine that you're

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.770 align:middle line:84%
a little, tiny sphere,
very small, even smaller

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:24.800 align:middle line:84%
than a marble, a little
tiny, tiny sphere.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:90%
And you're up inside your head.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And you know what it feels like.

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:31.810 align:middle line:90%
But feel that sensation.

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Kind of be aware that you're
in a skull and what that feels

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.550 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And now with your intention,
let go of that place.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And see or sense or feel
yourself going down your throat

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.922 align:middle line:90%
and down to your throat chakra.

00:36:47.922 --> 00:36:51.440 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.700 align:middle line:90%
And when you get there, stop.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to look up
from that little, tiny sphere,

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:09.000 align:middle line:84%
you see your head way above you
and your body's down below you.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But feel the
difference of what it's

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:17.050 align:middle line:84%
like to be in your throat
chakra, rather than your head.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:90%
It's open.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.718 align:middle line:90%
It's a different feeling.

00:37:20.718 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.676 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to leave
you for a moment to feel it.

00:37:26.676 --> 00:37:38.870 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:39.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go back.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.205 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to let go of that
place of the throat chakra.

00:37:44.205 --> 00:37:48.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to let go of it because
we tend to clamp onto things.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the throat.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And now go back up.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself
moving, going back up

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.645 align:middle line:90%
into the center of your head.

00:37:55.645 --> 00:37:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
there, now feel what

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.279 align:middle line:84%
it feels like to be
inside that skull again,

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:04.070 align:middle line:84%
which is different than
your throat chakra.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.640 align:middle line:90%


00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Only when you leave it, can
you feel it when you come back.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And my first question is,
who could not do that?

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.692 align:middle line:90%


00:38:23.692 --> 00:38:25.165 align:middle line:90%
>>It's imaginative when I do it.

00:38:25.165 --> 00:38:26.044 align:middle line:90%
I'm just imaging.

00:38:26.044 --> 00:38:27.043 align:middle line:90%
>>You're just imagining.

00:38:27.043 --> 00:38:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>But the difference between
imagination and reality

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.563 align:middle line:90%
is so thin.

00:38:32.563 --> 00:38:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.340 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.896 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said that imagination
was more important than-- what

00:38:42.896 --> 00:38:43.770 align:middle line:90%
was the word he used?

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Knowledge.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Than knowledge.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:84%
But how did Einstein
achieve his knowledge?

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It was almost always
through imagination.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:90%
That's why he felt that way.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.030 align:middle line:84%
He was also, when they
bisected his brain afterwards,

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.330 align:middle line:84%
he had the largest area
39 on the right side

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.970 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, which is where
your imagination came from,

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:05.475 align:middle line:90%
they've ever found.

00:39:05.475 --> 00:39:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they have since then.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:90%
But he has a huge imagination.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.278 align:middle line:84%
And just to show you this
thing between imagination

00:39:14.278 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge, he
discovered that light

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:24.620 align:middle line:84%
was affected by gravity,
purely through imagination.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he wasn't a very
good mathematician,

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.580 align:middle line:90%
a poor mathematician.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But he had a
fantastic imagination.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:38.060 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.400 align:middle line:90%
He saw an elevator.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
if there's a hole

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:47.160 align:middle line:84%
in the side, a little hole, and
they shined a light through it,

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.590 align:middle line:84%
then the light would
go to the other side.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But if the elevator
was going up,

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:84%
once the light entered here,
it takes time for the light

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.940 align:middle line:90%
to get over to the other side.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the elevator would
go up and the light beam

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.010 align:middle line:90%
would strike lower.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So he said that an
elevator, when it goes up,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.700 align:middle line:90%
increases your weight.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It's like gravity.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And the light beam
would strike lower.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So he said to
himself immediately,

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:84%
light's affected by gravity,
using just a simple imagination

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.690 align:middle line:90%
thing like that.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Then he took it over to a
more scientific level, where

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:27.610 align:middle line:84%
he said there's going
to be a solar eclipse

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:28.690 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And they know it would be
right beside a certain star

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and that light from that
star would pass right

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.470 align:middle line:90%
by the surface of the Sun.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And if it was not
affected by it,

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.440 align:middle line:84%
it would strike a photographic
plate at a very specific point.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But if it was affected
by it, it would

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.342 align:middle line:84%
be bend, just like it
did in the elevator,

00:40:48.342 --> 00:40:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and come over and strike
the photographic plate

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:90%
at a different place.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And they would then be able to
prove that the light traveling

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.310 align:middle line:84%
from that star, as it
went by the Sun, was bent

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.110 align:middle line:90%
and moved over here.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.970 align:middle line:84%
He was able to demonstrate that
light is affected by gravity.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And this was all generated
through imagination.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And really, the way
the world is, of what

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.540 align:middle line:90%
it is, it's just images.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.310 align:middle line:90%
And images are imaging.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Imagination is
really, really close.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when you imagine things
going on inside of yourself,

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.670 align:middle line:84%
there is very subtle
differences between those two.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would like to do another
movement inside the body,

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:44.140 align:middle line:90%
a little more distance.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about this thing

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.190 align:middle line:84%
about seeing from your
hands or your feet.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.477 align:middle line:90%
The superpsychic kids can see.

00:41:52.477 --> 00:41:53.935 align:middle line:84%
They've only picked
certain places.

00:41:53.935 --> 00:41:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why only certain

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:84%
places because it doesn't
really matter that I can see.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.564 align:middle line:90%
But they see with their ears.

00:42:01.564 --> 00:42:03.730 align:middle line:84%
That was the first one who
could see was their ears.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.900 align:middle line:84%
The first Chinese
kid in 1974 was

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:84%
able to see as
well with his ears

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.580 align:middle line:90%
as you can see with your eyes.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they found
ones that could

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.350 align:middle line:90%
see underneath their eyes.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:90%
They could see with their hair.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.262 align:middle line:84%
They could see
with their armpits.

00:42:18.262 --> 00:42:20.206 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:20.206 --> 00:42:24.590 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.320 align:middle line:90%
They could see with their hands.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.500 align:middle line:90%
They could see with their feet.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, different places.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.370 align:middle line:84%
They could see with their
mouth and with the tip

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of their tongue.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And they actually can see
better than these eyes.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Because they could not
only see what you see,

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.250 align:middle line:84%
but they can tell you anything
about what they're seeing,

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:84%
anything at all,
absolutely anything.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.402 align:middle line:84%
And so right now, I'm going
to see how many people can--

00:42:53.402 --> 00:42:54.610 align:middle line:90%
we're going to do this thing.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But as a side thing,
we're going to see

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.030 align:middle line:90%
if you can see with your hands.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And once you get it and
you can do it, it's yours.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.512 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
continually get better.

00:43:05.512 --> 00:43:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can just
go around a corner

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:08.932 align:middle line:90%
and stick your hand there.

00:43:08.932 --> 00:43:10.896 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:10.896 --> 00:43:16.800 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.411 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:43:17.411 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:90%


00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to
do and I'll describe it.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have you go
from here to your throat.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
go from the throat

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:84%
down and over to
the right shoulder.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to go down
here, through the elbow

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.512 align:middle line:90%
and down into the palm.

00:43:37.512 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:84%
When you get to
the palm, I'm going

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.130 align:middle line:84%
to have you look
at your fingers.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.338 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to realize
you're really little when

00:43:42.338 --> 00:43:43.470 align:middle line:90%
you're doing this.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.440 align:middle line:84%
You've concentrated
yourself into just

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.130 align:middle line:90%
like a little, tiny place.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And you look up at your
fingers and they look huge.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.727 align:middle line:90%
They look really, really big.

00:43:52.727 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to see them
and wiggle your fingers

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and see them moving, which
is kind of interesting

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:90%
when you do that.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And then after you
do that, you're

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be sitting there
wiggling your fingers.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to say,
turn your hand to your face,

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:07.520 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Even though you've got your mask
on and your eyes are closed,

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:84%
you can turn your
hand to your face.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And you literally turn
away from the fingers

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and look out from there.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.830 align:middle line:90%
And you could see your face.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you see from
your consciousness.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can see anything,
no matter where you are.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.261 align:middle line:84%
If you're astral projecting,
you can see also.

00:44:31.261 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
your eyes either.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:90%
But you can still see.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.480 align:middle line:90%
But you can see.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'll bet you,
we'll get at least 30,

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:41.950 align:middle line:84%
35 people in here that suddenly
can see with their hands.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:44.260 align:middle line:90%
And so we're going to do that.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to look
at yourself, which is

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.835 align:middle line:90%
an interesting thing for sure.

00:44:48.835 --> 00:44:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And then after
that, if you want,

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.918 align:middle line:84%
you can just stick
your hand up and start

00:44:51.918 --> 00:44:55.489 align:middle line:84%
looking around the room,
which is kind of fun.

00:44:55.489 --> 00:44:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to bring
you back, up the same way

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.340 align:middle line:90%
you came, and back up here.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.580 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll talk about it.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:02.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:03.645 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:45:03.645 --> 00:45:04.395 align:middle line:90%
Start your motors.

00:45:04.395 --> 00:45:22.800 align:middle line:90%


00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, feel your connection to
your Merkaba first, the flow,

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.590 align:middle line:90%
and the sphere of Purana.

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:33.290 align:middle line:90%


00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And also for this one,
be aware of the angel

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.220 align:middle line:90%
that you met on the first day.

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Just be conscious.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Feel them.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:48.222 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.222 --> 00:45:50.724 align:middle line:90%
Now, feel the skull around you.

00:45:50.724 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.815 align:middle line:84%
Be aware to how
it's a containment.

00:45:55.815 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, let go of that.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have to literally
let go with your intention.

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.896 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself moving
down your throat chakra.

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:08.410 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
When you get your throat
chakra, stop for just a moment.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.834 align:middle line:84%
And feel the openness there
again for a second time.

00:46:16.834 --> 00:46:26.310 align:middle line:90%


00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, let go of that
space, that throat chakra.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Just let go of it.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself moving
down a little bit further.

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:36.200 align:middle line:90%
And turn and go to your right.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And go over to
your right shoulder

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:90%
and stop there for a moment.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.070 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, at your right shoulder,
turn around and look back.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And feel and sense or see your
body, how you're off-angle.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.510 align:middle line:90%
It's off to one side.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Your head is a little higher.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Your body is off.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a different positioning
than you're usually used to.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:07.212 align:middle line:90%


00:47:07.212 --> 00:47:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, turn back again.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And just like you're flying,
look where you're going.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And go down your arm and feel
yourself moving down your arm

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and down to your elbow,
turning a little bit maybe.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And continuing, going over
until you get to your wrist

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:30.170 align:middle line:90%
and then into the palm of hand.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, look up and
see your fingers.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly
move your fingers

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:36.830 align:middle line:90%
or wiggle them a little bit.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.118 align:middle line:84%
And look and see
your fingers moving.

00:47:40.118 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And get used to the feel
of seeing your own hand,

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.380 align:middle line:90%
your fingers of your hand.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, put your hand
up to your face

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.790 align:middle line:90%
or turn it toward your face.

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And look at your own self.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:08.990 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And see your face.

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:13.010 align:middle line:90%
If you can, you can.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.240 align:middle line:90%
And if you can't, you can't.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But you can if you
will allow yourself.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're
looking at yourself,

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.050 align:middle line:84%
realize that you can
look at anything.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:30.030 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, for those of
you that can see your face,

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.770 align:middle line:84%
you could turn it down to a
newspaper and start reading it.

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Or a magazine, you
can actually see it.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to,
turn your hand up

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.750 align:middle line:90%
and look around the room.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
see around the room.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.510 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing it in a
slightly different way

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:90%
than you would with your eyes.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.090 align:middle line:90%
But you're seeing.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:49:09.564 align:middle line:90%


00:49:09.564 --> 00:49:11.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing this
for the first time,

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:12.438 align:middle line:90%
it's usually pretty exciting.

00:49:12.438 --> 00:49:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, drop your hand back down
and relax it for that way.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And now, look up again, turn
around, and see your fingers

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.140 align:middle line:90%
again just one more time.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.900 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And then turn and let's go back.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself going into
your wrist and up your arm,

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.270 align:middle line:84%
turning a little
bit at the elbow

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and going up to
your right shoulder.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, one more time.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Look at your body, what it feels
like from the right shoulder.

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:03.476 align:middle line:90%
It's off-center.

00:50:03.476 --> 00:50:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.036 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:50:08.036 --> 00:50:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, continue.

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:12.810 align:middle line:84%
From there, let go
of the shoulder.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And keep moving up to
your throat chakra.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the throat
chakra, let go of that place

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and go all the way up to
your neck, into your head.

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:31.575 align:middle line:84%
Now, feel the skull and
being in that space.

00:50:31.575 --> 00:50:33.208 align:middle line:90%
It's a very distinct feeling.

00:50:33.208 --> 00:50:37.590 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And make sure you turn so you're
looking at where your eyes are.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And then take off your masks.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:51.698 align:middle line:90%


00:50:51.698 --> 00:50:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Am I supposed to not feel--
I mean I though my fingers

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:54.940 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean when my eyes close and
I touch my fingers together,

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I still felt all this, all my
nerve endings on the outside.

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.200 align:middle line:10%
When you say I'm in my mind and
feel that you are in your mind,

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.430 align:middle line:10%
I still felt all this though.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to let go of that.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to let go of it.

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:15.690 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about that he
could still feel his body, OK.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when I had
you flying the other day?

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.200 align:middle line:90%
You were flying around.

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And the school asked
if you would also

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.760 align:middle line:84%
be aware of your body while
you were flying around,

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.642 align:middle line:84%
purposely wanting to feel
your body, as well as flying?

00:51:30.642 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:90%
You can do both at once.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you're doing
these kinds of things,

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:38.526 align:middle line:84%
it's OK to be aware of your
body, or any discomfort,

00:51:38.526 --> 00:51:39.650 align:middle line:90%
or anything else like that.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.370 align:middle line:84%
If you feel discomfort, you
just change your position.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:45.110 align:middle line:90%
But that shouldn't stop you.

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:47.457 align:middle line:90%
This is a separate thing.

00:51:47.457 --> 00:51:51.194 align:middle line:84%
And your body sensations
and everything

00:51:51.194 --> 00:51:52.360 align:middle line:90%
are still going to be there.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.050 align:middle line:84%
If you leave your body and
go literally out of your body

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and out of your
sphere, away, you

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.070 align:middle line:90%
won't feel your body anymore.

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:03.740 align:middle line:84%
You won't even
know you have one.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be
totally free of it.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:06.934 align:middle line:90%
You're still connected to it.

00:52:06.934 --> 00:52:08.100 align:middle line:90%
And you can come back to it.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But you'll be
totally free of it.

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.990 align:middle line:84%
But as long as
you're in your body

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:14.246 align:middle line:84%
and doing the kind of
things we're talking about,

00:52:14.246 --> 00:52:16.120 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be really
aware of your body.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.030 align:middle line:90%


00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:21.485 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:21.485 --> 00:52:21.985 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm sorry.

00:52:21.985 --> 00:52:23.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm Mary.

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>I have a question.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that can call to you?

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.460 align:middle line:84%
That you can
connect with and you

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.700 align:middle line:84%
can see all of these
things, and hear

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:40.410 align:middle line:84%
conversations, and everything
that's going on somewhere else?

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, sure.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:44.725 align:middle line:90%
>>What is it that can call?

00:52:44.725 --> 00:52:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean call, as
ask, pulling you to it?

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, well, that
could be varied.

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean it could be--

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>When my mom was in the
hospital in Arkansas and I was

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.310 align:middle line:90%
in California,--

00:52:59.310 --> 00:52:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>--I saw everything there.

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And I heard conversations, and
the nurses, and all of that.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't think it was real.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.820 align:middle line:90%
But it was real.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>You can prove these things.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:19.000 align:middle line:84%
When I was studying
this a long time ago,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.750 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, we did
things to prove it.

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:27.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you what
they call astral

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:33.460 align:middle line:84%
project out of your
body, I was doing things.

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Like I would have my
wife go into another room

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.239 align:middle line:90%
and set cards on that table.

00:53:39.239 --> 00:53:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
leave my body and go

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.250 align:middle line:84%
see what they were and come
back and write them down.

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:45.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was right.

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.780 align:middle line:90%
But I was still not convinced.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember we did
all kinds of things.

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I did, I
finally would leave my body

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and I went down to
the local library

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and pulled a book off
the shelf that I'd never

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:02.320 align:middle line:84%
seen before and memorized
the ISBN number and then

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.010 align:middle line:90%
name of the book.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:90%
And then came back to my body.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Went down to the library and
the book was really there.

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And it really was
the ISBN number.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.681 align:middle line:90%
It was very convincing.

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:15.030 align:middle line:90%


00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So you have to mix reality
with this other level

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:24.160 align:middle line:90%
of our potential.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the
place after a while

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:31.150 align:middle line:84%
where you know that you can
tell the difference between when

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:35.150 align:middle line:84%
you're just imagining
something and when it's real.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say for sure your
experience was real or not.

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But I've had so many
experiences like this

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:45.427 align:middle line:90%
that now I can tell usually.

00:54:45.427 --> 00:54:46.760 align:middle line:90%
I might make mistakes sometimes.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.960 align:middle line:90%
But usually I can tell.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.500 --> 00:55:00.970 align:middle line:10%
>>If you have something like
an out-of-body experience,

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:05.700 align:middle line:10%
do you think our body could be
occupied with another entity?

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no danger?

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not like using
drugs and things.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Basically you're on drugs,
you just invite them in.

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:16.160 align:middle line:90%
You just let them come in.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.930 align:middle line:90%
You don't care.

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:20.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a natural defense
in the human body.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And the natural defense
will not allow it.

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.980 align:middle line:84%
If you use your
Merkaba field, which

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I've asked you to block
the possibility of that,

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.440 align:middle line:84%
there's absolutely not
even a chance of it.

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.971 align:middle line:84%
>>So do we have to give
intent for protection or no?

00:55:36.971 --> 00:55:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Do you have to--

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Don't use it, I mean.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.503 align:middle line:90%
>>Do you have to use what?

00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Intention.

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yeah.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, naturally, no.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But like we have
a natural defense

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:90%
against that kind of thing.

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But under certain
conditions, with drugs,

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and there are other
things besides drugs

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:03.357 align:middle line:84%
that they can do it,
we basically say--

00:56:03.357 --> 00:56:04.940 align:middle line:84%
somebody comes and
says, can I get in?

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.398 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
saying, yeah, sure.

00:56:06.398 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:90%
We don't care.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.600 align:middle line:90%
And you let it.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just
a normal person

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and you are leaving your
body in this kind of way,

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:18.110 align:middle line:84%
your body is totally
protected while it's gone.

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:24.070 align:middle line:84%
But there are always
exceptions in the sense

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that you may allow
it for some reason.

00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.675 align:middle line:90%


00:56:34.675 --> 00:56:37.410 align:middle line:90%
There are no fixed laws hardly.

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:39.105 align:middle line:84%
There's exceptions
to almost everything.

00:56:39.105 --> 00:56:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard for me to say
absolutely yes, for sure.

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I know under certain
conditions and certain things,

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:50.100 align:middle line:84%
things may be a
little different.

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But generally, no, you don't
have to worry about it.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.800 align:middle line:90%
But I can say one thing.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.840 align:middle line:84%
If you put the intention
into your Merkaba field

00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to block anyone from coming into
your body or even your field--

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I block the whole field
when it comes to that.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So that any kinds of these
entities or any of the living

00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:14.890 align:middle line:84%
beings or anything else that are
out there that want to come in,

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:17.510 align:middle line:84%
they can't come in
without permission.

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.190 align:middle line:90%
If you do that, it's absolute.

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
created the universe,

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.630 align:middle line:84%
we created it through
the geometries

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:26.150 align:middle line:90%
of the Merkaba field.

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And the Merkaba field was
the doorway in and out.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So that when you
create a universe,

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.190 align:middle line:84%
you want to go in
and experience it.

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But you want to make sure that
you can get back out of there

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.840 align:middle line:90%
and you haven't created a trap.

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what the
knowledge of the creation fields

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:49.526 align:middle line:84%
and through the Merkaba,
what we're doing here.

00:57:49.526 --> 00:57:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Once it's programmed
that you're not

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.610 align:middle line:84%
allowing anyone
else to use this,

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:03.960 align:middle line:90%
for example, then it's absolute.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no person on
earth or in existence,

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:10.330 align:middle line:84%
no matter how intelligent
or how powerful they are

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:14.050 align:middle line:84%
or who they are, they
still can't do it.

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was created that way on
purpose, that when you come in,

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:20.530 align:middle line:90%
you could always go out.

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:26.010 align:middle line:90%


00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:30.865 align:middle line:84%
>>I have the feeling that
every time I kind of imagine

00:58:30.865 --> 00:58:35.720 align:middle line:84%
it myself and I want to think
that I'm imagining myself

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.930 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not really doing it.

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:39.054 align:middle line:84%
I'm just totally
back in my head.

00:58:39.054 --> 00:58:41.970 align:middle line:90%


00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>I know.

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:46.336 align:middle line:84%
It takes a long time
to know the difference.

00:58:46.336 --> 00:58:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Over a long time, you
can tell the difference

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:50.086 align:middle line:84%
when something is
just imagination

00:58:50.086 --> 00:58:51.210 align:middle line:90%
or if you're actually real.

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:54.930 align:middle line:90%


00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:57.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to say it.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:02.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- the only way I can
do it is through experiences

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I've had.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.800 align:middle line:90%


00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Let me give this one.

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I was once asked
by-- I mentioned

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that I went to the
Navajo and they took us

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:21.632 align:middle line:90%
into Antelope Canyon.

00:59:21.632 --> 00:59:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I talked about
the snake on the side,

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and the guy that was blind,
and all that stuff like that.

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:32.880 align:middle line:84%
After I did that and we got
back and he dropped us all off,

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.140 align:middle line:84%
then we went on to the thing,
to the rest of this journey.

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up at
the Grand Canyon,

00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:41.820 align:middle line:90%
on the rim of the Grand Canyon.

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was about to do a
ceremony, a very old ceremony,

00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:50.309 align:middle line:90%
having to do with grandmothers.

00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:52.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
the ceremony was too much.

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But we were about
to do a ceremony.

00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:57.096 align:middle line:84%
And I went out into the
forest by myself-- actually

00:59:57.096 --> 00:59:58.220 align:middle line:90%
there was two other people.

00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:58.761 align:middle line:90%
They came in.

00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked them
to go get something.

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And while they were
gone, I was by myself.

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:07.190 align:middle line:90%
And I was setting everything up.

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And this person-- again, I
don't want to mention his name.

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But the Navajo shaman
that was blind,

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.880 align:middle line:84%
he appeared to me,
in front of me.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he didn't like
the idea of a white man doing

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.160 align:middle line:90%
indigenous people's ceremonies.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said he didn't think
that I had the right to do that.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, well, I am
indigenous from my last life.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have permission
to do this.

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And we went through this
whole thing on that.

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, OK, if
it's true that you really

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.970 align:middle line:84%
are who you say you are
and that you have the right

01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to do this, then the moment
that you begin this ceremony,

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I want lightning to come out
of the sky and strike right

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:06.770 align:middle line:90%
a few feet away from here.

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And if that happens,
then I will believe you.

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:14.460 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, OK.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:16.980 align:middle line:90%


01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
So is this imagination going on?

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:22.500 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.414 align:middle line:90%
So all the people called in.

01:01:25.414 --> 01:01:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Everything was set up.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
The grandmother
was sitting there.

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:30.860 align:middle line:90%
It was a gift ceremony.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.280 align:middle line:90%
And the first person came up.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And we were all ready to go.

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:38.060 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, let's begin.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.776 align:middle line:84%
And the grandmother
said a couple words.

01:01:39.776 --> 01:01:43.090 align:middle line:90%


01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The guy took his object
that he was giving away

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:47.646 align:middle line:84%
and he started to hand
it to the grandmother.

01:01:47.646 --> 01:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And lightning came
out of the sky

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and struck the ground
about 75 feet away.

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It just blew a hole about six
feet around in the ground.

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Practically everybody bounced
off the ground, like this.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And everybody started screaming
and everything else like that.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:00.708 align:middle line:90%
And I started laughing.

01:02:00.708 --> 01:02:01.780 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't help it.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.580 align:middle line:90%


01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And so during that ceremony
when we were in Antelope Canyon,

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:20.570 align:middle line:90%
this shaman borrowed my rattle.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And borrowed a rattle, which was
from another indigenous person

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
that happened to
be in that tribe.

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And he sang the peyote
songs using that rattle.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And so right after
the lightning struck,

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
he appeared, not to me, but to
this other indigenous person.

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And told her to go to me
right after the ceremony

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and give me the
rattle and say to me

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that he accepts that who I am
or my relationship with him.

01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I've got a very close
relationship now.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And so this other
indigenous person,

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that didn't know any of
this stuff, came up and says

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
this shaman came to me and
said I'm supposed to give you

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.850 align:middle line:90%
the rattle and here it is.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, is this imagination?

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a fine
line between these things.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And you need to get sensitivity
because there is another world.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:29.020 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:29.820 align:middle line:90%
We're connected.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
We are not separate
from the outer reality.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.350 align:middle line:84%
The outer reality, we're
intimately connected with it.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And once you know it, and you
know what that feeling is,

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and what it all is,
and the relationships

01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
of it, what feels like
imagination can become real.

01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:51.390 align:middle line:90%
And so it just takes time.

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:54.670 align:middle line:90%


01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing I
can do to convince you.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that
has to develop slowly

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
over time within
you, until you can

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
see that we are much
more than we know we are.

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
We're a lot more
than we know we are.

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And you have to trust it.

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:18.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:21.960 align:middle line:90%


01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.185 align:middle line:90%
Let's go further.

01:04:24.185 --> 01:04:28.180 align:middle line:90%


01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.765 align:middle line:90%
Put on your mask one more time.

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to go this
time to your heart.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to go into
the sacred space of the heart.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
That takes a little
bit more understanding.

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to go to the heart
itself, the physical heart.

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And all we're going to do is
go inside of it somewhere.

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
you to feel what it

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
feels like to be in the
heart relative to what it

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.820 align:middle line:90%
feels like to be in the brain.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
They're really,
really different.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.840 align:middle line:90%
The brain is really male.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.440 align:middle line:90%
The heart is really female.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we go.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Again, feel your Purana field.

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Feel your sphere of Purana.

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Breathe.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Center yourself.

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Feel the skull for a moment,
again that feeling of what

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:22.540 align:middle line:90%
it's like to be in there.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Now let go of that and go
down to your throat chakra.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And stop there
for just a moment.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400 align:middle line:90%
This is your third time.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's starting
to get familiar.

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And now let go of your heart
and feel yourself going down

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
inside your chest
and your cavity.

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And keep moving until you
can see, or sense, or feel

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.068 align:middle line:84%
your physical heart
right in front of you.

01:05:49.068 --> 01:05:51.820 align:middle line:90%


01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, stop
for a moment and just

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.791 align:middle line:90%
see it right there.

01:05:56.791 --> 01:05:57.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:57.290 --> 01:06:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, go right through
the membrane of the heart

01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and go inside,
somewhere in the middle

01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:06.240 align:middle line:90%
or in the center of your heart.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And now, feel what it
feels like to be in there.

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:14.825 align:middle line:84%
It's a very female,
curvy, soft place.

01:06:14.825 --> 01:06:15.547 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

01:06:15.547 --> 01:06:19.130 align:middle line:90%


01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at your body,
your head is way up there

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:25.830 align:middle line:90%
and you're slightly off-center.

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:29.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a different location.

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But I'm primarily getting you
to feel what it feels like just

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to be in the heart, which
is different than anywhere

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:41.610 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:47.211 align:middle line:90%


01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:49.934 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the
heart all around you.

01:06:49.934 --> 01:06:58.330 align:middle line:90%


01:06:58.330 --> 01:06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:06:58.830 --> 01:06:59.704 align:middle line:90%
Now, let go.

01:06:59.704 --> 01:07:00.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of hard.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like hugging
someone when you just

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:05.130 align:middle line:90%
realized they're sacred.

01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Let go of your heart
and turn and go

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
through the membrane of your
heart and move back up, up, up,

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:15.922 align:middle line:84%
until you come to
your throat chakra.

01:07:15.922 --> 01:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And just wait there for a
moment, because we all move

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:19.338 align:middle line:90%
at slightly different speeds.

01:07:19.338 --> 01:07:25.650 align:middle line:90%


01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:26.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, let go of the throat
chakra and move all the way up

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:32.650 align:middle line:90%
inside your brain.

01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And one more time, feel
the skull, how different

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:40.480 align:middle line:90%
that is than the heart.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not contained.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:44.528 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is contained,
where the heart is just open.

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:49.470 align:middle line:90%


01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:50.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.794 align:middle line:90%
Take off your masks now.

01:07:51.794 --> 01:07:59.950 align:middle line:90%


01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.454 align:middle line:90%
Could everybody do that?

01:08:02.454 --> 01:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Is there anybody that
could not do that?

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.270 align:middle line:90%


01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:08.385 align:middle line:90%
I have to look.

01:08:08.385 --> 01:08:11.541 align:middle line:84%
I have to shade my
eyes to be able to see.

01:08:11.541 --> 01:08:12.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040 align:middle line:90%
So everybody could do that.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:13.539 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:08:13.539 --> 01:08:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
This last little thing is
that there's different ways

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.889 align:middle line:90%
of getting into the heart.

01:08:17.889 --> 01:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And I want to describe
these different ways

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and then tell you which
way we're going to use.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The Kogi way was
the one I mentioned.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.619 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned it here I
think a long time ago.

01:08:28.619 --> 01:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.846 align:middle line:84%
I've done this
workshop so many times.

01:08:30.846 --> 01:08:33.689 align:middle line:90%


01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:37.010 align:middle line:84%
When I left the Kogi
and they found out

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that I was going
to do this, which

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.670 align:middle line:84%
they didn't think that
human beings would

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
be able to do this.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.519 align:middle line:84%
They really didn't,
not initially.

01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why they told
me just go to animals.

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:47.090 align:middle line:90%
It's much easier.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.770 align:middle line:90%


01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:51.609 align:middle line:84%
And when I told them
that I was going

01:08:51.609 --> 01:08:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to teach human beings
this, they said, well, OK.

01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:57.819 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's how you do it.

01:08:57.819 --> 01:08:59.414 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me
their instructions.

01:08:59.414 --> 01:09:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
figured, well, there's

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
nobody-- I told you they
want you to stand up

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
in a totally dark space,
where there's no light,

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.170 align:middle line:90%
not even one photon coming in.

01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:11.069 align:middle line:90%
And you do this little dance.

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:13.220 align:middle line:84%
You just keep moving,
kind of like this.

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
If you watch them, they just
keep moving from one leg

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.560 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And they just keep moving
around and doing this.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're to do that dance
for nine days and nine nights

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:33.050 align:middle line:84%
without any food,
or water, or sleep.

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:36.367 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I told
them, I says, you know,

01:09:36.367 --> 01:09:38.284 align:middle line:90%
you don't know who we are.

01:09:38.284 --> 01:09:40.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't think
you have any idea.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And they really didn't--
they didn't know who we were.

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:45.950 align:middle line:90%
We were like aliens.

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:47.290 align:middle line:90%
We like ETs on the planet.

01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Because even when I brought
the Kogi here to Sedona,

01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the old
Mamos-- and he's here.

01:09:56.430 --> 01:10:00.010 align:middle line:84%
He's got-- I don't know
how many people were there.

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:00.565 align:middle line:90%
It was lots.

01:10:00.565 --> 01:10:01.777 align:middle line:90%
It was really lots.

01:10:01.777 --> 01:10:04.510 align:middle line:90%


01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And first thing he
says is how come you

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:13.445 align:middle line:84%
guys are so stupid that you
would kill your own planet?

01:10:13.445 --> 01:10:16.300 align:middle line:90%


01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Who are you that you're
so stupid that you

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
would kill the very
thing that-- your mother

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:22.730 align:middle line:90%
that keeps you alive?

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean because they
just don't get it.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.640 align:middle line:84%
They just don't understand
how anybody would even

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
have anything in you that
would do that, anywhere.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with them.

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Why would we do this?

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:37.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just crazy.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.530 align:middle line:90%
But we are.

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:42.062 align:middle line:84%
We're unconsciously
and consciously,

01:10:42.062 --> 01:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the stuff,
it's just pure greed.

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:44.560 align:middle line:90%
We don't care.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It's tear down a park
and build a parking

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.960 align:middle line:90%
lot, that whole thing.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.010 align:middle line:90%
It's why would we do this?

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:58.370 align:middle line:90%
So he was very upset with us.

01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you
another little story

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.730 align:middle line:90%
that they told me at one point.

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:05.440 align:middle line:90%
There was four of them.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we need
to get out of here.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.910 align:middle line:84%
That's basically it,
in so many words.

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Can you take us into
nature somewhere?

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said sure.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So I took him way up
in a canyon that I

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.840 align:middle line:84%
know, that's kind of secret
and hidden, and sat there.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And they were so much happier.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
sitting around

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:32.020 align:middle line:90%
and singing songs and things.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And then at one
point, a little bird

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.655 align:middle line:84%
came and landed on
one of the Mamos.

01:11:37.655 --> 01:11:38.820 align:middle line:90%
He looks over at the bird.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And the bird goes, chirp, chirp,
chirp, chirp, chirp, like that.

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, the bird
just says that we got

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.197 align:middle line:90%
to get out of here tomorrow.

01:11:46.197 --> 01:11:48.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Really?

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said this whole
thing is going to get weird.

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:55.077 align:middle line:90%
So we better leave.

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And the bird goes
chirp, chirp, chirp.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.993 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yeah, he's serious.

01:11:57.993 --> 01:12:00.640 align:middle line:90%
So we got to go.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.520 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.061 align:middle line:84%
They left first
thing in the morning.

01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And that afternoon
was when the ceremony

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that the people were doing just
went insane and went crazy.

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.326 align:middle line:84%
And I saw exactly
what they were doing.

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:14.810 align:middle line:90%


01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:18.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one time
I was in Guatemala.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And one of the Kogi was there.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.170 align:middle line:90%
There was actually four of them.

01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:28.890 align:middle line:90%
But one was Kogi Mamos.

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:32.930 align:middle line:90%
And he was sitting there.

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him--
he was actually

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:37.090 align:middle line:90%
on film when he said this.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I asked him-- I was
interviewing them

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and I said-- because we thought
they came for the ceremony

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:48.550 align:middle line:90%
that the Mayans were doing.

01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And that was the thing.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him though--
the other one said yes.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.447 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, why
did you come here?

01:12:55.447 --> 01:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, I didn't
have anything to do with that.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, why did you come here?

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I came
here to see you.

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, what did you
want to see me for?

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, when we
were down in the Kogi land,

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.910 align:middle line:84%
we were sitting
there and lightning

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
came across the sky from the
north and then from the south.

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And it met in the
sky and exploded.

01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And the thunder talked
to us and told us

01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:24.130 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to be up
here in Guatemala on this time.

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:28.520 align:middle line:90%
And we wanted to talk to you.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.405 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I'm here.

01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:31.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.200 align:middle line:90%


01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's another world.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Because all this external
stuff is inside of you.

01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not external to you.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.630 align:middle line:90%
You are the creator of it.

01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you really
understand that everything

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.307 align:middle line:84%
is alive and breathing,
it's another world.

01:13:49.307 --> 01:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we think
everything's dead.

01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We think the Earth is a big
rock floating through space.

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:56.265 align:middle line:90%
She is not a rock.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.140 align:middle line:90%
That's just her body.

01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:00.670 align:middle line:90%


01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Kogi way of
doing this is not

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:08.390 align:middle line:84%
going to work because we
can't stand up for nine days

01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:10.580 align:middle line:90%
if our life depended on it.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So I had to figure
out some other way.

01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the first way we did
it-- I'm just telling you

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
these different ways
so that if you ever

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:26.630 align:middle line:84%
want to continue this
exploration yourself,

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
you can at least
see where I've been.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.640 align:middle line:90%
This was the first way we chose.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
When I was thinking about it,
well, how do I get in there?

01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
At HeartMath at Stanford,
they discovered this field.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And they also knew
that the field

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
was generated by the heart,
not by something else.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, I intuited that
what was actually

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
generating this was the
sacred space of the heart.

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And now they agree with
that now at this point.

01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I use this.

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.510 align:middle line:84%
What I could see was--
see, there's a big one

01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:57.759 align:middle line:90%
and then there's a little one.

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, the little one
is right around here.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's right around the heart.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'd get people to
go, leave the brain,

01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:07.790 align:middle line:84%
go down, and go over to
the heart, see where it is.

01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And then go straight
up, following

01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
the lines of the tortial
field up to where that.

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you get above it and
you're in the psychic realm,

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:18.400 align:middle line:90%
you can see this thing rotating.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's rotating one way
with some people and sometimes

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:21.623 align:middle line:90%
the other way.

01:15:21.623 --> 01:15:22.845 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

01:15:22.845 --> 01:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to be
connected to male or female.

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we would get them
to simply go down and let

01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:37.910 align:middle line:84%
their spirit touch the surface
of this rotating tortial field,

01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:41.010 align:middle line:90%
and vortex actually.

01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:44.565 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, they
become like a leaf on a river

01:15:44.565 --> 01:15:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that you just connect.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.940 align:middle line:90%
And the river takes the leaf.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:51.402 align:middle line:84%
And so they just start going
around, and around, and around.

01:15:51.402 --> 01:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's like water
going down the drain.

01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:56.270 align:middle line:90%
They go around, drrreeew, phfft.

01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And it takes you right
into the sacred space.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%
It works every time.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
The only problem with this is
that it's really easy for men

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.080 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.250 align:middle line:90%
It's hard for females.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:10.350 align:middle line:90%
It's too logical.

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And so after that,
I decided that I'm

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.040 align:middle line:90%
going to try some other ways.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And another way that we
tried was the way of Jesus,

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Jesus also had.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And this was written
in the Gnostics,

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.160 align:middle line:84%
in their writings
and everything.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.165 align:middle line:90%
But it got corrupted.

01:16:35.165 --> 01:16:38.060 align:middle line:90%


01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said that the opening to
the sacred place of the heart

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.020 align:middle line:90%
is behind the heart.

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of the people that
were recording this probably

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.980 align:middle line:84%
corrupted it on purpose because
for about the last 2,000 years

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
so much spiritual
knowledge that you

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
read in books they
purposely lied because they

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.029 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to tell the truth.

01:17:04.029 --> 01:17:05.570 align:middle line:84%
They would tell
everything the truth.

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But then the real big secret,
they would distort it somehow.

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:09.685 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd tell
all their people, well,

01:17:09.685 --> 01:17:10.720 align:middle line:90%
it's all true but that.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.330 align:middle line:90%
And you know what to do.

01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes down through
time, that it comes off as

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.839 align:middle line:90%
it just isn't true.

01:17:16.839 --> 01:17:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
be really careful.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.463 align:middle line:84%
A lot of stuff that's
written spiritually, it just

01:17:20.463 --> 01:17:22.824 align:middle line:84%
isn't actually
accurate information.

01:17:22.824 --> 01:17:23.990 align:middle line:90%
That happens in science too.

01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.640 align:middle line:90%
We do the same thing.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.389 align:middle line:90%
You make a patent.

01:17:25.389 --> 01:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
You tell everything
about a patent.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.290 align:middle line:90%
But you keep the secret out.

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:32.530 align:middle line:84%
The thing that actually
makes it work, you hide it.

01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And they do that in
patents all the time.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.558 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the patent
and you try to do it,

01:17:36.558 --> 01:17:39.745 align:middle line:84%
the darn thing won't work in
the way that they want you to.

01:17:39.745 --> 01:17:43.690 align:middle line:90%


01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So what Jesus did, what you do
is you go, just like you did,

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.337 align:middle line:90%
you go down and through.

01:17:48.337 --> 01:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
You go over to the heart so you
can see, or sense, or feel it.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you turn so that it's
on the right side of you.

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And you go back, to
the back of the heart.

01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And you keep going until
you're all the way to the back.

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you get back behind
it until you can see, or sense,

01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:06.100 align:middle line:90%
or feel it all in front of you.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a vortex.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:12.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a little, tiny vortex,
like a crevice that comes down.

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of in the
middle, approximately.

01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:16.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's rotating.

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a vortex.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:21.620 align:middle line:84%
It'll usually come off as a
light spot or a dark spot.

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.689 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do
is you just approach it.

01:18:25.689 --> 01:18:26.980 align:middle line:90%
You just keep moving toward it.

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you get right up
to it, it just pulls you in.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.290 align:middle line:90%
It just sucks you right in.

01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:38.335 align:middle line:84%
And it's a tube that you're
only going a little ways.

01:18:38.335 --> 01:18:40.960 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like you're going
a long ways when you're in this.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is you're
going down this tube.

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And it takes you down there.

01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you
can do about it.

01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:47.417 align:middle line:90%
It just pulls you down there.

01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you're just
moving, moving, moving,

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:50.208 align:middle line:90%
moving, moving, moving.

01:18:50.208 --> 01:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, it just stops.

01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're in the stillest
place in the universe.

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:59.109 align:middle line:84%
You're in the most
peaceful place there is.

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And you're in the center.

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're inside of the outer
place of the sacred place

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.130 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:06.320 align:middle line:90%
You're there.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.110 align:middle line:90%
It works every single time.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:12.780 align:middle line:84%
That one, I've discovered,
works for both men and women.

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:15.660 align:middle line:90%
So I use that one a lot.

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.700 align:middle line:90%
There is another one.

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Could you repeat
the circumstance?

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.860 align:middle line:90%
It's left to vortex?

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, sure.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:31.510 align:middle line:90%


01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Say this-- I don't have anything
that looks like a heart.

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.322 align:middle line:90%
Say this is the heart.

01:19:42.322 --> 01:19:44.810 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look like one.

01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:45.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's sitting here.

01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:47.800 align:middle line:90%
So you go down.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.330 align:middle line:90%
And then you go over to it.

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:51.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:53.080 align:middle line:90%
So you're over to the heart.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And now you want
to go to the back.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So you turn, which means it's
on the right side of you.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.350 align:middle line:90%
You turn and you go back.

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And you go back further
and you turn around.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
the heart from behind.

01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:13.070 align:middle line:84%
You're literally seeing it
from back here, like I am now.

01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:15.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's when you can look.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.190 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see there's a fold.

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little
rotating vortex there.

01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:21.840 align:middle line:90%
It's very small.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.310 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to
do is just go to it.

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And it'll, shrrp.

01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:28.235 align:middle line:90%
It's like a vacuum cleaner.

01:20:28.235 --> 01:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It sucks you right in, not quite
as hard as a vacuum cleaner

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:32.392 align:middle line:90%
would.

01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:33.350 align:middle line:90%

Whoo.

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It takes you in
gently, but powerfully.

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.654 align:middle line:84%
And you start moving
down this tube.

01:20:41.654 --> 01:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to do anything.

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:45.570 align:middle line:84%
You just keep moving, moving,
moving, moving until you stop.

01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:47.590 align:middle line:90%
And when you stop, you're there.

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:51.841 align:middle line:84%

today, if we want.

we come out from the heart

01:21:06.650 --> 01:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
You go down to the heart and
you have to go over to it.

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:10.590 align:middle line:90%
And you're on this side.

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to go to
the back and curve around

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.055 align:middle line:90%
to the back of it.

01:21:14.055 --> 01:21:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>But I don't go out
again in the back.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.291 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:21.520 align:middle line:90%
You're not in the heart.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.364 align:middle line:84%
You're on the
outside of the heart.

01:21:24.364 --> 01:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
You go to the
outside of the heart

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.160 align:middle line:84%
and go along the edge of
the heart to the back.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But then look at the
full heart from the back.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.830 align:middle line:90%
There, you'll see the vortex.

01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:34.890 align:middle line:90%
And then you approach it.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And it pulls you into the heart.

01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:40.160 align:middle line:90%
This is a very, very old way.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.290 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:43.110 align:middle line:90%
But it works.

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:45.160 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
that is pure female.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.670 align:middle line:90%
And it works for females.

01:21:46.670 --> 01:21:49.262 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work for
males very well.

01:21:49.262 --> 01:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was, you just
do the same thing.

01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
You go down to the heart
until you see or sense it.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.836 align:middle line:90%
You're right up there.

01:21:53.836 --> 01:21:54.730 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You go inside of it, just like
we did just a few minutes ago,

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.810 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same thing.

01:21:58.810 --> 01:22:02.080 align:middle line:84%
When you get inside
of it, if you can,

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
if you're female enough
and you can do it,

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:07.150 align:middle line:84%
you just say, OK,
I'm going to move.

01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And using your intention,
I'm going to move.

01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:13.982 align:middle line:90%
And the movement, I will move.

01:22:13.982 --> 01:22:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when I get to the
sacred place of the heart,

01:22:16.190 --> 01:22:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I will stop.

01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:20.120 align:middle line:90%
And you'll just start moving.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Only when you're moving
inside the heart,

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:24.420 align:middle line:90%
it feels like a big place.

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.400 align:middle line:90%
And you move.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And then it will just take
you right to the sacred space.

01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And again, you'll stop.

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's this
really still place.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like being in the eye
of a hurricane or something.

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.750 align:middle line:84%
You've got a lot of
stuff going on around.

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:40.557 align:middle line:84%
But in that place,
it's just still.

01:22:40.557 --> 01:22:41.140 align:middle line:90%
It's peaceful.

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>And it had the
vibrating noise going on.

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
It'll be vibrating
and it'll be dark.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.520 align:middle line:90%
It'll be black dark.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And then you ask for it.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.790 align:middle line:84%
No matter what techniques you
use to get in there, when you

01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:59.680 align:middle line:90%
get there, you ask for a light.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.459 align:middle line:84%
And the light, sometimes
it'll come on like that.

01:23:02.459 --> 01:23:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it won't.

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But whatever happens, once
you've asked for a light,

01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:06.960 align:middle line:90%
you put that intention out.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you do, you put
your attention on the vibration

01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and hear, or sense, or
feel that vibration.

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And once you feel the vibration,
then begin to make the sound.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And once you make
the sound, and you're

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:25.910 align:middle line:84%
real familiar with
what that sound is,

01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
for maybe 45 seconds or a
minute, stop making the sound.

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:34.332 align:middle line:84%
And then start becoming
aware, not of the vibration

01:23:34.332 --> 01:23:35.040 align:middle line:90%
or anything else.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Just becoming aware
of what's around you.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Because what's around
you is amazing.

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean you came here from
somewhere else at one point.

01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you came here--
before you came to Earth,

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
you had a reason
for coming to Earth.

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:55.760 align:middle line:90%
This is one point.

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.750 align:middle line:90%
You had a reason.

01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:57.660 align:middle line:90%
You had a mission.

01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.990 align:middle line:90%
It was really specific.

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And right now, most people
don't remember what that is.

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:04.734 align:middle line:84%
And you knew you
would come to a place

01:24:04.734 --> 01:24:05.900 align:middle line:90%
where you wouldn't remember.

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So you wrote it
down in your heart.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's always in the
outer space of the heart.

01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It could be written right
on the walls actually.

01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be in a language
you don't understand.

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And then at the right
moment, suddenly you

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.920 align:middle line:90%
can read the language.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Or it could inside of a crystal.

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:24.015 align:middle line:84%
And you hold it and
you see everything.

01:24:24.015 --> 01:24:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be, who knows?

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.880 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.140 align:middle line:90%
But you'll know what it is.

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But in there is recorded
the reason why you came here

01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and what your purpose was.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
The moment you remember
what your purpose was

01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
for coming here, it changes
your entire life's direction.

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:45.210 align:middle line:90%
You know why you're here.

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
You know exactly what
you're to do here.

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:49.366 align:middle line:90%
And it's a different thing.

01:24:49.366 --> 01:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like I know exactly
what I'm to do here.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing what I'm
supposed to do.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.196 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to
teach the Merkaba.

01:24:54.196 --> 01:24:55.375 align:middle line:90%
I have three things to do.

01:24:55.375 --> 01:24:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing those things.

01:24:56.610 --> 01:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I know I'm
fulfilling my purpose.

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you know-- who
knows what that purpose is.

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is,
it changes things.

01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
There's also another
thing that you

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.860 align:middle line:84%
have recorded in there, which
seems kind of funny in a way.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.310 align:middle line:90%
But we all have dreams.

01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And specifically,
we have a dream that

01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:28.660 align:middle line:84%
is the-- you might
say in English,

01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:33.800 align:middle line:84%
our deepest heart's desire,
that which we really

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.040 align:middle line:90%
want to see manifest.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually very close
to our mission or our purpose.

01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it's also
important to know

01:25:43.730 --> 01:25:48.220 align:middle line:90%
what we really want in life.

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So what's in our
heart is everything we

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:53.800 align:middle line:90%
need on those kind of levels.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But later, we're going to
talk about the creation

01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:57.370 align:middle line:90%
aspects of things, tomorrow.

01:25:57.370 --> 01:26:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's the power
that is in there.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.032 align:middle line:90%
That's another story.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:03.240 align:middle line:90%
That's really something else.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to program
you too much in terms

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:07.720 align:middle line:90%
of what's in there.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to save a
little bit of time for you.

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, I would prefer

01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
that you discover what
you are, who you are,

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and what is inside of
your own heart yourself.

01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And find out for yourself.

01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Because it's fun.

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And it really changes
everything in your life

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
once you connect into this
level of your existence.

01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going to lead
you into the outer space.

01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:43.110 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself in the
center-- in the tiny space,

01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:44.640 align:middle line:90%
that's fine.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But most of you have
not been in the space.

01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:49.440 align:middle line:90%
We only have 51 that have.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So we got 70 something--
8 or something,

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.800 align:middle line:90%
77 of them that haven't.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
When you find this
place, I'll lead you

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.650 align:middle line:84%
through what exactly-- ask
for light and the vibration.

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:07.941 align:middle line:84%
And I'll lead you through
this whole thing, all the way

01:27:07.941 --> 01:27:08.790 align:middle line:90%
through.

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards, I'm
going to leave you there

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
for about 25 minutes
or 20 minutes

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
or so, for you do just to
explore and feel what it is.

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:22.450 align:middle line:90%


01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to ask
you to do anything

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
in this one, other than just
to explore and become aware

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.571 align:middle line:84%
of the space, and
what it feels like,

01:27:32.571 --> 01:27:33.820 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, we're going to go
back in this space with a little

01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:41.649 align:middle line:84%
more intention and lead you
into the tiny space also.

01:27:41.649 --> 01:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I just want to
get you into the outer space.

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:49.810 align:middle line:90%


01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:52.890 align:middle line:84%
But once we're past
the point where you're

01:27:52.890 --> 01:27:54.980 align:middle line:84%
feeling the vibration,
you're making the sound,

01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:56.235 align:middle line:90%
then I'm going to leave you.

01:27:56.235 --> 01:27:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I have to say something
because I never

01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:00.110 align:middle line:90%
know what's going to happen.

01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I have this relationship
with the Kogi.

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to say
this because I never

01:28:06.570 --> 01:28:08.960 align:middle line:90%
know what they're going to do.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And they used to come
into these workshops

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.900 align:middle line:90%
every single time for years.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.322 align:middle line:84%
And then they
experimented with people.

01:28:19.322 --> 01:28:20.780 align:middle line:84%
They did all kinds
of things, which

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
was kind of interesting
because they were trying

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.567 align:middle line:90%
to figure out who you were.

01:28:24.567 --> 01:28:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And they did things.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Like one workshop,
they came in en masse.

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen that many.

01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:32.262 align:middle line:84%
Actually was one person for
every person in the room.

01:28:32.262 --> 01:28:32.970 align:middle line:90%
And they came in.

01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And then when you were deep in
the meditation, they came up

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and they rubbed the right cheek
of every person in the room

01:28:41.370 --> 01:28:42.801 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

01:28:42.801 --> 01:28:44.160 align:middle line:90%
And everyone, [YELLING].

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.560 align:middle line:90%
It was like that.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:47.200 align:middle line:90%


01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.076 align:middle line:90%
Who's there?

01:28:48.076 --> 01:28:51.840 align:middle line:90%


01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why they did it.

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:55.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean they do funny things.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.032 align:middle line:84%
I can always tell if
they come in before.

01:28:58.032 --> 01:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, before we
did the meditation,

01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:02.630 align:middle line:90%
I can always tell who can see.

01:29:02.630 --> 01:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
come in, they usually

01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:05.480 align:middle line:90%
come in through some wall.

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you get half
the group going, wow.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And the other group going,
what are you talking about?

01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:13.510 align:middle line:90%
You can't see him.

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:17.254 align:middle line:90%


01:29:17.254 --> 01:29:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they did
for a long time.

01:29:18.670 --> 01:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the guerrillas in
Colombia, killed the Mamos,

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.715 align:middle line:84%
machine-gunned them
down and killed them.

01:29:24.715 --> 01:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And nothing-- I mean
that's like killing Jesus.

01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:34.520 align:middle line:90%
They were really upset.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And then they killed more.

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
They killed up to
about 50 or so,

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Kogi and both Mamos
and the regular ones.

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
quit coming for a while.

01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
protect themselves I think.

01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
They just quit
for several years.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:56.956 align:middle line:84%
And recently, about a year
ago, they came back unexpected.

01:29:56.956 --> 01:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they came to
two or three workshops,

01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:02.730 align:middle line:84%
didn't come again for a
while, came to a couple more.

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:04.912 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

01:30:04.912 --> 01:30:07.370 align:middle line:84%
All I'm saying is I don't know
if they're going to be here.

01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And if they do then
I don't know what

01:30:10.670 --> 01:30:12.690 align:middle line:90%
they're going to do either.

01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Don't freak out.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't freak out.

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Don't scream too loud
if they do something.

01:30:18.190 --> 01:30:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Because they're just playing.

01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:23.990 align:middle line:84%
They will never do anything to
hurt you or be deceptive to you

01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:25.810 align:middle line:90%
in any way or anything.

01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:28.670 align:middle line:84%
They're like children
really, on a lot of levels,

01:30:28.670 --> 01:30:30.030 align:middle line:90%
really, really smart children.

01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:32.700 align:middle line:90%


01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And also [? Ima ?], who is
actually a Arhuacos woman,

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I have a very close
relationship with her.

01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when they do
come in, she comes in to me

01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:47.160 align:middle line:84%
because we have
this relationship.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And she may speak to you in
the language that has no words.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:57.750 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it creates
an image inside of you.

01:30:57.750 --> 01:31:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And if that happens, it happens.

01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:03.740 align:middle line:84%
It did about three
or four months ago.

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:04.450 align:middle line:90%
You'll know it.

01:31:04.450 --> 01:31:08.331 align:middle line:84%
Because when she makes those
sounds, it is powerful.

01:31:08.331 --> 01:31:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
if she will or not.

01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I just try to-- if it
happens, at least you

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.550 align:middle line:84%
know what's going on kind
of, rather than what's this

01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and where are all these
images coming from?

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.160 align:middle line:90%


01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:26.690 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:28.410 align:middle line:90%
It probably won't happen.

01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:29.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.782 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know.

01:31:31.782 --> 01:31:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'll lead you
through the whole thing.

01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:34.180 align:middle line:90%
I'll lead you to the end.

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.763 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm just
going to let you go.

01:31:35.763 --> 01:31:39.440 align:middle line:84%
At the very end, just so you
can get this clear in your head,

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to ask you to
come back from your heart

01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:42.930 align:middle line:90%
to your brain.

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to tell
you to stay in your heart

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and just come back
and open your eyes.

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And try to stay in your
heart as long as you can.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
is the first time

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.400 align:middle line:90%
you think a thought almost.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Then, chsk, you're back
in your brain again.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But stay as long as you can
in your heart afterwards.

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Also afterwards, I'm going
to ask about three people

01:32:07.290 --> 01:32:12.152 align:middle line:84%
to-- three or four people
that wish to, if you want to,

01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:14.110 align:middle line:84%
raise your hand, if you
want to talk about what

01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:14.985 align:middle line:90%
just happened to you.

01:32:14.985 --> 01:32:17.475 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like you
want to, raise your hand,

01:32:17.475 --> 01:32:19.110 align:middle line:84%
wait until you get
the talking stick.

01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you can describe what
happened in your experience.

01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:32.050 align:middle line:84%
If nothing happened, there's no
sense in telling people that.

01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:35.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:37.910 align:middle line:90%


01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:39.445 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't help anybody.

01:32:39.445 --> 01:32:43.540 align:middle line:90%


01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you did have
an experience--

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and most people will,
especially since we've only

01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:52.260 align:middle line:84%
got 51 people that are in here
that already know where it is.

01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, if you want to
speak after it, you can.

01:32:54.710 --> 01:32:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And then after
that, we'll be done.

01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.410 align:middle line:90%
That's it for the day.

01:32:58.410 --> 01:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
care what time it

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.810 align:middle line:84%
is when we get there, whatever
time it is that we're done.

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And then tomorrow-- so I
can just tell you this now

01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:11.010 align:middle line:84%
because once we get into this,
it's kind of hard to get back

01:33:11.010 --> 01:33:14.740 align:middle line:90%
to talk like this.

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:18.680 align:middle line:84%
We will then give you all
the information tomorrow

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:24.100 align:middle line:84%
of how to connect the heart and
all the technical information

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.940 align:middle line:84%
so that you understand
the whole procedure, all

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:31.000 align:middle line:84%
the way from the heart,
through the tongue,

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.580 align:middle line:84%
all the way out through
the various glands.

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing,
opening of the third eye

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and how that works, and how
it's related to the Merkaba,

01:33:40.570 --> 01:33:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and all that other stuff,
that will all be talked about.

01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we go and
do this tomorrow--

01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to do this
in nature if we could

01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow, as long as
everybody is OK with it.

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Nature.

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.020 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.940 align:middle line:90%


01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:03.106 align:middle line:84%
I got a really beautiful
place to take you.

01:34:03.106 --> 01:34:06.860 align:middle line:84%
You have to walk for
about 25 minutes--

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
20, 25 minutes or
so, off the road.

01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you got to walk
up to the spot, which

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:15.840 align:middle line:90%
is about six blocks.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to,
we can drive you up

01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:23.152 align:middle line:84%
to the spot, which will
save you some walking.

01:34:23.152 --> 01:34:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And we don't mind doing that.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:24.860 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:27.904 align:middle line:90%


01:34:27.904 --> 01:34:33.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's beautiful.

01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
difference when you're

01:34:34.710 --> 01:34:38.200 align:middle line:84%
trying to do this work with
the Earth and everything.

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.530 align:middle line:84%
When you're touching the Earth,
and not synthetic surfaces

01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and everything, it
just works better.

01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So the last one and the
last day, we'll do that.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.870 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll be done.

01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
You should have a really
good idea by that time

01:34:54.150 --> 01:34:56.260 align:middle line:90%
exactly what you're doing.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Then you go home
and you practice.

01:34:59.830 --> 01:35:02.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's all about.

01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:04.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, are you ready?

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.765 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:35:05.765 --> 01:35:06.265 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:35:06.265 --> 01:35:15.220 align:middle line:90%


01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.036 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy.

01:35:17.036 --> 01:35:18.818 align:middle line:84%
It's my favorite
thing in the world.

01:35:18.818 --> 01:35:22.650 align:middle line:90%


01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So just get comfortable,
move around, adjust yourself.

01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:30.229 align:middle line:84%
Do whatever you
have to do, cough,

01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:31.270 align:middle line:90%
all those kind of things.

01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:34.630 align:middle line:90%


01:35:34.630 --> 01:35:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Just play like you're
in your bedroom.

01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:40.440 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:52.070 align:middle line:90%


01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, remember your Merkaba.

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Feel the flow to
your heart chakra.

01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:06.440 align:middle line:90%


01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And also be aware of the
angel from the first day,

01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:12.140 align:middle line:90%
just feel them.

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:12.775 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

01:36:12.775 --> 01:36:19.770 align:middle line:90%


01:36:19.770 --> 01:36:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And this part of you
is really a protector.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:29.610 align:middle line:90%
It really does protect you.

01:36:29.610 --> 01:36:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to begin
by doing the unity breath.

01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:36.680 align:middle line:90%
And just follow.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to connect with
Mother Earth, and Father Sky.

01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:44.800 align:middle line:90%


01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Now in your inner vision, see
and remember a place in nature

01:36:55.890 --> 01:36:58.970 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the world
that you've been to

01:36:58.970 --> 01:37:05.820 align:middle line:84%
before, that you love, with no
buildings or anything around,

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:07.630 align:middle line:90%
just nature.

01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And it could be the mountains.

01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:13.052 align:middle line:10%
It could be the desert, the
beach, the ocean, whatever.

01:37:13.052 --> 01:37:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But begin to
visualize this place.

01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:16.320 align:middle line:90%
See it.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Where there's a river,
you see the river, clouds.

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Begin to see the
whole structure.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:28.810 align:middle line:90%


01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:31.625 align:middle line:84%
So continue to visualize
this beautiful place.

01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:36.420 align:middle line:90%


01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It also is bringing all your
senses, smell this place.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:54.590 align:middle line:90%


01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:57.836 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the water if
there's water there.

01:37:57.836 --> 01:37:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Hear it.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, feel how you feel
when you're there.

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Feel the love you have
for this place in nature

01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and now, begin to
transfer that love

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:18.270 align:middle line:84%
that you feel for that place
of nature to all of nature,

01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and to all of life on Earth,
and all the trees, and animals,

01:38:23.890 --> 01:38:26.650 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

01:38:26.650 --> 01:38:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, then go deeper.

01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And feel the love you have for
Mother Earth, for Pachamama.

01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:36.800 align:middle line:90%
And let this love grow.

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

01:38:38.050 --> 01:38:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Just let it open.

01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And feel the love
you have for her.

01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:46.640 align:middle line:84%
She has given you everything,
everything you own,

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:50.620 align:middle line:84%
every single thing you
own, including your body.

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.330 align:middle line:90%
She loves you.

01:38:52.330 --> 01:38:54.600 align:middle line:90%
She has always loved you.

01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel this love
is strong, with your intention

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.190 align:middle line:84%
send this love to the
center of the Earth

01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:09.450 align:middle line:84%
so that she can feel the
love you have for her.

01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you wait until you
feel her love come back to you

01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:19.620 align:middle line:84%
from inside the Earth and
come up inside of your body.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.930 align:middle line:84%
When you feel her
love come back to you,

01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
let it just go throughout
all of your bodies,

01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:29.920 align:middle line:84%
your physical body, your
mental body, emotional body,

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:31.720 align:middle line:90%
your light body.

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Let it move anywhere
it wants to go.

01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Just feel it in your heart how
much Mother Earth loves you

01:39:40.450 --> 01:39:44.100 align:middle line:90%
and how you love her.

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And now, without
breaking this connection

01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:51.170 align:middle line:84%
to Mother Earth and this
love, turn your attention

01:39:51.170 --> 01:39:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to Father Sky, which is
all the rest of creation,

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:58.370 align:middle line:84%
other than the
Earth, which includes

01:39:58.370 --> 01:40:02.460 align:middle line:84%
the Moon, all the
rest of creation.

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps look up
into a night sky.

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And you see the Milky Way
moving across the sky,

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and the planets, and the
beauty that is there.

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And feel the love that you
have for all of creation

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:23.530 align:middle line:90%
and for all life everywhere.

01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:28.290 align:middle line:90%


01:40:28.290 --> 01:40:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Your divine father
has been very quiet

01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:36.410 align:middle line:84%
because he's been letting
you have free will

01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:37.715 align:middle line:90%
and do as you wish.

01:40:37.715 --> 01:40:41.160 align:middle line:90%


01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.040 align:middle line:90%
But he is like you.

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.300 align:middle line:84%
There's never, ever been a time
when the body of the universe

01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:48.800 align:middle line:90%
has not loved you.

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And so when your love feels
strong, with your intention

01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:58.130 align:middle line:84%
send it either to the
grids, or to the Sun,

01:40:58.130 --> 01:41:00.920 align:middle line:90%
or to the central Sun.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Or even, just with
your attention,

01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.660 align:middle line:90%
you can sent it into space.

01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Because it is intention.

01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:10.810 align:middle line:90%
That is how life feels.

01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And so let him know
that you love him

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.610 align:middle line:90%
in the same way as your mother.

01:41:18.610 --> 01:41:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And you wait for this feeling
of love from the heavens

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:24.017 align:middle line:90%
to come in to you from above.

01:41:24.017 --> 01:41:26.640 align:middle line:90%


01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.750 align:middle line:84%
When you feel this love
come into your body,

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:32.750 align:middle line:84%
like your mother, let
it move through all

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
of your bodies, the physical
body, all your cells, all

01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:41.640 align:middle line:84%
the levels, your emotional
body, your mental body,

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
your light body, and
Merkaba, everything.

01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:47.400 align:middle line:90%


01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And now feel both
of them at once.

01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Feel your mother and
the Earth, Father Sky.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Feel their love.

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Feel how much they love you.

01:41:58.750 --> 01:42:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Feel how much you love them.

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And also feel the love that
they have between each other.

01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And in doing this, you have
brought the holy trinity

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:11.940 align:middle line:90%
onto Earth.

01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And this relationship
of this flow of love

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:21.820 align:middle line:84%
produces a vibration
within your spirit.

01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:25.806 align:middle line:84%
That is the key, not only
to entering your heart,

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:31.890 align:middle line:84%
but many, many, many other
levels of higher consciousness.

01:42:31.890 --> 01:42:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So as you're feeling this
love, bring your attention

01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to the center of your head,
into the pineal chakra.

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.640 align:middle line:90%
And feel the skull around you.

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:49.310 align:middle line:90%
And remember your physical body.

01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, let go of that place.

01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself
moving down your throat

01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:54.990 align:middle line:90%
to your throat chakra.

01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:58.510 align:middle line:90%


01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:59.826 align:middle line:90%
And wait there one moment.

01:42:59.826 --> 01:43:02.640 align:middle line:90%


01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, let go of this place.

01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And move down into your chest.

01:43:09.230 --> 01:43:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And continue moving until you
can see, or sense, or feel

01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:19.890 align:middle line:84%
your physical heart
directly in front of you.

01:43:19.890 --> 01:43:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And now turn and go to
the back of the heart.

01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
use the one that's

01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:29.870 align:middle line:84%
been used for thousands
of years, by Jesus.

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Go to the back of the heart.

01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Go a little bit further
behind the heart.

01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And turn and face the same
direction that you normally

01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:40.750 align:middle line:90%
look out of your body.

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're
behind the heart.

01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Looking directly in front of
you is the back of the heart.

01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:49.225 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
crevice you can see.

01:43:49.225 --> 01:43:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And in there is a
little rotating spot.

01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:55.570 align:middle line:84%
You may see it as a
light rotating place.

01:43:55.570 --> 01:43:58.310 align:middle line:90%
You may see it as a dark one.

01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:00.140 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Begin to move toward that place.

01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself moving toward it
and getting closer, and closer,

01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:07.570 align:middle line:90%
and closer.

01:44:07.570 --> 01:44:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And now just go right into
it and just let it pull you.

01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to resist it.

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself moving
down this tube.

01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And how long we move
depends on a lot of factors.

01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you've
going to come to this place

01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.830 align:middle line:90%
where you stop.

01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:31.445 align:middle line:84%
And you'll feel the
stillness of this place.

01:44:31.445 --> 01:44:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And you're there.

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Just trust it.

01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:37.030 align:middle line:84%
If you wish there to be light,
ask for there to be light.

01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:39.600 align:middle line:90%


01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, it may or may
not come immediately.

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And now turn your
attention, whether you

01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:48.330 align:middle line:84%
see the light or not,
turn your attention

01:44:48.330 --> 01:44:51.470 align:middle line:90%
to sensing the vibration.

01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:54.880 align:middle line:90%
It's all around you.

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.220 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:04.280 align:middle line:84%
You can hear it, sense it, any
way that you can connect to it.

01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you do hear it or
sense what the vibration is,

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:14.397 align:middle line:84%
begin to make the sound that
you're hearing by humming.

01:45:14.397 --> 01:45:18.053 align:middle line:90%


01:45:18.053 --> 01:45:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And try to duplicate it
as close as possible.

01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:26.490 align:middle line:90%


01:45:26.490 --> 01:45:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Then after a minute or so, let
go of that and begin to explore

01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:38.774 align:middle line:84%
and be just like a little
child and have fun.

01:45:38.774 --> 01:45:42.599 align:middle line:90%


01:45:42.599 --> 01:45:43.390 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back later.

01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:47.374 align:middle line:90%


01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:50.302 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

01:45:50.302 --> 01:45:58.110 align:middle line:90%


01:45:58.110 --> 01:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there anyone who
would like to speak

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.070 align:middle line:90%
about their experience?

01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:05.090 align:middle line:90%


01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:06.590 align:middle line:90%
It's over here.

01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:16.570 align:middle line:90%


01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:25.266 align:middle line:84%
>>First, I found myself
going into the vacuum.

01:46:25.266 --> 01:46:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I was pulled in it.

01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:31.800 align:middle line:90%
I found myself in nature.

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And immediately I knew.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Lemuria or
I recognized it somehow.

01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling free.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I found
myself in front of a temple.

01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But I was not allowed
to get in first.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.160 align:middle line:84%
There was somebody
waiting outside.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.830 align:middle line:90%


01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Then I helped that person.

01:47:03.690 --> 01:47:08.185 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I was pulled up.

01:47:08.185 --> 01:47:11.619 align:middle line:90%
I flew up.

01:47:11.619 --> 01:47:12.910 align:middle line:90%
There was another temple there.

01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:14.535 align:middle line:90%
It was a temple.

01:47:14.535 --> 01:47:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like a
marble, made of marble.

01:47:17.710 --> 01:47:20.470 align:middle line:90%


01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:23.740 align:middle line:90%
And there was a platform there.

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:26.850 align:middle line:90%
It seems like there were beings.

01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:28.620 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know who they were.

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.260 align:middle line:90%
They were very close to me.

01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I asked the question, I
want to see why I am here?

01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So I saw a writing,
a small writing,

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.910 align:middle line:90%
to remember who you are.

01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:44.930 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect that.

01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I expected something else.

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:51.770 align:middle line:84%
But it was different,
to remember who you are.

01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:53.670 align:middle line:90%
I stayed there for a while.

01:47:53.670 --> 01:47:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And then another
vacuum just pulled me.

01:47:58.550 --> 01:48:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I just saw some vibrations.

01:48:02.290 --> 01:48:06.066 align:middle line:84%
That was it, vibrations,
just vibrations.

01:48:06.066 --> 01:48:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was a point where
everything was inside.

01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:17.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean where everything was one.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
the point of creation.

01:48:22.290 --> 01:48:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I could
create anything I want.

01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And it would be coming easily
to me, just vibrations.

01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's all.

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:48:33.230 --> 01:48:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:48:33.730 --> 01:48:36.890 align:middle line:90%


01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>I reached a place.

01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a cave.

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It feels like it's
a cave on the Moon.

01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:46.940 align:middle line:84%
But the roof of the
cave is all the stars.

01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:50.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a black night
with all the stars.

01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I knew,
I was flying to Angel Falls.

01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:59.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's in South America.

01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I was guided
through the water

01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:06.380 align:middle line:84%
into a cave behind the falls,
and taken deep into the cave,

01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:09.980 align:middle line:84%
there was a pond,
a very dark pond.

01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was guided to
jump in that pond.

01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And as I jumped into it,
I went like a birth canal,

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.050 align:middle line:84%
going deep, deep,
deep into the Earth.

01:49:20.050 --> 01:49:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And I came to a place that
was pitch black, black

01:49:23.050 --> 01:49:28.180 align:middle line:84%
like I've never
felt or seen before.

01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was in that
darkness for a long time.

01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Until all of a sudden, these
eyes started to open up.

01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And I said, mama.

01:49:39.190 --> 01:49:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And she said
welcome, my daughter.

01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And then all these
eyes started opening.

01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And all I could see was the
white and the darkness of them,

01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.490 align:middle line:90%
the middle of the eye.

01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Many eyes were opening.

01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I was looking and seeing
all these beings around me

01:49:55.470 --> 01:50:00.644 align:middle line:84%
with their eyes open, you
were telling us to come back.

01:50:00.644 --> 01:50:01.144 align:middle line:90%
>>Um.

01:50:01.144 --> 01:50:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>>So it was amazing.

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I felt very much at home
in my mother's womb.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:21.510 align:middle line:90%


01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>When I entered the back of the
heart and started going inside,

01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:32.160 align:middle line:84%
a face came in front
of me that looked

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.240 align:middle line:90%
like an aborigine person.

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And then it just kind of stared
me in the eye and then left.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And then another face came
and it was [INAUDIBLE].

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:50.740 align:middle line:90%


01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was like much more
formed than in the first one

01:50:55.890 --> 01:50:57.940 align:middle line:90%
and just stared at me.

01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And then he left.

01:50:59.970 --> 01:51:02.080 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm walking.

01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
kind of moving.

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
whole field of flowers.

01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I went to go
pick one of them.

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And I went to pick it
and I could smell it.

01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was excited about being
able to smell the flowers.

01:51:23.370 --> 01:51:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to smell all of
the flowers in the field.

01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:31.270 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't.

01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:33.760 align:middle line:90%
The smell came at once.

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And I could smell the
whole field at once.

01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:41.970 align:middle line:90%
And then that all disappeared.

01:51:41.970 --> 01:51:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And an opening of the
cave was in front of me.

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And there was lightning
on the outside of it,

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.850 align:middle line:90%
that I could see.

01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:54.070 align:middle line:90%
But I walked.

01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:56.780 align:middle line:90%
And that went.

01:51:56.780 --> 01:52:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And then there was a triangle.

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.150 align:middle line:90%
And I sat inside of it.

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was a amethyst
on one side, crystals.

01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.870 align:middle line:90%
And on the right was citrines.

01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And in front were
rose-quartz crystals.

01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:17.050 align:middle line:90%
And I sat inside of it.

01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat there
and stayed there

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:24.500 align:middle line:90%
until you said to come back.

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:25.860 align:middle line:90%
It was hard to come back.

01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:30.200 align:middle line:90%


01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:32.320 align:middle line:90%
OK, one more person.

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:38.480 align:middle line:90%


01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>It was very easy to
see the vortex of light

01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:46.010 align:middle line:84%
when you're invited
to see that, to enter.

01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I got in, it
was very light actually.

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:53.220 align:middle line:90%
And I saw myself in this tunnel.

01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And the walls was made like
the Inca walls, very perfect,

01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:04.090 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, just a huge
stone, without any break.

01:53:04.090 --> 01:53:06.680 align:middle line:90%
And so I started to walk.

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:11.072 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I got in a chamber
that was all made by crystals.

01:53:11.072 --> 01:53:13.190 align:middle line:90%
And there was spear medicine.

01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most clear and
vibrant crystals I ever felt.

01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I sat in a
mandala made by crystals.

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
because I was sitting.

01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And I knew there
was a lot of points,

01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:31.330 align:middle line:90%
the crystals was pointed.

01:53:31.330 --> 01:53:33.390 align:middle line:90%
But I was sitting on it.

01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And then certainly I saw you
in my back with this huge mask,

01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.950 align:middle line:90%
like an Aztec warrior.

01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:47.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, this is strange.

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know there was supposed
to be anybody here with me.

01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, in
each point of the mandala,

01:53:53.730 --> 01:53:56.780 align:middle line:84%
there was you with
different masks.

01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And the one that was in
front of me was very ancient.

01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you said
to me-- because you

01:54:04.330 --> 01:54:07.020 align:middle line:84%
knew I was asking
what does this mean?

01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And so you said,
I'm a Melchizedek.

01:54:09.630 --> 01:54:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm all of them
and none of them.

01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
tell me all about how

01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:18.360 align:middle line:90%
this shift will happen.

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:19.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember anything.

01:54:19.530 --> 01:54:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But you was telling
me exactly how

01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:24.400 align:middle line:90%
everything is going to happen.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was paying attention.

01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Like I had to learn
those things so I

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:32.930 align:middle line:84%
would follow the instructions
as they was happening.

01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:33.870 align:middle line:90%
But I'm back.

01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:35.724 align:middle line:90%
And I don't remember.

01:54:35.724 --> 01:54:36.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:54:36.610 --> 01:54:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:54:37.690 --> 01:54:39.394 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had.

01:54:39.394 --> 01:54:39.893 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

01:54:39.893 --> 01:54:43.890 align:middle line:90%


01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is a dream.

01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:54.450 align:middle line:90%
It is a dream state.

01:54:54.450 --> 01:54:58.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a state that
generates images.

01:54:58.790 --> 01:55:01.770 align:middle line:90%
The images can be anything.

01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:03.342 align:middle line:90%
And there are no rules.

01:55:03.342 --> 01:55:06.340 align:middle line:90%


01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:08.077 align:middle line:90%
But they are tied.

01:55:08.077 --> 01:55:11.400 align:middle line:90%


01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:13.880 align:middle line:90%
There's much to these images.

01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:17.091 align:middle line:90%
It's going to take a while.

01:55:17.091 --> 01:55:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I need time tomorrow to explain
more about what the images mean

01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:25.020 align:middle line:90%
and what their potential are.

01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:31.040 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, we have
finished this first day.

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And tomorrow is where
everything comes together.

01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:36.830 align:middle line:84%
All the various days
that we've done,

01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:38.870 align:middle line:84%
it all comes together in
this one day tomorrow.

01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So tomorrow is the most
important day of all.

01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And where we will tie
everything together,

01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:47.280 align:middle line:84%
all those beams of
light, and the stuff

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.610 align:middle line:84%
in the heart, and the Merkaba
field, and the whole thing.

01:55:51.610 --> 01:55:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And how you create from the
heart and how you do this.

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:59.632 align:middle line:84%
And then we will do
one final meditation.

01:55:59.632 --> 01:56:03.950 align:middle line:84%
At which point, it's
everything you need.

01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And anything that you do
need after that, you will

01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:08.773 align:middle line:90%
know exactly how to get to it.

01:56:08.773 --> 01:56:09.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll explain.

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:13.910 align:middle line:84%
You can come up with any--
whatever form of guidance

01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:17.280 align:middle line:84%
or anything that you
need from now on,

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:19.255 align:middle line:84%
you should be able to
get within yourself.

01:56:19.255 --> 01:56:21.950 align:middle line:90%


01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:29.480 align:middle line:84%
If you need anyone else, well,
then you can achieve that also.

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But you'll have everything
you need, as far as I know,

01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:37.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to continue
all the way from there

01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:39.747 align:middle line:90%
to the next level of existence.

01:56:39.747 --> 01:56:44.160 align:middle line:90%


01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.310 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Good evening.

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:52.945 align:middle line:90%
And I love you.

01:56:52.945 --> 01:56:56.270 align:middle line:90%


01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're a
little confused right now,

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.008 align:middle line:90%
don't worry about it.

01:57:01.008 --> 01:57:02.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:04.500 align:middle line:90%
You'll be fine.

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:07.560 align:middle line:90%
So tomorrow morning, 9 o'clock.

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.454 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:15.990 align:middle line:90%


01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:18.050 align:middle line:90%
You have completed day four.

01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can go on to day five.

01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a day called
Tantra of the Heart.

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:34.400 align:middle line:90%
