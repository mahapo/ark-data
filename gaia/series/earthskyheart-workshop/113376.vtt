00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>I realize that you
are all different levels

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.150 align:middle line:90%
of being able to do this.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully you all
know the merkaba.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.130 align:middle line:90%
That's a big advantage.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to talk about
that, which takes forever.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that most of
you have your beams out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.416 align:middle line:84%
I've looked at
quite a few of you.

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You're doing very well,
most of them I've seen.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Better than I've seen before.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know really why.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Usually when they
come out, the beams

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.227 align:middle line:84%
are usually not perfectly
straight for a while.

00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
They'll come out and they'll
kind of droop or bend

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:90%
or something else like that.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You want to know the
funny thing is we're

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.026 align:middle line:90%
talking about sexual energy.

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It took me a long time
to figure this out.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you see
people and things

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.918 align:middle line:84%
go like this, their
little like horns.

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:53.358 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
just kind of funny.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But it is interesting
when somebody really

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
gets into creation and
they're doing sexual energy,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:90%
they're really into it.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Their little side ones
kind of turn into horns.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that's maybe why we
say that or think about it.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But they do become horns in
other animals and things.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
They literally, that is the
places where they emerge.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so we know the merkaba.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
We've got our
beams of light out.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I think you've done
pretty good on that.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Just keep working
on it and I don't

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:90%
think there'll be a problem.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Usually it just requires
a little more energy.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
When they're crooked or got
a little bends or things

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
like that, just
means more energy.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:90%
They'll straighten out.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.418 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like in
those long balloons.

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:84%
You blow them and
they're not quite full.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:90%
They pop out.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:90%
It'll do that.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we then know
about the heart.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's varying
degrees of some people

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
can get in, some people
can't, et cetera.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And that one, the easiest way
is to really be very childlike

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.450 align:middle line:90%
when you're doing that.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:90%
And not get stressed out.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I gotta do this,
I gotta do this.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
You'll never do it
with that attitude.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:90%
You have to be relaxed.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And the connection to
the earth and to the sun

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to create that vibration
that gets inside of you.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Find your way.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Today when I lead
you through, we'll

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:84%
bring you back through
the-- I'm going

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:90%
to use a different system.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Because yesterday
we used the one

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
where we go behind
the heart and go in.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And for all of you
that are already there,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.939 align:middle line:90%
you just go there.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to listen
to what I'm doing.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:90%
You can just go to your heart.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about it.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But for the other
ones, we're going

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:90%
to try a different way today.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It's simpler and
it's more female.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
We just go into the
heart and use intuition.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
You say, I'm going to move, and
when I stop, I will be there.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:90%
And you just start moving.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it moves all
around in different ways

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.249 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes it
goes straight to it.

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it does,
when you stop you're there

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and you just have
to trust yourself.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a very simple,
easy way to work.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But it does work
for a lot of people.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:90%
So we tried the other one.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Now we'll try this one.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But now you can use it a second
time, that same procedure.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
It always leads you into the
outer part of the sacred place

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But now you need to
find the tiny place.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And that sometimes
takes a long time.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you use your intuition,
again, and you ask for light,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
you feel the vibration,
and now you're

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:84%
sitting there
inside the outside,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
let yourself move again
with the intention

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.384 align:middle line:84%
that your movement will take
you straight to that place.

00:04:06.384 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
get there, it'll

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.633 align:middle line:84%
either put you right
in it or it'll bring it

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:90%
right up to where it is.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:90%
And just trust it.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:90%
And go in.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And so today we need
to find the tiny space.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're going to do.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Everybody understand that?

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Once we get into the tiny
space, then immediately

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
you begin to rub that spot
on the tip of the tongue.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Remember to pull it out,
sucking like the clicking sound,

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.120 align:middle line:90%
pulling it out.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:90%
And then begin to massage.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And every two, three,
four, five minutes

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
if it starts to
get a little dry,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
stop, lubricate
it, and keep going.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And you just keep doing that.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And then once you do that,
you bring your attention

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
to the pineal gland.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Not the chakra, but the gland.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And with your intention, you
have it look at this spot

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:90%
up here.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's looking
up and you turn it

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
so that it looks
through this place.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment when you're
looking through that place,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
it isn't essential,
but it will help you

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:84%
if you slightly cross your eyes
and you look at this place.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:90%
So your eyes can be closed.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
But you ever so cross
them a little bit so

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking up
high where this place is.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Because it'll keep you
focused on looking out

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:90%
of here and not out of here.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy when you're
in meditation to forget.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
You're doing all this
stuff, but you're actually

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:84%
looking out of these
eyes and nothing happens.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:84%
You can do it for 10 years,
but nothing will happen.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
You must look out of
this higher place.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.792 align:middle line:84%
You know like in India,
you see the little red dot

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:90%
that they put in.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But very often it's usually
down low, down here.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the place.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:90%
It really is a lot higher.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.291 align:middle line:90%
It's way up here.

00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm spending a
lot of time on that,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's one of the places
where people make mistakes.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
little mistakes that

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:90%
could just ruin everything.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you look toward
the pituitary chakra.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And the pituitary
chakra is kind of

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.686 align:middle line:84%
like when you're looking at
this one inside of yourself,

00:06:42.686 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:84%
when you're putting
the beams of light.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It'll be either
brighter or darker

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
in a little spot
in front of you.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you're aiming at.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be
up here, not down here.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be high.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And you just look
at that and you

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:84%
watch it and you have to then
wait for this green light.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
If the green light
doesn't appear,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
you can't go beyond
that at this time.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:90%
But you know what to do.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:90%
So you have to practice.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:90%
And you'll find a place.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Again, very often
when you get home

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the safety of your
own little place and everything

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.930 align:middle line:84%
else, there's not people
watching, all other stuff.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.445 align:middle line:90%
It's sometimes easier.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And at which point,
that light will appear.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I've heard this so
many times from people.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I couldn't do
it in the class.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I tried and I tried,
but when I got home

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:84%
it seemed easier somehow
and we were able to do it.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So once the green
light happens, then

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:84%
remember you'll see
it spiral, connect,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
at which point instantly behind
that you can follow right

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
through with your intention
and connect to the one

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:90%
out in space in front of it.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:84%
That point the sphere
will appear around you.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.995 align:middle line:90%
And this will all be a halo.

00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It'll all be glowing
around your head.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And you are now in the
exact configuration

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:90%
to begin the process.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't say
last time and I'll say now

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
is that, say you've
done all this.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.900 align:middle line:90%
It's all happening.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:90%
You've connected all the beams.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything's there.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to think about
the sphere or the color.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to see that
because you're in meditation.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But once you've done all that,
you keep the tongue going.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:90%
But forget this.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Forget all this.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
Bring your attention back down
to the tiny place in the heart.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Keep the tongue going and
just be in the image world

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.765 align:middle line:84%
and just stay in the image
world and watch the images.

00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:51.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:84%
You can totally get into the
images and anything else,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
but just keep the physical
body connected with the tongue.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
At which point, you can
either use intention

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually
create the images

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to
let the images flow

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and let life work through
you, depending on your nature

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and who you are.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.401 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about this
tiny space for just a moment

00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
The tiny space is where all
the worlds were created.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Every last planet,
every last galaxy.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
created from there.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place where what you
realize after time is that when

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:84%
you're in this space and you're
there, you and God are one.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know some people
have a hard time even saying

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:90%
those words.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think you'll come
to the same conclusion.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:84%
You can think of yourself
merging with God or God

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:90%
merging with you.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But you're not
human in that space.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:90%
You're something else.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And all sacred, all tiny spaces
of the heart are all one.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.920 align:middle line:90%
They're the same.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things we used to do,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and you could still do this
even now if you want to,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
if you have someone that's
died before, they're not even

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
here anymore, but you
can go into that space

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and ask them to be there
and poof, there they are,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:84%
real, and the body that they
had, that you're familiar with.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:90%
And you can talk to them.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's real time.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I've even had people prove it.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
People have died
and this person was

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.080 align:middle line:84%
talking about where they
left something in the ground

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:84%
somewhere or something
and nobody knew or was

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:90%
or how to get to it.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.232 align:middle line:84%
And when they went in there,
they just said, where is it?

00:10:59.232 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And they said
exactly where it was.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Bam, that's right where it was.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
You can set things up
to prove, if you want.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:90%
And I do this all the time.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:90%
I want to know.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It's either real
or it's not real

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know
for sure it's real.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always making
tests to find out.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:90%
The heart is like your mother.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Children test their
mothers all the time.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you don't
love your mother or anything.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just you're checking
things out and it's all right,

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:90%
it's OK.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And so you can run tests on it.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And those tests,
when you see them,

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.770 align:middle line:90%
they increase your confidence.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:84%
They make you
stronger and allows

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.005 align:middle line:90%
you to do greater things.

00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So another thing
that you can do,

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
which is very
powerful in evolution,

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
is when you're in
that tiny space,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:84%
you can bring your
higher self in.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It's probably easiest to
bring the angelic world,

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
because we're so close
in vibration to them.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.791 align:middle line:84%
But you could bring higher
forms of yourself in.

00:12:11.791 --> 00:12:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can talk to yourself
right then and there.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes by making that
connection inside your heart

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.890 align:middle line:84%
to your part of
your higher self,

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
we have higher selves
to higher selves even.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's more
complex than it seems.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But once you make connection
visually with your higher self,

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
that in itself is a
big accomplishment.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Because then you're getting
information and guidance

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
from a part of you that not
only loves you, but would

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:90%
do anything to protect you.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you get very accurate
knowledge and information.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't always tell
what it is you need,

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:02.040 align:middle line:84%
but your higher self can tell
very well what it is you need.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a big one
when you get that one.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:90%
You can move really rapidly.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it in your heart
easily and in normal meditation

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
you might never be able
to find your higher self.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But in this, you can
get it really fast.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a great thing.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
lots and lots more.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And explore it, just
like you were a kid.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a brand new world in there.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.965 align:middle line:90%
And there's so much.

00:13:36.965 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:84%
My wife came into
my space one time.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.251 align:middle line:84%
And we went down
those little steps

00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about at the
end and into the green line

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.795 align:middle line:90%
where there's doors.

00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:53.295 align:middle line:84%
And we're going by one door and
we both could feel this door

00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:90%
and we opened this door.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And there in this thing
in the middle of it

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
was a gold statue of Claudette
and I in union together.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And all around it were these
crystals and all this stuff

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered that
in there, whenever

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
we would go in there together,
we could pick a crystal

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and it would begin to tell
us with images something

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:90%
that we both needed to know.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.094 align:middle line:84%
There was even a
huge treasure chest

00:14:30.094 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
over in the corner
where we lifted it up

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and it was filled with
all this gold and diamonds

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.690 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:90%
And we could draw upon that.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying you have that.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that
we're all different.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:84%
But within there is everything
that you need in existence,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:90%
no matter where you are.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:90%
It's in your heart.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
We are whole, complete, and
perfect, lacking nothing.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.829 align:middle line:84%
And the source of
how to heal anything,

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
the source how to bring anything
to us, how to bring balance,

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:84%
how to do it, it's
all in our heart.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
rely on your heart,

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.826 align:middle line:84%
the easier life gets
and the happier you get.

00:15:21.826 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:90%
This is a really good thing.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you guys
figure this out.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:90%
This is complicated.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:90%
The merkaba is complicated.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And just go slow.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Go at your own rate.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And don't be afraid or say,
oh, I'm not going to get this

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
lose it or something.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
You'll get exactly the right
time when you need to know

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:90%
and when it is.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:90%
But you have to stay consistent.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to keep working on it.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:90%
You can't forget.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to worry
about anything, nothing at all.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Just do it and it'll
all come about.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think I've done
a second overview.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully that
helped a little bit.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And now I'd like to ask
what questions you have,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
because I know there's
probably something

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:90%
in here you're not sure of.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:90%
So let's just begin.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to know
if it's always

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
needed to do the
thing with the tongue

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
or after a while
you can leave it.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing,
in what time do

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.570 align:middle line:84%
need to operate the merkaba
in the normal sequence?

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:84%
If you start from the
heart and not the merkaba.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, when we
rewrite everything,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
it's the same information
rewritten, we will begin here.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin
there, if somebody's

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:84%
starting all this work you've
been doing, if you begin here

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.159 align:middle line:84%
and you go up through
all these procedures

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and you go to the beam
and you set this up

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and you connect this in, the
merkaba goes out automatically.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do it.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.329 align:middle line:84%
And it's just an
automatic thing.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And then all you
have to do is learn

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.146 align:middle line:84%
how to program it,
et cetera, and all

00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:90%
that other kinds of things.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
You can actually do
the programming from,

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:84%
well-- there may be,
I don't know this yet,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:84%
there may be simpler
ways to do things.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.504 align:middle line:84%
Where you can, just as you
leave intention or not,

00:17:45.504 --> 00:17:47.420 align:middle line:84%
you can do the same thing
with the programming

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:84%
where you reside in here
and you let your merkaba

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
be programmed by your heart,
and without even your knowledge

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.490 align:middle line:90%
even if you want to.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And it'll just keep you exactly
protected and everything else

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the right leg
without you doing really

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:90%
anything really.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:84%
The female way is
always very simple

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:90%
compared to the male way.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:90%
The male way's always complex.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And so once we rewrite this,
I'll understand it more,

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
The other question, the
first you asked was?

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>If you need to do the thing
with the tongue all the time

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:90%
or after a while--

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
You only have to do this
thing with the tongue

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:90%
when you want to create.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:84%
If you just want to go into
your heart and be there,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to do the
thing with the tongue.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
link this together.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.390 align:middle line:90%
You can just be in here.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you wish to
create something,

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.602 align:middle line:84%
if you wish to know
something, well you

00:18:55.602 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:84%
can actually get to know
something without ever

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
going through here.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But still, see, every time
I try to make it simple,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I keep thinking of things
that are more complex.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:13.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways to
use this information.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is sort of
a beginning thing.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.084 align:middle line:84%
It's like what she was
talking about where

00:19:23.084 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
instead of going from here
to here, you go the nose,

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:90%
you go to the chin.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways to
use this configuration.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they all are.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Right now I'm only going
by what the angels tell

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.300 align:middle line:90%
me is necessary.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've dropped
out this entire thing

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.140 align:middle line:84%
down here below because
we don't need to know it.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And so there's a lot more.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:84%
My job is to get you
and me and everyone

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:90%
over into the fourth dimension.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Once I get you there,
you just won the game.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.527 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
from there on in,

00:19:57.527 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
your body's going
to grow really tall,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
get this big brain.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
You're going to know
a whole lot of stuff.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
You'll know
everything about this.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
The main thing right
now is just get there.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And the rest of it will happen.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So I know there are probably
a lot of other things

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:90%
we could do.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need to
know it right now.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you do and if
you need to know it,

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.055 align:middle line:84%
then you can go in your heart
and gain that information.

00:20:30.055 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
You can gain any knowledge
of any person that

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
has ever lived or ever will
live from within your heart.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:84%
It's literally infinite in
terms of what's possible.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>The correlation to get
through the tongue, that

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
would get-- it's temporarily
or after a while,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
after several times that
you do that, you don't

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.541 align:middle line:90%
need to use the tongue anymore?

00:20:56.541 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Any time ever that you are using
this system up here to connect

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
with the lower
sphere of the heart

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and you are going to do
something outside of this,

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to function with
both of these things together,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
what links them
together is the tongue

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:90%
on the roof of the mouth.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And the moment it's
broken, that's broken.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:90%
It stops.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:84%
However, if you've
been doing it,

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.875 align:middle line:84%
you break it like when
you're wet in your mouth

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and you go right back to it,
then it just instantaneously

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:90%
is right back again.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you take it away and
don't do it for 30 minutes,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:90%
it's gone.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
all over again.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.210 align:middle line:90%
It's just like sex.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same thing.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.555 align:middle line:84%
>>We didn't operate any of
the beams from the heart.

00:21:49.555 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:90%
It automatically gets activated?

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.525 align:middle line:90%
>>The beams of the heart.

00:21:53.525 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.150 align:middle line:84%
The angels have
described where they are

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.005 align:middle line:84%
and how they are and also with
the one below and how they work

00:22:02.005 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of stuff to me and
talked about the eight breaths.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a practice I'm
working on right now associated

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:90%
with the lower one.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But I don't fully
understand a lot of things

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that are associated
with these beams

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:90%
and how they work exactly.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
But again, they're just
giving me what I need to know.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And they've given me more
than I need to know, really,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.720 align:middle line:84%
but I do know that
any time you're

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:84%
going to use this in
association with the heart,

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:84%
you can't use this with a
heart without the tongue

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
on the roof of the mouth
moving and touching.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.439 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it.

00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes you just
want to go into your heart

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of explore,
like when Claudette and I

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.939 align:middle line:90%
went into that room.

00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We didn't need to do this,
because we didn't need that.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:90%
We were in the heart.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And we were just finding
this space that somehow we

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:90%
had both created.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And she has the similar
thing in her heart space.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're just
going to go into our heart

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and explore or be or
just have fun, fun,

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
which to me is really important,
then you don't have to do that.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing something
that involves making a change

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.254 align:middle line:84%
and altering something
in the outer reality,

00:23:31.254 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
you have to have the tongue
on the roof of the mouth

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and connect all
this stuff together.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>How long do you
have to keep doing

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.237 align:middle line:84%
that like at one
session at the time

00:23:48.237 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:90%
if you want to create something?

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>You mean with the tongue?

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>As long as you are--
until you're done.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Once you set this
up, then you've

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:84%
just got all the
energetic flow set up.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But then the real work happens
in the tiny space of the heart.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And so once you're in
there and you see the image

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and you see what it is that
you're about to create,

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:90%
then you just know, it's done.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
When you get to a place,
you just know it's done.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:90%
When it's done, it's done.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:90%
You can stop.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Awesome.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Because it happened.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
The translation from here
to the big outer sphere

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:90%
happens very fast.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly how fast,
but it's very, very quick.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.719 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it moves
from the toroidal field.

00:24:45.719 --> 00:24:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I talked
about that or not.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It moves from the,
pretty certain,

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
it's from the inner
toroidal field, which

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:90%
is from the inner space.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And those lines of energy move
up and connect at this point.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And these things, they
really are like antennae

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:90%
that receive these images.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that if we were in a
cosmic university right now,

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.320 align:middle line:84%
they would think this was
like a child's drawing

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.345 align:middle line:84%
and they would probably
go into extreme details

00:25:16.345 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds of levels.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But on a basic level, this
point is what's so important,

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:84%
this point above the head, one
hand length above the head,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:90%
approximately there.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:84%
That's where the image
comes in and these things

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:90%
are on the surface.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And the image first appears
here like a nanosecond before

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:90%
and then it goes to the big one.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:90%
And all of it happens very fast.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Once it's happened,
it's happened.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It's now reality.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
keep doing this anymore.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:90%
You can feel when it happens.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And then that's it.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:90%
You can stop.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do something
else or whatever.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.115 align:middle line:90%
But that's all it is.

00:26:03.115 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty simple.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you go back to
the same creation?

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Like in your case
with your house,

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:90%
you did it once and that's it?

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.401 align:middle line:90%
>>That's it.

00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:13.900 align:middle line:90%
One time.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] they're done.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:14.799 align:middle line:90%
>>That's it.

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:90%
It's happened.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:90%
It's now reality.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:90%
You may not see it right away.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
In our case, it took three
days before we saw it.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:90%
But that's not very long.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's happened.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth dimension,
though, if you

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:84%
were to do something similar to
this in the fourth dimension,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:90%
it happens instantaneously.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
If you saw the image, bam, it
would be there in front of you.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Babaji was really good at this.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:90%
Remember him?

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:84%
He was able to manifest
entire huge palaces

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and everything else like that
all with the blink of an eye.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.004 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same thing.

00:27:01.004 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
over and over.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.120 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that there's
some other spirituality.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:84%
You could go in a lot more
deeper, complex understanding

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.760 align:middle line:90%
of it all, but this is it.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:84%
There is one thing, in
terms of this lower circle.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
into all eight breaths,

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's very complex
and we don't need to know.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
But there is one thing that
they had me practicing.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.005 align:middle line:90%
And I'll explain that to you.

00:27:31.005 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It'll only take a few
minutes and it may

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:90%
help something you're doing.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:84%
In sexual energy,
the Ankhing, which we

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:84%
talked about in one of
the first two books.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.246 align:middle line:84%
Does everybody
know what that is?

00:27:47.246 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody not know
what I'm talking about?

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.285 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four, five.

00:27:52.285 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's quite a few people.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian philosophy, the
ankh is the key to eternal life.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And all the walls when you
see a person holding the ankh,

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:90%
it means they're immortal being.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:90%
They've been marked by that.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.270 align:middle line:90%
And they no longer die.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that their
body lives forever.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it means.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:84%
It means that their memory
remains intact forever.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.490 align:middle line:90%
They never lose memory again.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:90%
It goes on and on and on and on.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And also, even though
you've lost your memory now,

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:84%
immortality also means you gain
all your past memory as well.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the Ankhing is really
important in sexual energy.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I guess for people who
are watching this film,

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.330 align:middle line:84%
it is a good idea
that I do this.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.090 align:middle line:84%
There are energy lines and
channels besides the meridians

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and all these other kinds of
things, the way they flow.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.130 align:middle line:84%
There are geometrical
energy lines in the body.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And there is one that
runs straight up the body.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one
that runs, on a male,

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:90%
exactly across the nipples.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:90%
It goes out.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And that forms that cross,
the Christian cross.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
This being the heart chakra
exactly in the center.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:90%
It crosses between those two.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.140 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual energy flow
or lines that work on there.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look
at this from the top,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:45.380 align:middle line:84%
looking down at a human
being, you wouldn't see that.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:90%
But what you would see is that.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.100 align:middle line:90%
That's this way.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that there is
another one of these coming out

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:90%
three dimensionally this way.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you look above,
you can't see this line.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It's all in that one spot.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:90%
This line is that line.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
line coming out.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.960 align:middle line:90%
There's a cross from above.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And both of those symbols
are used for Christianity.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's another one
that's used in Christianity,

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.175 align:middle line:90%
which is this one.

00:30:18.175 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't drawn perfectly.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But all that should be exactly
at that point right there.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And this was a big, huge
secret a long time ago.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was pulled into
Christianity taken directly

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:90%
from Egyptian thought.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And what this is, is the
cross here and the three

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:90%
dimensionality of that cross.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But it adds one
line in there, which

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is simply a part of the
understanding of what's there.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.240 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at
someone from the front,

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:84%
you see this, from
the top, you see this.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at them from
the side, what you see is this.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.800 align:middle line:90%
You would see this.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:90%
And then you would see that.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:90%
There's a loop.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:84%
An energy loop that goes
through the 13th chakra

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.410 align:middle line:90%
back to the heart chakra.

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's physically there.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.390 align:middle line:90%
It's actually there.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you simply erase that,
you get the Egyptian ankh.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:84%
This is really an
important key in sexuality.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:54.050 align:middle line:84%
That what happens is that when
the energy comes up the spine,

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
this would be the spine here,
when it comes up the spine

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.880 align:middle line:84%
from the base of the
spine, it moves kind

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.180 align:middle line:90%
of like this as it's going up.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And passing through each one
of the chakras perfectly.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
But moving like a snake
as it goes up the spine.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:84%
If you have an orgasm in this
way, without doing anything,

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.210 align:middle line:84%
the energy goes up,
it goes out the top,

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and you just lost
all that energy.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:90%
You became weaker.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:84%
This is why in
Hinduism they actually

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.730 align:middle line:90%
tell men not to have orgasms.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the Hindus did not, they
missed some important stuff.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to try
to compensate for it.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.720 align:middle line:84%
They invented ideas that
the sperm would come up

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.850 align:middle line:84%
through these-- I
forget what they--

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:90%
nadis I think they were called?

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.847 align:middle line:84%
And they could see
what was happening,

00:32:59.847 --> 00:33:01.555 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't know
how to deal with it.

00:33:01.555 --> 00:33:04.606 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians knew exactly
what to do to deal with it.

00:33:04.606 --> 00:33:06.105 align:middle line:84%
And so the Egyptians
say no problem.

00:33:06.105 --> 00:33:08.014 align:middle line:84%
You can have as many
orgasms as you want.

00:33:08.014 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't make any difference.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Just do this and
it doesn't matter.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is the energy

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:84%
does not go up the
spine like that.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:90%
It goes up the spine like this.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And then it wraps around
here and comes back.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:90%
And it keeps reverberating.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I was in Holland one time
and they were testing this.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.584 align:middle line:84%
And they made these
long rods out of copper.

00:33:35.584 --> 00:33:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And they filled
them with crystals

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:37.958 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of stuff.

00:33:37.958 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know about that.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And in the bottom they
put a tuning fork.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So they had a rod like this
with a tuning fork at the end.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And at the top, they
had a place where you

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.730 align:middle line:90%
could screw different forms in.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:84%
There's four basic
Egyptian power forms.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And they tried
putting the ankh right

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.020 align:middle line:90%
on the very top like that.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:84%
Well when they took
the ankh off and they

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:84%
would strike the tuning
fork, and I could time it,

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:84%
and it would go for
certain length of time,

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.900 align:middle line:84%
which was a few seconds,
maybe 10 seconds or so.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.584 align:middle line:84%
And then the sound would go
away so you couldn't hear it

00:34:22.584 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:90%
very well after that.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you put the ankh on it
and hit the same tuning fork

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.384 align:middle line:84%
with the same rod,
the thing just

00:34:30.384 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
kept going on and
on and on and on.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.429 align:middle line:84%
It went like a
minute and a half.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could easily
see the difference in time.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happens in your spine.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.060 align:middle line:84%
If you bring it up
and you ankh it,

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.790 align:middle line:90%
the energy goes up your spine.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It then goes out the
back, comes back around,

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.699 align:middle line:84%
goes over through
the 13th point,

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:55.409 align:middle line:84%
it comes back down
to the heart chakra

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.096 align:middle line:84%
again, and then
goes down the spine.

00:34:57.096 --> 00:34:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps coming back up
and wrapping around and going

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.110 align:middle line:84%
back down and coming
up and wrapping around.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And so if you ankh
after orgasm, you

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.520 align:middle line:90%
give yourself a lot more energy.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:90%
You don't weaken yourself.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.740 align:middle line:90%
You strengthen yourself.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is their
belief that this leads

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:84%
into eternal life, the use
of sexual energy in this way.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:24.160 align:middle line:84%
You eventually become
immortal just by doing that.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.454 align:middle line:84%
And so that's something you'll
have to think about and decide

00:35:27.454 --> 00:35:28.620 align:middle line:90%
if you want to do it or not.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, it takes practice.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.474 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:35.474 --> 00:35:37.635 align:middle line:90%


00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>I can't even imagine
ever having an orgasm

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and not doing that
at this point.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:48.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.350 align:middle line:90%
You may not have noticed before.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.770 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know this.

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But the orgasm begins
with an in breath.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.070 align:middle line:90%
You pull it up.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And when your in breath
comes in, you pull it up.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's coming up.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets to this
point, by intention,

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.242 align:middle line:84%
you have to force
it out the back.

00:36:08.242 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
go out the front,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:84%
because just like there's an
anti life cycle and anti life

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.940 align:middle line:84%
cycle, if you go out the
front, it'll slowly kill you.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not slowly.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really sure.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even going to try it.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.375 align:middle line:90%
I believe my Egyptian teachers.

00:36:28.375 --> 00:36:30.464 align:middle line:90%
Says it goes out the back.

00:36:30.464 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
It's written right
on their walls.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It says it can only be
received from behind.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Meaning you have
to go out the back.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.374 align:middle line:84%
And so you may
say, OK, I'm going

00:36:41.374 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to do it right
when it gets there.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:84%
It goes up and you're
like, oh, darn.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.367 align:middle line:90%
Got to do it again.

00:36:46.367 --> 00:36:48.235 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:48.235 --> 00:36:51.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Really, it took me
three or four times.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Might take a little practice.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:90%
But eventually you'll get it.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And once you get it,
then the body gets it.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And once the body understands
it, it's easy after that.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Then you bring it up and it
just automatically goes around

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:90%
and comes in.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And the first few
times you do it,

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.470 align:middle line:84%
it feels like this
energy's coming down

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like
somebody went like that.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, actually hit you in
your chest, it's so powerful.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.750 align:middle line:84%
After you get used to it, you
don't feel that bam so much

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:25.250 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.290 align:middle line:90%


00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And once you set that
up and then it's just

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.369 align:middle line:90%
going to happen from then on.

00:37:32.369 --> 00:37:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Unless you put the intention
that you didn't want

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:35.700 align:middle line:90%
it to happen anymore.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know why, because
it makes a much stronger orgasm.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Lasts longer, feels better.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.440 align:middle line:90%
But it's healthier.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.270 align:middle line:84%
You're actually taking prana
from another dimensional world

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and you're bringing it
right into your body.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:84%
You're filling your
body with prana in a way

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.560 align:middle line:90%
that the body could really use.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a good thing.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.268 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good thing.

00:37:57.268 --> 00:38:01.248 align:middle line:90%


00:38:01.248 --> 00:38:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>The same [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it's the same.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:84%
When a man and a woman
are facing each other,

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
one's going one way and
one's going the other way.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's that counter
rotating field again.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.540 align:middle line:84%
They're mirror
images of each other.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:25.494 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the entire
configuration between a male

00:38:25.494 --> 00:38:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and a female when
they're actually

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:84%
facing each other like
this, one is a mirror image

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.060 align:middle line:90%
of the other one.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And when all of their points,
if you have a female facing

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
this way and then a
male is facing this way

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're facing each other,
all of their points line up.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Your chakra points
are in your body,

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.720 align:middle line:84%
but they're also on
the tips of here.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.200 align:middle line:84%
They're literally on the tips
of each one of these things,

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:90%
the eight basic chakras are.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And so when the two are
together and sexual union,

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.840 align:middle line:84%
these two fields are
lined up perfectly.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment if they both
ankh like that, what happens

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.870 align:middle line:84%
is the two fields
actually move together.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:90%
And the points all become one.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.730 align:middle line:84%
If you do this, you'll
find with your mate

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:84%
that when you're doing
that, that you will

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:90%
begin to come simultaneously.

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It begins to get easier
and easier and easier

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.569 align:middle line:84%
rather than just one person and
another person or something.

00:39:29.569 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
It actually becomes
a simultaneous thing.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:37.045 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.045 --> 00:39:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Is that with or
without ejaculation?

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>No, with ejaculation.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're Hindu,
you really worry about that.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you're Egyptian,
you go, you go for it.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.854 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.854 --> 00:39:55.805 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:39:55.805 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you ejaculate and you
do this, you bring it out.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:84%
You just bring it out
through the top of your head.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
You just took all that
energy and threw it

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:90%
in the garbage can.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.706 align:middle line:90%


00:40:10.706 --> 00:40:13.777 align:middle line:84%
You're making yourself
weaker and that's

00:40:13.777 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:90%
what the Hindus found out.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.310 align:middle line:84%
If you keep doing that,
it actually makes you old,

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.670 align:middle line:84%
it makes you weak and it's
not a good thing to do.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.630 align:middle line:84%
This is one more
aspect that's important

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.650 align:middle line:90%
when we talk about sexuality.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:33.080 align:middle line:84%
That this is assumed
that you're doing this.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:90%
And then there is another thing.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Assuming you're doing that and
you have all these other things

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and all this other
stuff known, you

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:50.280 align:middle line:84%
can connect not from your heart
up but you can connect down

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.340 align:middle line:90%
to the genitals.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you do,
there's a training

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.610 align:middle line:90%
that begins with three breaths.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is when
you feel the orgasm coming,

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.510 align:middle line:90%
you do the ankh.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:10.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the first breath.

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And you make these breaths as
deep and as long as possible.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Because you only have eight.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:23.060 align:middle line:84%
If you go [PANTS] all
your breaths, it's over.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand that
there's time involved in here.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.310 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.500 align:middle line:84%
When it comes up, you
take a really deep breath

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and you pull it all the
way up, let it go around.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And you still keep breathing
in, because as long

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
as you're breathing in, it's
flowing on breath number one.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're full,
you let it out very slowly.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Because it continues to pump
this prana into your system

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.880 align:middle line:90%
continuously.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So it you could have
either just a little bit

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.270 align:middle line:84%
into your system or you
could have massive amounts

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:56.690 align:middle line:90%
into your system.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you keep pumping it
in there until you can't.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're breathing
prana at that point.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's with the ankh.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But when you go to
breath number two,

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.880 align:middle line:90%
you still are breathing prana.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But you're now in
the merkaba field.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And you switch to what
you're familiar with.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Instead of doing this, you
instantly on the second breath,

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:84%
you send the energy down
and up to your heart chakra.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Same place, but
from above and from

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.586 align:middle line:84%
below bring it out
into the sphere,

00:42:39.586 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:84%
bring it out into
the big sphere,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and send it through the
entire merkaba field.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And it energizes another
level of your existence.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And also you want to
simultaneously see

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:84%
it being sent into the sphere
with all the beams of light.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty much a
brain thing at first.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:08.082 align:middle line:90%


00:43:08.082 --> 00:43:10.050 align:middle line:84%
The next thing they're
teaching me right there.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And then on the third breath
is this magical breath

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that I'm still trying
to learn how to do.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think I just
figured it out.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.770 align:middle line:90%
I'll know.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll understand
whether I know or not when

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.640 align:middle line:90%
I get there.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The next one, you don't
you do not breathe prana.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't pull prana
in with your intention.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.500 align:middle line:84%
You bring in void,
nothing, nothingness.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And so you're breathing void.

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And you bring it into the
sphere of this Leonardo sphere.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:48.890 align:middle line:84%
First from above and
below in polarity,

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.970 align:middle line:90%
just like you did before.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.710 align:middle line:90%
But you focus on here.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe in, but
then as soon as you do,

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.390 align:middle line:90%
immediately you switch.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:00.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how
to switch to a way

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.525 align:middle line:84%
where you're breathing
without polarity.

00:44:02.525 --> 00:44:05.730 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about that
for four years now or more.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:84%
How do you breathe
without polarity?

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The angel said you
will know you're

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.420 align:middle line:84%
doing it right because
you will float,

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.920 align:middle line:84%
you will break your
connection with gravity.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.750 align:middle line:84%
You'll float off the
ground about a foot

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and your body will begin
to glow in the darkness.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
all these saints

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.090 align:middle line:84%
are doing that are around
the world that are in caves.

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.870 align:middle line:90%
They're breathing void.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:40.930 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's necessary
to create is spirit and void.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the only two
things that are necessary.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And they may be the same.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But gravity is another
thing that seems

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.060 align:middle line:90%
to be associated with void.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:55.730 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have discovered
that they now have found out

00:44:55.730 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that the gravity, which is
everywhere in the same way

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:08.886 align:middle line:84%
that void is everywhere or the
vacuum, they've now found out,

00:45:08.886 --> 00:45:10.385 align:middle line:84%
and this would take
a lot to explain

00:45:10.385 --> 00:45:12.015 align:middle line:90%
and it would take a long time.

00:45:12.015 --> 00:45:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
doing, there's science

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that's coming out of Russia
right now supersedes everything

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.270 align:middle line:90%
on Earth that I'm aware of.

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
greater than this.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:31.160 align:middle line:90%


00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.660 align:middle line:84%
The gravity field is a
living being and it's alive.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.100 align:middle line:90%
It's conscious.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And they can
scientifically prove it.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:43.280 align:middle line:84%
They can communicate with it
and change gravity at will

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:84%
when they're in direct
communication with gravity.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And they know when they're
in connection with gravity,

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:84%
because they break
the gravity field

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:90%
and they float off the earth.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is the research that
they're doing over there.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.470 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:03.700 align:middle line:84%
The secret that lies, this
is what the angels keep

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.180 align:middle line:84%
telling me, the secret is
knowing how to breathe void

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.205 align:middle line:90%
without polarity.

00:46:08.205 --> 00:46:10.960 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.060 align:middle line:84%
That I've spent so much
time thinking about that.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's really hard to do.

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I went through a million
different configurations.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.555 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just now beginning
to understand because

00:46:24.555 --> 00:46:27.180 align:middle line:84%
of the plasma beings that are in
the earth that are teaching me

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.510 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:30.944 align:middle line:84%
They've now show me the
secret to all of this,

00:46:30.944 --> 00:46:33.110 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't been able to
actually get to the point

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.500 align:middle line:90%
where I can manifest it yet.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But at this point now
I feel like I know

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.380 align:middle line:90%
where I'm going to do this.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And then there's five
more breaths in here.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.640 align:middle line:90%
These are the first three.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Once you break the
bounds of gravity,

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.750 align:middle line:84%
then there are five more
breaths you can take.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And you're breathing
the elements.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.490 align:middle line:84%
You're breathing fire, then
earth, then water, then air.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And you go through
this particular stage

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and then you breathe them all
at once on the eighth one.

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
in that moment,

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.890 align:middle line:90%
you can create anything.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:07.735 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:47:07.735 --> 00:47:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Anything at all.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But it usually takes
three or more people

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to do that in conjunction
with each other.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But they say that I could
do this level by myself.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I'm working on.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling you
what I'm doing right now.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:28.907 align:middle line:84%
And after many years, I'm
finally getting to the place

00:47:28.907 --> 00:47:31.240 align:middle line:84%
where I think I understand
what the heck they're saying.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.960 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>What do you mean by polarity?

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>What do I mean by
polarity is what I said.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Positive and negative, male
and female, up and down,

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:46.780 align:middle line:90%
hot and cold.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:51.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're
not reading from here.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're breathing
from above and below,

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.257 align:middle line:90%
that's a polarity breath.

00:47:56.257 --> 00:47:58.090 align:middle line:84%
You're breathing from
this end and this end.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.930 align:middle line:90%
North and south, polarity.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:04.690 align:middle line:84%
If you're breathing from inside
and outside, that's polarity.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:08.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:14.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're breathing all from
outside going toward the end,

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.459 align:middle line:90%
it's still polarity.

00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're breathing
from the inside out,

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:20.210 align:middle line:90%
it's still polarity.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:24.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you do that?

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And I could never figure
out how I could even

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.840 align:middle line:84%
configure to make that
kind of breath yet.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And until recently, I
have a very good idea now.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.968 align:middle line:90%
We'll see what happens.

00:48:37.968 --> 00:48:38.467 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:38.467 --> 00:48:41.680 align:middle line:90%


00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Would that be
circular breathing?

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:47.590 align:middle line:90%


00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Circular breathing is probably
associated with it, but not

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.180 align:middle line:90%
in a circle.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.599 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:58.482 align:middle line:84%
I believe it is a
configuration that life uses.

00:48:58.482 --> 00:49:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Remember when I talked about
the golden mean rectangle, how

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.830 align:middle line:84%
it will go in forever
and out forever

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and that there's two universes,
but they're the same.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It's only when you can see
that male and female are not

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:12.290 align:middle line:90%
separate but they're one.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get the
opposites to be one and not two,

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:19.920 align:middle line:84%
then you're breathing
without polarity.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.500 align:middle line:90%


00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>You know how when you bringing
the breath in from the top,

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.850 align:middle line:84%
you imagine the energy and prana
coming in from the top and also

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:33.750 align:middle line:90%
from the bottom?

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.870 align:middle line:84%
What if you closed
off the bottom

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and you only brought the
energy in through the top?

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's the same
thing as like breathing,

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:48.830 align:middle line:84%
if you have a sphere
and you're trying

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.915 align:middle line:90%
to only come into the center.

00:49:50.915 --> 00:49:56.180 align:middle line:90%


00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.885 align:middle line:90%
It still isn't a unity breath.

00:49:57.885 --> 00:50:00.760 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.980 align:middle line:84%
There's still an
inside and an outside.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.139 align:middle line:84%
This is like your
body, only in this case

00:50:05.139 --> 00:50:06.180 align:middle line:90%
it's more like the earth.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.280 align:middle line:90%
But it's still your body.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.880 align:middle line:90%
I tried that.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.037 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:50:14.037 --> 00:50:15.468 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:15.468 --> 00:50:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.370 align:middle line:90%
I've tried a lot of things.

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:21.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's one of them too.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't seem to work.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
asking this question

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:35.880 align:middle line:84%
to the polarity beings, I mean
the polarity beings, the plasma

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.640 align:middle line:84%
beings, they were the
ones that showed me

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.126 align:middle line:90%
what I needed to know.

00:50:42.126 --> 00:50:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And where the inside of
the Earth is the stars.

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:49.460 align:middle line:84%
The inside is the outside and
the outside is the inside.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.290 align:middle line:84%
There is no difference
between them.

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:55.160 align:middle line:90%


00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Now that I see that that is
the reality, because there's

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.950 align:middle line:84%
no doubt in my mind,
because I was there.

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:04.600 align:middle line:90%
I went through it, I saw it.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Just as I've seen the outside,
I've now seen the inside.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And there is no difference
between male and female

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:14.150 align:middle line:90%
except in the way we perceive.

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It definitely makes a
difference in how you move.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:25.640 align:middle line:84%
If you try to move from
here from a spaceship

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.510 align:middle line:84%
off the surface
going into there,

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:32.340 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
to go great distances

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.030 align:middle line:84%
except by doing exactly
what we did in the earth,

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:37.560 align:middle line:90%
where you go into the stars.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.850 align:middle line:90%
You go right through the sun.

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
did this coming here,

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:84%
when I came here from Sirius,
I flew this huge ship.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.880 align:middle line:90%
I told you that.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into
a being that had

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.250 align:middle line:90%
been trained to fly the ship.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.800 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have to learn how.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So I just rolled into
this body, stood up.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.590 align:middle line:90%
I was 16 feet high.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:90%
And I just knew everything.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:01.830 align:middle line:90%
I just knew exactly what to do.

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the ship and I went,
oh yeah, I know what that is.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.948 align:middle line:84%
And I went down, sat down, and
there was all this paneling.

00:52:06.948 --> 00:52:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Knew what every
single thing was.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:10.460 align:middle line:90%
And we took off.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:90%
It took 400 people to fly this.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:16.045 align:middle line:84%
And we took off, we made
this big huge arc off

00:52:16.045 --> 00:52:21.350 align:middle line:84%
of Sirius, third planet out from
Sirius B. Made this arc around

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and came right at Sirius A and
went just as fast as we could.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Just right into the sun.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.070 align:middle line:90%
And right through the center.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And 90 seconds later, I
came out this star, our sun.

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So I traveled all the way from
Sirius to here in 90 seconds.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And it came out there and
slowed it way down and then went

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.280 align:middle line:84%
to Venus where I
began my training.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.250 align:middle line:90%


00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:55.190 align:middle line:84%
But I remember as I
was making that loop

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that that's the one thing
this body that I was using

00:52:58.830 --> 00:52:59.510 align:middle line:90%
didn't know.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:03.220 align:middle line:84%
It didn't actually
understand how it worked.

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It knew exactly
what to do, but it

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:08.710 align:middle line:84%
didn't understand the mechanism
of how flying into a sun

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:11.620 align:middle line:90%
would put you somewhere else.

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the plasma beings
had me do this consciously

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.070 align:middle line:84%
when I was in there,
a very similar thing.

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:19.660 align:middle line:90%
And I get it.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:20.880 align:middle line:90%
I get it now.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I understand it.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:22.810 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:27.240 align:middle line:90%


00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.225 align:middle line:90%
But I'm still learning.

00:53:29.225 --> 00:53:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the
more you learn,

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:37.740 align:middle line:90%
the more questions you got.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.814 align:middle line:90%
It just never seems to end.

00:53:39.814 --> 00:53:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>I just wanted to ask
you to explain more

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:46.980 align:middle line:84%
about the second type where
you send the energy out

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.140 align:middle line:90%
to your merkaba.

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Like how do you do it?

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Like do you connect--

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>This one?

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you connect with heart
chakra or you just go down

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.580 align:middle line:90%
and do your ankh?

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>This one is just Ankhing.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:59.700 align:middle line:90%
And we just explained that.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But on the very next
breath, with intention,

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:06.210 align:middle line:84%
you do what you do, where you
bring the prana from the two

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:middle line:90%
poles and meet it in here.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
radiates first the sphere

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:13.944 align:middle line:84%
and it goes out of the
sphere, you let it keep going.

00:54:13.944 --> 00:54:15.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't contain
it and anything.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.860 align:middle line:84%
You let it keep going through
all of your energy fields.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And around this field
here is a sphere exactly

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.870 align:middle line:90%
the width of the disk.

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And so if for you it's
about 54 feet or so.

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you want the
energy to expand

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:40.990 align:middle line:84%
from where it comes
almost from the center

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and then expand out into the
big sphere, this big one.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So it encompasses all
of your merkaba field.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:51.980 align:middle line:84%
We usually don't talk about
all this stuff out here.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.320 align:middle line:84%
We really pretty much talk
about the star tetrahedrons

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.630 align:middle line:90%
which are right in the center.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:58.500 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot more going on.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the entire
universe was created just

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:04.955 align:middle line:84%
by the images that are
inside that sphere.

00:55:04.955 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot stuff we
don't talk about either.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:12.285 align:middle line:90%


00:55:12.285 --> 00:55:19.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the external
field of the merkaba.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.885 align:middle line:84%
And it's shaped
like-- where is it?

00:55:23.885 --> 00:55:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there it is.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It's got a pentagon.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see hexagons
and pentagons.

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a pentagon on top,
pentagon on the bottom.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.770 align:middle line:84%
They're faced in
opposite directions.

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:38.631 align:middle line:84%
And that's the axis of
your breathing tube.

00:55:38.631 --> 00:55:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a sphere
that goes around here.

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:42.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the outer shell.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.560 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk about
these kind of forms,

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.509 align:middle line:84%
each individual
one of them, we're

00:55:47.509 --> 00:55:48.800 align:middle line:90%
only talking about the surface.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm just talking about
the surface of this thing.

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.120 align:middle line:84%
But internally, if you could see
all the lines moving in here,

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.170 align:middle line:84%
you can't even hardly
see through this.

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I've got one made out of
straws from McDonald's.

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.808 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:00.808 --> 00:56:03.243 align:middle line:90%


00:56:03.243 --> 00:56:04.661 align:middle line:90%
It's very cool though.

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:08.310 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.547 align:middle line:90%
There's 60 of these on here.

00:56:09.547 --> 00:56:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them
is a tetrahedron.

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And they start forming
these five pointed stars

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and six pointed stars that
go in toward the center.

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you get all the
lines of energy in there,

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:24.200 align:middle line:90%
it's like a solid ball almost.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.840 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
lines, you can barely

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.110 align:middle line:84%
find a place you
can look through.

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is the true energy
field of just this one shape.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And you've got thousands of
these shapes inside of here.

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And each one has a toroidal
field that's on it also.

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Got you've got a torus
that goes out from this.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.700 align:middle line:90%
It's even bigger.

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these toruses
inside of there, lots and lots

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:55.610 align:middle line:90%
and lots of them.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They're all aligned
except for the heart.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing
that is not aligned.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:02.535 align:middle line:84%
And when that orgasm happens,
the whole thing aligns

00:57:02.535 --> 00:57:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're all linked
together for the first time.

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We're in one
organized structure.

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:13.010 align:middle line:84%
That's all that's
missing in us is

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have our heart
aligned with everything else.

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I was talking about
sending the energy out,

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:35.950 align:middle line:84%
you're sending it radially out
like a sun in all directions

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:37.360 align:middle line:90%
to everything that's in here.

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know
what all that stuff is.

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Just intention goes out
through the entire thing.

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:45.980 align:middle line:90%
That's on the second breath.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But you also want to be
sure that it includes

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:51.810 align:middle line:84%
the beams of light and
all that stuff in there

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:56.480 align:middle line:84%
with your intention, because
that is a core aspect of this

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.100 align:middle line:90%
that's so important.

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the merkaba is
one thing it comes out there.

00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But the beams of
light and what goes on

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:09.850 align:middle line:84%
in the brain is a very
essential, primal aspect of all

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:11.900 align:middle line:84%
of this, even though
it looks different

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like
it's almost unrelated.

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:15.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not unrelated.

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:18.445 align:middle line:84%
It is directly
connected together.

00:58:18.445 --> 00:58:21.890 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.185 align:middle line:84%
You just let it just,
with your intention

00:58:26.185 --> 00:58:27.560 align:middle line:84%
to go throughout
all your fields.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
know what they are.

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.710 align:middle line:90%
It's just the intention.

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Go everywhere in my light body.

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.956 align:middle line:90%
And that's the second breath.

00:58:34.956 --> 00:58:37.205 align:middle line:84%
And the third breath is where
you don't breathe prana.

00:58:37.205 --> 00:58:39.340 align:middle line:90%
You breathe void.

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.010 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of a side thing.

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I know it's kind
of a side thing.

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you can do
this, everything else

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.130 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen,
follow behind for sure.

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:55.792 align:middle line:90%


00:58:55.792 --> 00:58:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I shouldn't have
talked about that.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:00.694 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should have just
not talked about that.

00:59:00.694 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:90%


00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd still like to ask
you a question about that.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Because you said
the other breaths

00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:09.710 align:middle line:90%
are related to the elements.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:12.232 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering if
you know about the kahuna

00:59:12.232 --> 00:59:13.690 align:middle line:84%
way of breathing,
like they breathe

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the elements in through their
skin, through their pore flaps?

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>All over the world
have different ideas.

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:23.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are involved
in breathing the elements.

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
have different ideas.

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Some think there's four,
some think there's five,

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.215 align:middle line:90%
but there's really six.

00:59:30.215 --> 00:59:31.090 align:middle line:90%
There's six elements.

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:38.260 align:middle line:90%


00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:41.640 align:middle line:84%
She was talking about
the kahunas, right?

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.697 align:middle line:84%
And the kahunas, she
was talking about them

00:59:44.697 --> 00:59:45.655 align:middle line:90%
breathing the elements.

00:59:45.655 --> 00:59:47.707 align:middle line:84%
She didn't get into
detail of what that was,

00:59:47.707 --> 00:59:49.540 align:middle line:84%
but she was talking
about them breathing it.

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And I just said that
all over the world,

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:56.410 align:middle line:84%
there are people who understand
the importance of breathing

00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:57.890 align:middle line:90%
the elements.

00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you're breathing fire,
you're not breathing flames.

01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:03.880 align:middle line:84%
You're breathing the
essence of what fire is.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're breathing earth,
you're obviously not

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:08.370 align:middle line:90%
putting dirt in your mouth.

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You're breathing the
essence of what that is.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe
the elements,

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
when you're creating
something big like a planet,

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
you want a planet to
appear out of nothing,

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.700 align:middle line:84%
it requires all of those
elements, all six elements

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to be involved in
that breathing process

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:30.580 align:middle line:90%
or you won't create anything.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.860 align:middle line:90%


01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>What are the six?

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:37.615 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, there's fire.

01:00:37.615 --> 01:00:40.270 align:middle line:90%


01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Fire is the tetrahedron.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:46.100 align:middle line:90%


01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.590 align:middle line:90%
The cube is Earth.

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Octahedron is air.

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Icosahedron is water.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And the pentagonal
dodecahedron is prana.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And what void is, is a sphere.

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And the sphere contains
all the other five elements

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:15.480 align:middle line:90%
in the surface.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:21.830 align:middle line:84%
All of those five
elements sit on this.

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
A sphere will contain
them perfectly.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.570 align:middle line:90%
They'll be on the surface.

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So void or nothing is
the key to all creation.

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And so all creation really
only requires void and spirit,

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.100 align:middle line:90%
those two things.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Spirit consciousness and
nothing can create anything.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing
contains everything.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But you can get more
precise, you might say,

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
by precisely not only
breathing just void in spirit,

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
but also bringing in
the other five elements

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.350 align:middle line:90%
through your breath.

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you do,
you're setting up

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
a vibration that is possible
for anything to take place.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:10.740 align:middle line:90%


01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't want to go
into the sequence right now.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Because we don't need it.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm feeling I'm
spending too much time down

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:21.440 align:middle line:90%
on that third lower sphere.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
We need to be in this one
and continue this process.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.750 align:middle line:90%


01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to the other
side of where we are right now,

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:31.960 align:middle line:90%
you're a master on this.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.376 align:middle line:90%
You know it inside and out.

01:02:33.376 --> 01:02:34.500 align:middle line:90%
You'll remember everything.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh god, yeah, here it is again.

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know
exactly what to do.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
However, no matter how
much of a master you are,

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
very quickly we're going to
be entering into experiences

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
that you've probably
never had before.

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.380 align:middle line:90%


01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
The speed at which the evolution
is going to be taking on

01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and the levels of
which it's going on.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:08.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go from here to
the highest level in existence.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know the
exact time, but I'm

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.979 align:middle line:84%
going to guess seven,
eight, nine years.

01:03:13.979 --> 01:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Which would normally
take the entire length

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
of a universe, usually billions
and billions and billions

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.530 align:middle line:90%
of years.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do this
like the speed of light.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's going
to be so fast.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:27.320 align:middle line:90%


01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And I can hardly wait.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
If you like motorcycles,
this is going to be better.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.265 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:35.265 --> 01:03:38.060 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do is let's
practice some of this stuff

01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:42.970 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into the real thing.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.290 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about it enough.

01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.331 align:middle line:90%
I think we need to begin.

01:03:46.331 --> 01:03:49.510 align:middle line:90%


01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:53.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's just practice.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.140 align:middle line:90%
All the way through it.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to turn this.

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:01.270 align:middle line:84%
You guys are going to
have your masks on.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to turn
this this way so I can get

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.030 align:middle line:90%
a reference of where I'm at.

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:15.810 align:middle line:90%


01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Through this part
here, I'm going

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.397 align:middle line:90%
to assume you're in your heart.

01:04:20.397 --> 01:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to go
into the heart right now.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
We'll do that when
we get outside.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But right now you've
left the brain.

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
You're in the heart.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You've found the tiny
place in the heart.

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
going to go through

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:37.557 align:middle line:84%
from what happens when
you get to the tiny place

01:04:37.557 --> 01:04:38.140 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.340 align:middle line:90%


01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming you're in
the tiny place of your heart.

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:46.610 align:middle line:84%
At which point you
now put your tongue

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:51.220 align:middle line:84%
on the roof of your mouth
and find that little spot

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.450 align:middle line:90%
and begin massaging it.

01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:55.450 align:middle line:90%


01:04:55.450 --> 01:05:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you might suck it
out a little bit, pull it out.

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Not with a clicking sound, but
just right before you click,

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
that pressure you pull on
the roof of your mouth.

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Pull it out and began to
massage that little place.

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
You actually can massage
that place for, I would say,

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
at least 10 minutes,
five to 10 minutes,

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
before you even
bother doing anything.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing's going to
happen that quick, usually.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Once you have done
this a while, you

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.870 align:middle line:90%
can make this happen very fast.

01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But usually it's going
to take a little while.

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
You begin massaging this
place in your mouth.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And again, you don't need to do
anything else for a little bit,

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
because it takes
time for this energy

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.870 align:middle line:90%
to build and become sensitive.

01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
But when you feel that
it's becoming sensitive,

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
then that's when you know
you're in the tiny space

01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.870 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:01.420 align:middle line:90%
You know where you are.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
But you bring your attention
up to the pineal gland.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And then with your
intention, you

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
tell it to look to
that place that's

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
way up above your
other eyes up higher.

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:20.385 align:middle line:84%
And you have it rotate the
eye and look in the direction

01:06:20.385 --> 01:06:21.100 align:middle line:90%
of that opening.

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.706 align:middle line:90%


01:06:24.706 --> 01:06:25.830 align:middle line:90%
That's with your intention.

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing you do.

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Then you move your intention
to the pineal chakra,

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
which is just a tiny bit
of space in front of it.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And you then see the pituitary
chakra in front of you.

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:48.300 align:middle line:90%
You find it.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.230 align:middle line:90%
It's in front of you.

01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:51.769 align:middle line:90%
The eye has been rotated.

01:06:51.769 --> 01:06:53.060 align:middle line:90%
It's looking in that direction.

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.152 align:middle line:90%


01:06:56.152 --> 01:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
position, you continue

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to look at the pituitary chakra
until you see the green light.

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't go any further
until you see the green light.

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:13.490 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can do.

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Your alpha is not strong enough.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.140 align:middle line:84%
What you can do while
you're doing this

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.230 align:middle line:90%
is think happy thoughts.

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:22.490 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like Peter Pan.

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:25.330 align:middle line:90%
It's the way he was able to fly.

01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:26.150 align:middle line:90%
How do you fly?

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:28.370 align:middle line:90%
You think happy thoughts.

01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And seriously,
really, you can start

01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:33.890 align:middle line:84%
thinking about someone you
love while you're doing this

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
or you can just feel joy.

01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Anything that makes you
happy and feel happy.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a cookie for you.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
That makes you feel
happier, you've

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:53.542 align:middle line:84%
just increased the
chances that the alpha

01:07:53.542 --> 01:07:54.750 align:middle line:90%
is going to be strong enough.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:57.500 align:middle line:90%


01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But just feeling someone
that you really love

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:06.510 align:middle line:90%
is a very powerful one.

01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And then there's nothing
you can do at this point

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
but continue the
process with the tongue,

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:16.859 align:middle line:84%
knowing you're in the
tiny space of the heart,

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:22.569 align:middle line:84%
and looking from the pineal
chakra to the pituitary chakra.

01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have to wait
till the light comes.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's say the
light comes now.

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:29.620 align:middle line:90%
And the light appears.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:33.649 align:middle line:84%
And then there's still
nothing you can do.

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But you realize that the
alpha is strong enough

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.430 align:middle line:90%
and that it's going to happen.

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:38.270 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Once the green light
appears, it will happen.

01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of time.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And so you get prepared.

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:46.071 align:middle line:84%
You know that is
now going to happen.

01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:47.529 align:middle line:84%
And then what's
going to happen, it

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
may take another five minutes
or something like that,

01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:51.130 align:middle line:90%
or who knows.

01:08:51.130 --> 01:08:54.289 align:middle line:84%
And then this thing is going
to do this amazing thing where

01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:56.450 align:middle line:84%
it turns into a
spiral or it turns

01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.930 align:middle line:84%
into concentric circles
or concentric squares

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
or it becomes a tube
or maybe something

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:03.290 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen before.

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But you will know
that what's happened,

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.069 align:middle line:84%
it's a really strong feeling
when this takes place

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that you know something
amazing is taking place.

01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:15.510 align:middle line:90%
And it happens.

01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And so once it happens in
the spiral goes in there

01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and links with the
other one, then all

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
it takes is the intention
to look through that chakra

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
to the one that is outside of
your head and link with it.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:32.300 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy to do that.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:37.170 align:middle line:84%
That's not one that
stops anybody ever.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But once you connect all the
way through, then that's it.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
You can then drop your
attention on the brain

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:49.560 align:middle line:84%
altogether and bring
your attention down

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.370 align:middle line:90%
to this tiny space of the heart.

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:56.740 align:middle line:90%


01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Except that you must
continue the tongue moving.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.890 align:middle line:90%
And now you've done that.

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
You then either use
intention or not.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:14.890 align:middle line:84%
If you use intention, then you
intend for something to happen.

01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And you see and sense
and feel the images

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.310 align:middle line:90%
associated with that.

01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:24.950 align:middle line:90%


01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And then once you see it
and you feel what it is,

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:31.700 align:middle line:90%
a knowing comes.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to say it.

01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:37.630 align:middle line:90%
You just know that it's done.

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:39.660 align:middle line:90%
At which point it's over.

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.820 align:middle line:90%
You can drop the tongue.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
You can do anything
else like that.

01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:43.640 align:middle line:84%
You either come out
of the meditation

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
or you can go in and just stay
there and keep meditating or do

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:49.830 align:middle line:90%
something entirely different.

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
But the creation process of
what you just did is done.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:59.836 align:middle line:84%
It is not complex once you
understood what's going on.

01:10:59.836 --> 01:11:07.644 align:middle line:90%


01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:12.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can take your
masks off now for a moment.

01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I wanted you go through it
with your masks on so you could

01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:18.810 align:middle line:84%
go with the sensation
of the feelings of what

01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:21.704 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

01:11:21.704 --> 01:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
what happened when

01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:26.960 align:middle line:90%
I was in the chamber with him.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.810 align:middle line:90%


01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:34.399 align:middle line:84%
On the fourth day or
fifth day of this work,

01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and Claudette was with me
going through this too.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.920 align:middle line:90%


01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hart confided
in me that he was

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.410 align:middle line:90%
about to lose everything he had.

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:50.300 align:middle line:90%


01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
At 5 o'clock that evening,
he was going to go bankrupt.

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And he had to go to the bank
and sign these documents

01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and he lost everything.

01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened was they
created, using the secret,

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
the brain function,
they have been

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:07.570 align:middle line:84%
able to prove that that's
true scientifically.

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I talked about the
negative side effect coming

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
from we don't see,
he goes, yeah,

01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:15.100 align:middle line:90%
we're figuring that one out now.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was they went in

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and they used the brain to
create so that he could make

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:26.250 align:middle line:90%
a whole system up in Canada.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And when he did, this guy came
in and gave him all this money.

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And he went out and took
that money and a bunch

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
of other money and bought
this land up in Canada so

01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:41.520 align:middle line:90%
that they could own the land.

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But he went way out
on a limb to do this.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So he was financially
vulnerable.

01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:50.230 align:middle line:90%


01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the dark side came in
from the back and the guy who

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to give them
the final $1.5 million

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.485 align:middle line:84%
dollars, which would have
paid off all of his bills

01:12:57.485 --> 01:13:01.455 align:middle line:84%
and everything like that,
was taken by the IRS

01:13:01.455 --> 01:13:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and all his assets were frozen.

01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:06.760 align:middle line:90%
And so no money.

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.580 align:middle line:90%
He was out.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.510 align:middle line:90%
he was going to lose everything.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So he said to me, I understand
what you're doing now,

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.140 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know how to do it.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.910 align:middle line:90%
He says, can we do that?

01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, something like
this will take three people.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And so Claudette
went in one chamber,

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I went another chamber, and Dr.
Hart went into another chamber.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:28.005 align:middle line:84%
And then I was the one that
was going to do the dreaming.

01:13:28.005 --> 01:13:32.790 align:middle line:90%


01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So I just went in there and
once I set everything up

01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
with all the stuff that
we're talking about,

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
then I saw the image of somebody
coming in and saving him

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.120 align:middle line:90%
kind of at the last minute.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the images came
in of these things being

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.070 align:middle line:90%
formed all over the place.

01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:57.650 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of interesting
watching what was happening.

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:58.920 align:middle line:90%
I was letting God do it.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was watching more
stuff was coming in

01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things,
I was watching all this.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.165 align:middle line:84%
And then at the very
end there was this image

01:14:06.165 --> 01:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
that was just thrown in there
which seemed pretty random.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It was that Dr. Hart was going
to go on Larry King Live.

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:18.396 align:middle line:90%


01:14:18.396 --> 01:14:20.384 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:20.384 --> 01:14:21.880 align:middle line:90%


01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So I went back and after
we came out of that,

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:27.480 align:middle line:90%
I told Dr. Hart the whole thing.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, this
is what I saw.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end I
said, looks like you're

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.300 align:middle line:90%
going to go on Larry King Live.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.490 align:middle line:90%
He goes, are you kidding me?

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
I said no.

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:middle line:90%
This is what it said.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was he
went to the bank at 5

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.300 align:middle line:90%
o'clock that night.

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
He said he was down, the pen
was heading to the paper.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And this person broke through
the doors and said no, no.

01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:54.682 align:middle line:84%
He says, I know
what's happening here

01:14:54.682 --> 01:14:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going
to let it happen.

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And he flops down a check
a million and a half bucks

01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:00.210 align:middle line:90%
on the table.

01:15:00.210 --> 01:15:02.450 align:middle line:84%
He says, this will
cover everything.

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And then that night
when he was asleep

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and he hadn't had a
chance to even talk to me,

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.500 align:middle line:84%
somebody calls them
him Holland and said,

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I've been watching
you for years.

01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:13.299 align:middle line:84%
And I've got six and a half
million bucks or something

01:15:13.299 --> 01:15:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and I want one of
these over here.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And then right after that,
the next day, the guy

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.847 align:middle line:90%
from Mexico calls.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:19.680 align:middle line:90%
And it just started.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.536 align:middle line:90%
It was really weird.

01:15:20.536 --> 01:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
It was just coming
from everywhere now.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.880 align:middle line:90%


01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And so Dr. Hart told me,
he says, well, it worked.

01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
At least something worked,
because I was saved.

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going bankrupt
and I got everything.

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:40.990 align:middle line:84%
But about three or four
months later, Larry King Live

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:42.340 align:middle line:90%
calls him up.

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:45.920 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] They come out,
they filmed the whole thing,

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.300 align:middle line:90%
and he goes on Larry King Live.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.400 align:middle line:90%
It actually happened.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And that was the piece.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
reason my heart did

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
that was the other things
you could say, well,

01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:59.360 align:middle line:90%
that's coincidence.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.210 align:middle line:90%
That's coincidence.

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
But that's just too
much to be coincidence.

01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:08.779 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It was like, oh,
yeah, well try this one.

01:16:08.779 --> 01:16:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:14.270 align:middle line:90%


01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
just about ready.

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:22.266 align:middle line:90%
Ah, oh, E, I, O, U. Sometimes Y.

01:16:22.266 --> 01:16:24.706 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:24.706 --> 01:16:30.090 align:middle line:90%


01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:32.565 align:middle line:90%
Losing control of my voice.

01:16:32.565 --> 01:16:40.930 align:middle line:90%


01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to try this
on your own one time

01:16:45.610 --> 01:16:46.970 align:middle line:90%
without me saying anything?

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:48.728 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:16:48.728 --> 01:16:50.165 align:middle line:90%
>>No?

01:16:50.165 --> 01:16:52.081 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:52.081 --> 01:16:55.440 align:middle line:90%


01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Well then in that case,
let's go out to the land.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And I will talk you
all the way through it.

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:08.680 align:middle line:90%


01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just go
through the whole thing.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.640 align:middle line:84%
But all you can do
is get to that place

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.310 align:middle line:90%
with the green light.

01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
get the green light,

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.260 align:middle line:90%
you can't go any further.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But if you do get
the green light,

01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and what I've found in the
past is 30 to maybe 40% of you

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.740 align:middle line:84%
will get the green light,
and maybe more this time,

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:31.640 align:middle line:84%
because there's 51 people that's
already been in the heart.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
You guys can go all
the way after that.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that,
you know what to do.

01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Once you see the
green light, it links.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And then all you do is just
look through to the other one.

01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:45.160 align:middle line:84%
That links and then bam, you
just go down to your heart.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Keep the tongue going
and everything's now

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:48.090 align:middle line:90%
done inside the heart.

01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:50.980 align:middle line:90%


01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Here we are walking out into
the beautiful nature of Sedona

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and her red rocks that seem
to be reaching to the clouds,

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.930 align:middle line:84%
about to have our final
meditation with our group.

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:02.760 align:middle line:84%
People are excited, not only
because of the natural beauty,

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.650 align:middle line:84%
but because of our
inner beauty that

01:18:04.650 --> 01:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
becomes so obvious once we enter
the sacred space of our heart.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
As we come to the
completion of our workshop,

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.380 align:middle line:84%
we can reflect on
the stages of growth

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.210 align:middle line:90%
that we have experienced.

01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:19.880 align:middle line:84%
On the first day, we began to
realize how powerful love is

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and how we become weak
when we enter into fear.

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But with love, we
can change the world.

01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And Claudette's Blue
School opened our heart

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to our human potential.

01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:32.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, she showed us our
ability to see spherically,

01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:34.780 align:middle line:90%
and it was only the beginning.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
On the second day, we learned
that we could heal anything,

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:40.710 align:middle line:84%
any human disease, and
talked about masters

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:43.115 align:middle line:84%
as they performed what
seemed to be miracles.

01:18:43.115 --> 01:18:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But really it is just
science and it is something

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that all of us can
do if we only focus.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Then we began to heal each
other in an experience that

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.761 align:middle line:84%
not only healed many
people who were present,

01:18:54.761 --> 01:18:56.760 align:middle line:84%
but the experience will
stay within their hearts

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.930 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
On the third day,
we entered the mind

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.715 align:middle line:84%
to realize the
nature of the brain

01:19:02.715 --> 01:19:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and its possible intimate
relationship with the heart.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.120 align:middle line:84%
We learned to activate
our pineal gland

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and open our beams of
light around our head,

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:13.348 align:middle line:84%
preparing the connection to
link the heart to the brain.

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:22.330 align:middle line:90%


01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
On day four, the door
of knowledge opened wide

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and we learned,
or more accurately

01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:29.930 align:middle line:84%
we remembered, the
inner science ascension.

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
We reconnected
our beams of light

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
coming from our
pineal gland and then

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
we reconnected our heart to our
brain and opened our third eye,

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.840 align:middle line:84%
makeup it possible
to dream a new dream.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Finally, on this,
the last day, we

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.630 align:middle line:84%
studied the tantra of the
heart, the use of sexual energy

01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
with the creation
process and exactly

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
how to create from the
tiny space of the heart.

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Now we are ready to truly
begin to ascend into the higher

01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:56.900 align:middle line:90%
worlds of consciousness.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.650 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do
now is to practice.

01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:01.708 align:middle line:84%
So the meditation
becomes a natural part

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:03.430 align:middle line:90%
of your consciousness.

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:06.382 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:20:06.382 --> 01:20:21.634 align:middle line:90%


01:20:21.634 --> 01:20:24.220 align:middle line:84%
You who are watching
this film, I

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
wish to thank you for having
the courage to something

01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that is so outside of
national consciousness.

01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And my prayer is that
you also remember

01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
the truth of your
existence, begin

01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.380 align:middle line:84%
to breathe from your
tiny space of your heart,

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and to remember your intimate
connection to the source

01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:41.130 align:middle line:90%
of all life everywhere.

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Without even knowing you,
I can say I love you.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.300 align:middle line:90%
For you are me and I am you.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Trust in yourself.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Stay connected to mother
earth and father sun

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and you will find your
way through the darkness

01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
of this world into the
brilliant light of the new world

01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:57.000 align:middle line:90%
that you will create.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
In Lak'ech, from
my heart to yours.

01:20:59.050 --> 01:21:05.950 align:middle line:90%


01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:09.000 align:middle line:90%
