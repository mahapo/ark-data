00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going
into the Blue School.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're going
to do these exercises.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And this is the lowest level.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the only level
they let me work on.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle line:84%
It's considered
their lowest level,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's really great
for what we're doing.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:84%
It's preparation for inner
dimensional experience.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's just the
beginning of this,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
then they go deeper in
a different kind of way.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we're-- I'm going to
sit down while we do this.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:90%
You-- there's certain rules.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
play it like a game.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, don't
get serious about it.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- there's going to
be no tests or flunks in here.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And so just figure-- when we
actually go into this thing,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:84%
you have to have your
feet flat on the ground.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:84%
You can't cross anything,
not even your eyes, nothing.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You have to totally be feet
flat and your hands like this.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And your back is
straight as you can get.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't even
be touching the back.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
You should be-- your
back should be straight.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is just
in the exercise.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:84%
The moment I said, OK, open your
eyes, you could, if you want.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just during the exercise.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
strict about that.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.773 align:middle line:84%
And let's see what
else there is.

00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, I forgot one
more thing to talk about.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I got to talk about
something first.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:90%
It's about seeing.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when
they close their eyes,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:84%
people will say,
well, I can't see.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:90%
All I see is black.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:90%
I can't see anything.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Claudette's response
was, well, can you dream.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever dreamed?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, 10 years ago.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Then she just
followed you can see.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, we all can see,
but, a lot of times,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:90%
we think we can't.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you just have to
relax and just let go.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And, again, play it like
a little-- like a game,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
like you're a little
child and don't worry.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm going to
do two different tests

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:90%
to see if you-- how you do see.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I want to identify
if there's people--

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
there are people who
can't see, but they can,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know they can.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to identify
those people is

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:90%
what I'm trying to do.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And there are four
ways of seeing.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
One is male, one is
female, one is both,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:90%
and one is neutral or neither.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And this male, female,
both, and neutral

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
is a pattern that goes
throughout all chemistry

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and all throughout all kinds
of other levels of reality.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But the male way
of seeing is very

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:90%
different than the female way.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was talking about
that spectrum thing before,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of the same.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.605 align:middle line:84%
You have the male
here on this end,

00:03:28.605 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:90%
and the female on this end.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you tell a male to--
say we're doing guided imagery

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.508 align:middle line:90%
and I say see an apple.

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:84%
If it's a pure male,
which doesn't exist,

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and neither does
the pure female,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:84%
we're all partly
male and female mixed

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:84%
together at different levels,
but if-- but a pure male,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
if you told them to see an
apple, they close their eyes

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and there would
be an apple there.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.496 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be
just like looking

00:04:00.496 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:90%
at television or something.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:90%
There would be an apple.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.818 align:middle line:84%
They could rotate it and
they could turn it this way.

00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:84%
They could dissect it and do
all kinds of things with it.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But males are very, very, very,
very, very, very, very visual.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a female on
the other side, pure female,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and you ask her to see an
apple, nothing appears.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Nada, just nothing.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But she can feel and sense the
apple there that she can't see.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And she could tell you
everything about that apple.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:84%
She could go on for
hours about that apple.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
She could tell you what it
tastes, where it came from,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and who grew it, and
on and on and on,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:90%
anything that you can think of.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:90%
But she's not seeing an apple.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
There isn't anything there.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of us are
somewhere in the middle.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you're more male,
you're going to be more visual.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And the more female
you are, the more

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be just
sensing and feeling things.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But, usually, there's
a lot of people

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.885 align:middle line:84%
in the middle that can
kind of see an apple,

00:05:04.885 --> 00:05:07.019 align:middle line:84%
they kind of sense, and
they can kind of feel.

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But you put all
those things together

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and you come up with information
about whatever you're

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:90%
looking at.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you got to
trust yourself.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
If I say see something and
you don't see anything,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:90%
you go, oh, I failed.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- I didn't do it.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Just realize that you
may be seeing more

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:84%
toward the female
side, at which point,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
if you don't see something,
then sense it, feel it.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Become sensitive in another way.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds of ways and
we mix all those things together

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to come up with our-- what
we believe what we're seeing.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really
true in this imagery work

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.883 align:middle line:90%
that we're about to do.

00:05:46.883 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, I think we're ready.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing you
need is a pencil and paper.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:84%
One, two, I think
we're only going

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
to do two tests and
four or five examples.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And so each time you write
about a little paragraph

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
on what-- you're going to write
down what-- what you saw, felt,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:90%
experienced.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:90%
The other

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Thing is I'm going to--
I'm going to put us

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:90%
into the imagery work.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:84%
When I ask you to come out--
open your eyes and come out,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and these things are short.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
They're usually only a minute
to maybe three minutes long.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:90%
They're not very long usually.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And-- but we spend a
long time afterwards.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when you come out, do not
talk to anyone and don't think.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.202 align:middle line:84%
Before you even
think-- don't think,

00:06:58.202 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
start thinking
about what happened,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Write it down.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Just write down what
you saw and happened,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and try to write it without
changing anything, whatever

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
your first impression is.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.260 align:middle line:84%
If you saw a red car
and you start thinking,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe it was--
maybe-- maybe it was maroon.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the red.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your first indication
is is almost always the truth.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Because what's
going on is your ego

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
is in there going
I don't like red.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I like maroon.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Make it maroon.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it changes everything
and it isn't true.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I want
you to write everything

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
down that experienced
as cleanly as possible.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
After you've got it in words,
then you can think about it

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and talk to somebody
else if you want.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't change
what's on the paper.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we're
doing it this way.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So with the paper and
pencil, put it down

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
on the ground or somewhere,
so it's not a distraction,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.936 align:middle line:84%
but where you can get
to it very quickly.

00:08:11.936 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll-- and
then we start, we begin,

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.143 align:middle line:84%
we go very straight with our
spines, feet on the ground,

00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
just like that, and
close your eyes.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
If you-- you have
your masks, right?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I think-- this is an ongoing
debate between me and my wife,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
but I believe that
the mask is better.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:90%
She thinks it isn't.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But I really do,
for my things here.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Light affects your
pineal gland and when

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to shut
it down to get into,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:90%
you want to be totally dark.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you don't even
want light on your skin,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.938 align:middle line:84%
but mostly through your
eyes is the biggest one.

00:08:52.938 --> 00:08:54.854 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.854 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You might as well get
used to it because we're

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.769 align:middle line:84%
going to be using these
things all the time now.

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.345 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:09:04.345 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to begin
with two tests.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to write these
ones-- these two tests down.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
So everybody put your masks on.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Put your hands on
your knees, your feet

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:90%
flat, your back straight.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.656 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to go.

00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Now just relax.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.853 align:middle line:84%
And if you need to cough
or anything, do it now.

00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:40.064 align:middle line:90%
[COUGHING]

00:09:40.064 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Boy, you've been waiting for
that for 10 minutes probably.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Now just breathe gently.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.004 align:middle line:84%
Try to breathe
rhythmically right now,

00:09:58.004 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:84%
where you're breathing
the same length of time

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:90%
in as you're bringing out.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about seven
seconds in or anything.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It could be two seconds
in, but keep the time

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
that you're breathing in
the same as whatever time

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:90%
you're exhaling.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.903 align:middle line:84%
And try to get into a
rhythm with this breathing.

00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
In your inner imagination, see
the number three glowing bright

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:90%
in front of you.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.258 align:middle line:90%
Just the best you can.

00:10:36.258 --> 00:10:40.365 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.365 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Now feel yourself beginning
to move toward this--

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:84%
this number three, by the way,
represents the holy trinity.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And so feel yourself moving
toward this number three

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and getting closer, and
closer, and closer, and closer,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:84%
until you move right through
it to the other side.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Now see the number two glowing
bright in front of you.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:90%
It stands for duality.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Now start moving toward that one
and getting closer, and closer,

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
and closer, and closer.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And now move right through
it to the other side.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Now see the number one, tall
and bright, in front of you.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:90%
It stands for unity and oneness.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself
moving toward this one,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
also getting closer,
and closer, and closer.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Only this time, don't
move through it.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.724 align:middle line:84%
Move right into the
column of light.

00:11:43.724 --> 00:11:49.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
In your imagination,
move both arms

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:84%
straight out on
both sides of you.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.968 align:middle line:90%
And feel them straight out.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Now see your arms growing
longer until they go all the way

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and touch a wall.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And some of you are right
next to a wall, so you're

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.290 align:middle line:90%
going to be close to it.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.623 align:middle line:84%
But your other arm has to go
all the way across the room

00:12:15.623 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:90%
to touch another wall.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So see your arms
touching both walls.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Now see that your
head and your neck

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
is growing longer and longer
till your head goes all the way

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:90%
up and touches the ceiling.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.244 align:middle line:84%
You're getting all these
strange shapes now.

00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.563 align:middle line:84%
In your imagination, turn your
head to the left 90 degrees.

00:12:48.563 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, in your imagination,
turn it straight ahead again.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And now turn 90
degrees to the right,

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:90%
and then back straight again.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.604 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.604 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Now let your arms go
right through the walls

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and go about-- oh, maybe 100
meters, about 300 feet or so,

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.167 align:middle line:84%
a football field, out
on either side of you.

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.136 align:middle line:84%
And reach down and touch
the texture on the ground.

00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.436 align:middle line:84%
Now move your arms all
the way to the horizon,

00:13:39.436 --> 00:13:40.727 align:middle line:90%
like you're holding the planet.

00:13:40.727 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.382 align:middle line:84%
Now touch the texture of
this distant landscape.

00:13:49.382 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
When you can feel this
texture, open your eyes

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and seeing yourself
enormous and huge arms.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:11.336 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.336 --> 00:14:14.196 align:middle line:84%
When it feels complete,
just remove your mask.

00:14:14.196 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
This is just a test, so
it doesn't mean anything.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.802 align:middle line:84%
How many people-- how many
people could not do this?

00:14:35.802 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.576 align:middle line:90%
6, 7 people.

00:14:43.576 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Just with you over here,
could you do any of it

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:90%
or could you not be out

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>I became to where I
can't visually see it,

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:84%
but in my mind's
eye, I played it out.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like I
sort of might have

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:84%
done it, but for the actual
colors and visualization

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.650 align:middle line:90%
and things like that, no.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>But you-- but
you could kind of

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:84%
feel like you could feel
your arms getting longer,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:90%
but you couldn't see it, right?

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, I would have short mental
gargled pictures in my mind,

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:90%
but not vivid.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>That's all right.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And were you-- were you the--
who was the other person?

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know if it's
because I was tired,

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't stay
with the conversation.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I was having trouble staying
with you and I couldn't

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.386 align:middle line:90%
remember--

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>I understand.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>I would see a color, and then
I would get into the color,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't remember,
well, now what's going on.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought am I
supposed to put my hands out.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I just kept getting so confused.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I could see my hands
going out to the side,

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.904 align:middle line:84%
and then I put my
hands down because I

00:15:56.904 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
knew they weren't supposed
to be going out this way,

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:90%
but I was just so confused.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:90%
I saw a lot of color.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, we're at about
4,500 feet right here.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been here, it's
this is your third day or more,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're coming from
a lower atmosphere,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
like the ocean or
somewhere, you're

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
going to get sleepy
for a little while.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it happens to be
while the workshop's going on.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It takes about, I think,
another three days or so.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
your energy kicks back in.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>I came from Palm Springs.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
That's about as low as
you can get in the desert.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>So but I am-- I
was just really--

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was having trouble,
before we took the break,

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I was having difficulty
staying awake.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I just kept nodding, and--

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>I know.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:90%
It is a problem.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
The last school I had
was at 8,500 feet.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
People would come there
and just literally

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:90%
drop over, just on the floor.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Are you home?

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.526 align:middle line:90%
They don't answer.

00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It really affects
at that one, but--

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>But the numbers,
I got real clear.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I could see the numbers.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:90%
No, you're doing fine.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:90%
You're just tired is all.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, on top of that,
you've got a lot of people

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:90%
here with jet lag.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So we just have
to deal with this.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Usually, I'm the one
with the jet lag.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:90%
And they don't.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm up here just barely
able to keep my eyes open.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not worried about
either one of you actually.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.805 align:middle line:90%
Who's--

00:17:40.805 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>I was seeing-- I was
almost seeing-- I mean,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:90%
I had to imagine it.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.086 align:middle line:84%
Like, I couldn't just see it
and I couldn't see the numbers.

00:17:50.086 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I started seeing
geometric shapes and they

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:84%
were black and blue,
like it was black--

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.161 align:middle line:90%
>>That's OK.

00:17:57.161 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.249 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:17:59.249 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not a problem.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to see
what I tell you to see.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
This is another
part of the school,

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of interesting.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You get the instructions,
and you may--

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
your body may do something
totally different.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
problem with that at all.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the body knows
what it's doing.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And so you might say do
something, put your arms out,

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and instead, your head goes up
or something else like that.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:84%
That's-- those kind of
things are all right.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one that
is really interesting to me.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people you
say close your eyes

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing they
remember is open your eyes.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And they don't remember
anything in the middle at all.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And they-- they tell me that
that's the highest form of all.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:90%
What do I know?

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.240 align:middle line:90%
You

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So if I-- if I see that going
on, you don't worry about it.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.864 align:middle line:84%
They are going where
they're supposed to go,

00:18:57.864 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing everything
they're supposed to do.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:84%
They just don't remember
what it is and it's OK.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.605 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
another test and then

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.313 align:middle line:90%
we're going to go forward.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:12.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.222 align:middle line:90%
Put on the darkness.

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep inhale and blow
out through a small hole

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.528 align:middle line:84%
in your lips and see a
white mist coming out.

00:19:30.528 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Take another breath, and
either see, or sense,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:43.300 align:middle line:84%
or feel this white mist
coming out of your lips.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Now look into the black
field with your eyes closed

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and see a point of
light that seems

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:90%
to be at a great distance.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.570 align:middle line:84%
You can either see it,
or you can sense it,

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:90%
or you can feel it.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Now feel yourself being
drawn to this point of light,

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that you're moving toward it,
or it's moving toward you.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
See yourself getting
closer and closer to it.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And as you get
closer, watch to see

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.396 align:middle line:90%
how the light changes color.

00:20:20.396 --> 00:20:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:90%
And what is its color?

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.856 align:middle line:84%
Identify-- if it's many
colors, choose one.

00:20:34.856 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Now as you get really
close, let this color

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:90%
fill your field of view.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.365 align:middle line:84%
See yourself all around
it, or within it.

00:20:54.365 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Now don't try to
think on this one.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Now see the opposite color in
your body, whatever that means.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.730 align:middle line:84%
When you see and know both
colors, open your eyes.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.605 align:middle line:90%
Take off your mask.

00:21:21.605 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Same question.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Who could not do this?

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.688 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:21:44.688 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.693 align:middle line:90%
That was 10 people.

00:21:55.693 --> 00:22:01.657 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.657 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try this in
a slightly different way.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Of these 10 people, how
many of those 10 people

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
could originally see, or a
sense, or feel a point of light

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:90%
at a great distance?

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:90%
You could.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:22.834 align:middle line:90%
You could.

00:22:22.834 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, everyone else, I'm
not worried about you guys.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.831 align:middle line:84%
The other-- that leaves
about four or five.

00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Those other ones, you could
not see the point of light

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
at all, right, or
sense, or feel anything?

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So of those eight people, did
you see absolutely nothing?

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Nothing happened at all, it
was blackness the whole time.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.061 align:middle line:84%
The people that were
just saying that they

00:22:53.061 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
don't have any sensing
going on, because if they

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.976 align:middle line:84%
have sensing going on,
then it's just as good.

00:22:56.976 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a lot of
feminine way of sensing things,

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:84%
you may never see anything
through this whole thing.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Just really nothing
shows up, but yet you

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
can go on and on and on
about what happened there.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:90%
But it's not from seeing.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It's from other parts of
you that are coming forth.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So if there-- I want to know
now that the people that feel

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't see,
sense, or feel anything.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, that got you.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.180 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.342 align:middle line:90%
You didn't feel anything?

00:23:43.342 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Didn't sense anything,
didn't feeling anything,

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.008 align:middle line:90%
nothing happened?

00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>I try to imagine a light,
but I still could not

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:90%
see it, even in my imagination.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you talked about
colors, nothing, just black.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Could not imagine.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometime-- most of the time, I
don't see, but I can imagine.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But this time, I could
not even imagine colors.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Let me see the hands again
of those people, so I can see.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.649 align:middle line:90%
It's you, and you.

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.064 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:24:16.064 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to actually
do the real thing now.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.545 align:middle line:84%
This is about as much
as I can-- information

00:24:20.545 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I can gather right now.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
do the real thing.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, remember, if
I say see something,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:90%
it means see, sense, or feel.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And so just because
you don't see anything

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that you aren't
connected to the experience

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Do we keep the
eyes open inside?

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>You want the eyes closed
under the mask, not open.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It isn't-- you can't do
it with your eyes open.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it has to do
with the pineal gland.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.317 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland, the
darker it is, the better it is.

00:25:01.317 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
But there is a difference.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.834 align:middle line:84%
If you go home and
experiment with these masks

00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and see the
difference when you're

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
meditating with your eyes
open or your eyes closed,

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
after a while, you can
feel the difference.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
want to get better,

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
you turn off all the lights,
get it completely black

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:84%
where you can't see your
hand, and then it's ideal.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Because what science has
found-- I work with Dr. James

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.926 align:middle line:84%
Hart for a long time
with his-- still do--

00:25:25.926 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:90%
and he's a brain researcher.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And when they need to
get the pineal shut off,

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:84%
they not only have to put
a-- they've tried masks,

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.224 align:middle line:84%
and it works to a degree,
but not completely.

00:25:41.224 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And so they have
to-- they put you

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
in this room that is
absolutely-- not a photon

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.870 align:middle line:84%
bouncing around in that light,
and then the pineal gland

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.040 align:middle line:90%
shuts off completely.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I go into
a very, very dark room.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.139 align:middle line:84%
I get under the bed,
under the sheets, enclosed

00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and everything, so I
got darkness in there,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:90%
and my mask on.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find
that when you get

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.100 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to what this means,
that really makes a difference.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:90%
It makes a huge difference.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Not just in this
work, but in a lot

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:90%
of other work in meditation.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Because, otherwise, you got
your little brain clicking on,

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:90%
going, going, going, going.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Moment you can
eliminate all light,

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.280 align:middle line:90%
the brain goes and stops.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.698 align:middle line:84%
It requires light or it
can't function very well.

00:26:27.698 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Put on your masks.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.456 align:middle line:90%


00:26:35.456 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
talking about a sphere.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be talking
about-- that sphere

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be talking
about is Leonardo's sphere.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Does everybody know
what I'm talking about?

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody know--
does not know

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.430 align:middle line:90%
what the Leonardo sphere is?

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.942 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It's that sphere that's
right out at your fingertips.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.850 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.720 align:middle line:84%
If you remember the
Leonardo drawing

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.895 align:middle line:84%
with the arms going straight
out and the arms legs going out,

00:27:00.895 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a
square, then there's

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:90%
a perfect sphere around you.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.210 align:middle line:90%
That's a sphere.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:09.856 align:middle line:84%
It's a sphere that
completely contains the body.

00:27:09.856 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:84%
That's all you
need to know, just

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.104 align:middle line:84%
the sphere that completely
contains the body.

00:27:13.104 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So you can't stretch
your way out of it.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.220 align:middle line:90%
You're inside of it.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath and
exhale, seeing the white mist,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.508 align:middle line:90%
blow it out between your lips.

00:27:28.508 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:90%


00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Another deep breath, and
blow out the white mist.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And see it, or a sense it,
or feel it as it's going out.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine that you are in a
sphere of light, the Leonardo

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:90%
sphere completely around you.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.957 align:middle line:84%
So sense, or see, or feel that
sphere of light around you.

00:27:56.957 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And feel, or sense, or see the
light inside the sphere that

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.911 align:middle line:84%
you're-- it's a lit
up sphere of light.

00:28:07.911 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Now see and feel yourself
gently lifting off the ground

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and floating just a few
centimeters or a couple

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:90%
inches above the ground.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
weightless and floating.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Now you feel
yourself slowly begin

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
to rise off the seat and
beginning to float up

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.580 align:middle line:84%
into the air,
higher, and higher,

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and higher until your
bubble touches the ceiling.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself very slowly
bouncing off the ceiling.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Now feel yourself float
right through the roof

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and above this room by 50
meters, about 150 feet or so.

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.490 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Up into sky, and you look
around you and see the horizon

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:06.976 align:middle line:90%
all around you.

00:29:06.976 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
You can see it or sense it
or feel it all around you.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Now slowly rotate in
whatever direction

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:84%
you want to go, one
time around 360 degrees,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
while you're
watching the horizon.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go
one time around, stop.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Now see and know that
you, on this level,

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
have eyes in the
back of your head.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel like to see
in both directions at once?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Now see and know that you really
have eyes all over your body.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Every pore of your
body is an eye.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:84%
You can see at all
directions at once.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Feel what it is like
to see spherically.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Now see whatever it is
that is important for you

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.740 align:middle line:90%
to see anywhere in the world.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.890 align:middle line:84%
When this feels
complete, open your eyes.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Immediately write
down your experience

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:90%
without talking or thinking.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Is there anybody here--
if you're writing,

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.486 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and keep breathing.

00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
But if there's
anybody here that's

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:84%
finished who would like to
tell me your experience.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.005 align:middle line:84%
And I'll-- I'm just going
to ask two or three people.

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I flew right
through the ceiling

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
before you told, so very
high, so I had to come back.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Then I couldn't look around.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I just had difficulties
to look behind.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Then when you-- I could see
till there, but not behind.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, I could see
very well the sphere

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and I got-- I still feel
very hot, got very excited.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there were two
images that came to me.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It was a monk walking up
to the mountain in Tibet.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And the other side of the world
I saw Indians doing a ceremony,

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:90%
and I think it was Mexico.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Again, what did it feel like?

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.821 align:middle line:84%
Because you can see
spherically though, right?

00:31:36.821 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:84%
You had trouble
with front and back,

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.970 align:middle line:84%
but you could see
everywhere at once?

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, before, when you told
to turn, I couldn't go behind.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, I see.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
But you could see spherically?

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yeah.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>What did that feel like?

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, I felt very excited.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:90%
I still am, actually.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm all hot.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, OK.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.699 align:middle line:90%
One more person.

00:32:02.699 --> 00:32:03.199 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>I could feel myself going up
and going beyond this building

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:90%
and seeing spherically.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And in order for
me to see behind,

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:84%
I had to let go of my
form and totally turn

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:84%
as if my spirit was free from
the body, being able to turn.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I had a little bit a difficulty
seeing simultaneously,

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.720 align:middle line:84%
but it took a while
of programming

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:84%
myself to giving
me the intention.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Look forward and backward
at the same time.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But then when you said go to
somewhere of a person in need,

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and, all of a sudden,
I was in this town

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and there was a very,
very sick old woman.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And she was sitting in a chair.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a dog, and
everything was the earth,

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.650 align:middle line:90%
and I felt that it was Brazil.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And I came up to her
and she says, oh, I'm

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.140 align:middle line:90%
too sick to go to John of God.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat there and it was
very hard to leave afterwards.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I remember my hand positioning.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And as if I was taking
something off of her,

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
it was an energy, like
as if I was stroking

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.692 align:middle line:90%
that energy off of her.

00:33:10.692 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It was very hard to
come back because she

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.940 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to let me go.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.260 align:middle line:90%
She was holding on to my hand.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a very
powerful experience because she

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:90%
was needing a lot of help.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, this is what I mean.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:84%
We didn't say that, of course,
but that's what she heard.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And in doing that--

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:28.646 align:middle line:90%
>>You didn't say that?

00:33:28.646 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.786 align:middle line:90%
No, it's perfect.

00:33:32.786 --> 00:33:34.910 align:middle line:84%
There was somebody down
there in Brazil needed you,

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.242 align:middle line:90%
and-- and you went down there.

00:33:38.242 --> 00:33:40.366 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, on those levels,
you're an incredible healer.

00:33:40.366 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:90%
You can heal anything.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.070 align:middle line:84%
You're just like John
of God at that point.

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:46.075 align:middle line:84%
You can-- you can do
anything in those levels.

00:33:46.075 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, thank you.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>All right, we're
going to go now

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:90%
to the second one, the next one.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.440 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Put on your masks.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.951 align:middle line:90%
On with your masks.

00:34:05.951 --> 00:34:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:90%
We have a stage coach coming.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
need all that gold.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:27.750 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.144 align:middle line:84%
Deep inhale, seeing the white
mist come out of your lips.

00:34:31.144 --> 00:34:34.399 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:38.256 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, see yourself back
inside this sphere of light.

00:34:38.256 --> 00:34:42.540 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And just lift off a
little tiny bit, just

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.250 align:middle line:90%
so that you're floating.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.499 align:middle line:84%
You can feel yourself
breaking the bonds of gravity.

00:34:52.499 --> 00:34:56.989 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:58.596 align:middle line:84%
Bring your attention
to your knees.

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:02.263 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.263 --> 00:35:04.054 align:middle line:84%
Now bring your attention
to your shoulders.

00:35:04.054 --> 00:35:06.840 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And bring your
attention to your ears.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your
hearing to expand.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.485 align:middle line:84%
And let your hearing
become amazingly enhanced.

00:35:19.485 --> 00:35:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Listen to every tiny
detail in this room.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:33.650 align:middle line:90%


00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Now let your hearing expand out
beyond this room to maybe 50

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
meters all the way
around, 150 feet or so,

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
just out, whatever feels
right, get way out there.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And now listen to everything
inside that sphere of what's

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.830 align:middle line:90%
happening outside this room.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.000 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.666 align:middle line:10%
Now let your sphere of hearing
expand out about 5 miles or so.

00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Now let your hearing
expand all the way

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.237 align:middle line:84%
to the horizon, all
the way around you.

00:36:16.237 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And now you can go anywhere
and listen to anything

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that you want to hear
anywhere in the world.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:39.190 align:middle line:90%


00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:43.292 align:middle line:84%
Now bring your hearing back
to your body in this room.

00:36:43.292 --> 00:36:45.950 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And go inside your ears
and inside your body

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the sounds
deep within your body.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:37:10.670 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Now turn your hearing
to your body itself

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and let it talk to you
and tell you whatever

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.130 align:middle line:90%
it wishes to say to you.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:26.940 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Now bring your attention
back outside of your body

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.870 align:middle line:90%
to the outs-- to this room.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And in your sphere
of light, lift off.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:39.958 align:middle line:90%
Go up to the ceiling.

00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Go through the ceiling
to the outside.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And, now, let yourself fly.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Move freely all over Sedona.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.755 align:middle line:84%
From the air, Sedona
is incredible.

00:37:59.755 --> 00:38:03.920 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And have fun doing it,
swoop around, dive.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.060 align:middle line:84%
You'll also discover
that you can go right

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.047 align:middle line:90%
through solid rock.

00:38:12.047 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:90%


00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:90%
How does this make you feel?

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, while you're flying,
be aware of your body here

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:27.166 align:middle line:84%
in this room, as well
as yourself flying.

00:38:27.166 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:39.320 align:middle line:84%
When you feel both bodies
at once, open your eyes

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.025 align:middle line:84%
and begin to write
down your experience.

00:38:43.025 --> 00:38:56.997 align:middle line:90%


00:38:56.997 --> 00:38:58.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're still
writing, keep writing,

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:06.500 align:middle line:84%
but if you have-- if
you're done and you

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:11.470 align:middle line:84%
would like to talk about what
happened, raise your hand.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>As you were describing, I
would do as you described,

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.860 align:middle line:84%
fall into it, and
then come out of it.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would remember
it for one second,

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and then I completely forget.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
chunk that would

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.817 align:middle line:84%
happen, come out
of it, next second,

00:39:33.817 --> 00:39:34.900 align:middle line:90%
I would completely forget.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, this last
bit, and I only

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:43.780 align:middle line:84%
remember for literally
a fraction of a second.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But I don't remember
anything now.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, as I understand,
that's perfect, that's OK.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Seems weird, I thought
it was weird, too.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
But they said, no,
that that's OK.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.772 align:middle line:84%
We've had lots of
people who just-- they

00:39:57.772 --> 00:39:59.250 align:middle line:84%
remember me saying
close your eyes,

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.916 align:middle line:84%
and all they remember
is open your eyes.

00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't remember
anything in the middle.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But the school says that
when you're in that state,

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:12.370 align:middle line:84%
you're so much into it that
you-- you come out of it,

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:13.770 align:middle line:90%
you can't bring it back.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's-- and that it's OK.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.640 align:middle line:84%
You've done exactly what
you're supposed to do.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.110 align:middle line:90%
You just don't remember.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.146 align:middle line:90%
And so it's OK.

00:40:21.146 --> 00:40:30.330 align:middle line:90%


00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>What's the point
of the exercise?

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>The point of the exercise is
change something within you.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>So it's rewiring.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, even if you don't
remember, it still happened.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm going to have
to trust you on that.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:84%
When I-- what I
found was that there

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.980 align:middle line:90%
is a difference in perspective.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.860 align:middle line:84%
When I'm flying around,
I'm either inside my body

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:90%
or I'm observing my body.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So-- but I can only feel
things when I'm inside my body.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would go back and
forth between imagining it

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:84%
as observing and
being inside actually

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.340 align:middle line:90%
having it happen to me.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it does.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.720 align:middle line:84%
But the only-- the only problem
I have with doing this is I'm

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.160 align:middle line:90%
not an expert like my wife.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And so she could just
tell you everything and--

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you get her
on your cell phone?

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.202 align:middle line:90%
>>Maybe.

00:41:26.202 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>But I found that one was more
comfortable than the other,

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So it was more comfortable
to be outside than in,

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.860 align:middle line:84%
both for the hearing and
for all of these exercises.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>To be outside of your body?

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>To be outside of my body,
that it took more work

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.707 align:middle line:84%
and it was harder
to stay inside.

00:41:44.707 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>So when you were flying,
you had experience of flying?

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.040 align:middle line:90%


00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- it was
like flying dreams.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.998 align:middle line:84%
>>But it's like
you're observing it

00:41:53.998 --> 00:41:57.490 align:middle line:84%
rather than-- observing yourself
flying, rather than actually

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:58.230 align:middle line:90%
flying?

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.757 align:middle line:84%
Right, but when I was
actually inside flying,

00:42:01.757 --> 00:42:03.840 align:middle line:84%
it was like the flying
dreams, where you're diving

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.744 align:middle line:90%
and it's really fun.

00:42:05.744 --> 00:42:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
observing it, there

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.557 align:middle line:84%
was no feel--
there was no sense.

00:42:08.557 --> 00:42:09.390 align:middle line:90%
There is no feeling.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.920 align:middle line:84%
There is no-- no
really experience other

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.430 align:middle line:90%
than just the imagining of it.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I mean, from
the male point of view,

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.940 align:middle line:84%
when you can sense and
you're inside your body

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
flying, that's a better

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.620 align:middle line:90%
way, from my point of view.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what
my wife would say.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:90%
I never know.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't
help you, Annette.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- we're
using this because I

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:84%
found that these
exercises seem to help

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.170 align:middle line:90%
people in a very unusual way.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to stop
it a long time ago.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.920 align:middle line:90%
I tried stopping it once before.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
it's better to do it,

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.200 align:middle line:84%
even though I don't fully
understand everything here

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.200 align:middle line:90%
in this level.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you could ever get to
one of my wife's workshops,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I think she can really
change things fast.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>I didn't realize
that when I started

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.480 align:middle line:84%
flying that I would remember
my dream as a child too,

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot of flying dreams
when I was young.

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.740 align:middle line:90%
And it reminded me of that.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:84%
When you-- as soon
as you mentioned

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.070 align:middle line:84%
about going into the
rock, I was there.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.168 align:middle line:84%
And I had a great
sense of sorrow.

00:43:28.168 --> 00:43:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And I could see Indians,
but I don't know enough

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.650 align:middle line:84%
about identifying what
they were, who they were.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, a
sense of dimensional,

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.390 align:middle line:84%
but felt like I
needed to back away,

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:47.710 align:middle line:84%
so I did, just out of safety,
I guess, or not wanting

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:90%
interfere.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.570 align:middle line:90%
But I just wanted to share that.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>With the native people,
most of their-- definitely

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.840 align:middle line:84%
their religious life is
underground, rather than

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.220 align:middle line:90%
overground.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Far more going on inside the
Earth than there is externally.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:10.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think you were
just remembering

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.116 align:middle line:84%
when you were a kid, what it
was like to go inside those.

00:44:13.116 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Because there's openings
in there and there's

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:18.411 align:middle line:84%
life in those opening
almost always.

00:44:18.411 --> 00:44:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm discovering now that
there's life everywhere

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.876 align:middle line:90%
inside the Earth.

00:44:24.876 --> 00:44:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I've got a whole other
thing going on right

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:32.180 align:middle line:84%
now with-- I can't talk about
it too much because it's

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:35.400 align:middle line:90%
another level of this work.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.549 align:middle line:84%
But inside the Earth is just
one big ball of living life.

00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:40.590 align:middle line:90%
There's so much in there.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just crazy.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.095 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
this, but then I

00:44:44.095 --> 00:44:46.220 align:middle line:84%
talked to some of the
elders-- oh, yeah, of course,

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.002 align:middle line:90%
we know all that stuff.

00:44:48.002 --> 00:44:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, well, why don't
you ever tell me this stuff?

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.270 align:middle line:90%
You weren't ready.

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's interesting.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.830 align:middle line:84%
These two are kind of--
people enjoy these last two.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they
enjoy them so much,

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.800 align:middle line:90%
but they always seem to.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.520 align:middle line:90%
And these two are medicinal.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:16.000 align:middle line:84%
They affect polarities
in your body.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And the results of
these two things

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:22.140 align:middle line:84%
will continue adjusting, making
adjustments in your body,

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:27.190 align:middle line:84%
according to the Hebrews
for about 30 days.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they also
trigger feelings.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I just have
to tell you, I mean,

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.600 align:middle line:84%
you might be driving your car
somewhere two weeks from now

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
start crying.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of
what we're about to do.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.420 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:90%
If it happens, just let it go.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.985 align:middle line:84%
Something's been altered
or changed within you.

00:45:49.985 --> 00:45:55.270 align:middle line:90%


00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:56.047 align:middle line:90%
Put on your masks.

00:45:56.047 --> 00:46:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath again
and blow out the white mist.

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And see or a sense or feel
that mist coming out of you.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.940 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.850 align:middle line:90%
And one more time.

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:18.580 align:middle line:90%


00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.295 align:middle line:90%
Put your attention to your toes.

00:46:21.295 --> 00:46:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
wiggle them.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.665 align:middle line:84%
Bring your attention
to your elbows.

00:46:30.665 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Bring your attention
to your eyes.

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Turn the light of
your eyes inward

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and go down inside your
body, seeing with that light

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:90%
as you go inside your body.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.428 align:middle line:84%
And go down your neck
and into your left lung.

00:46:54.428 --> 00:46:57.550 align:middle line:90%


00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.130 align:middle line:84%
When you go into the lung,
you can feel the space

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.290 align:middle line:90%
that is inside of there.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Look around you and see the
colors, or either the color

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:12.125 align:middle line:84%
or the colors that are
inside your left lung.

00:47:12.125 --> 00:47:19.840 align:middle line:90%


00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Choose one of these colors,
the one that feels right.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.810 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And now feel yourself moving
into this color and this color

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:35.930 align:middle line:84%
expanding all around
you like a fog.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this colored
fog is all around you.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Within this fog is the
female guardian that guards

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:90%
the left side of your body.

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Ask her to come
forth out of this fog

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:03.560 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see her,
or sense her, or feel her.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Now just look into her eyes.

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And she has a message for you.

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this message.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.736 align:middle line:84%
She also has an
object to give to you.

00:48:15.736 --> 00:48:20.090 align:middle line:90%


00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Let her reach forth
and give you the object

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.497 align:middle line:90%
and take it in your left hand.

00:48:24.497 --> 00:48:29.500 align:middle line:90%


00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.300 align:middle line:84%
When you get the object
in your left hand,

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:84%
put your attention
on the object.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And look at it.

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:41.165 align:middle line:84%
Study it very carefully
because it might be something

00:48:41.165 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:90%
you don't quite understand.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:45.260 align:middle line:90%


00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:48.790 align:middle line:84%
If there's writing on it,
or images, or petroglyphs,

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.340 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that, try
to look at all these things.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:55.560 align:middle line:90%
See what they are.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.360 align:middle line:84%
If the object opens, open it
up and see what is inside.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.760 align:middle line:90%
It may open, it may not.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.570 align:middle line:90%
But if it does, look inside.

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.960 align:middle line:90%


00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.940 align:middle line:84%
When you feel like
you've studied the object

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and you understand as much as
you can, you can open your eyes

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.580 align:middle line:90%
and write down your experience.

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:18.360 align:middle line:90%


00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Now we got one more.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're almost
done for the day.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:31.324 align:middle line:84%
Deep breath, blowing
out the white mist.

00:49:31.324 --> 00:49:36.090 align:middle line:90%


00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Seeing and feeling this mist.

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And one more time, do it again.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Bring your attention to your
elbows, to your shoulders,

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.712 align:middle line:90%
and to your eyes.

00:49:48.712 --> 00:49:52.500 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Now turn your light of
your eyes inward again.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Go down inside and use that
light that sees you go in

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:01.796 align:middle line:90%
and go into your right lung.

00:50:01.796 --> 00:50:05.960 align:middle line:90%


00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:11.220 align:middle line:84%
In the right lung, again,
there will be colors in there.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.770 align:middle line:90%
First, see what they are.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And then choose one
of those colors.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And let it grow into a
fog that surrounds you.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:23.190 align:middle line:84%
On the right side of your body,
there's a male guardian there.

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Ask him to come out of the
fog so you could see him.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:32.740 align:middle line:90%


00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.680 align:middle line:90%
He also has a message for you.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Listen to this message
of what he has to say.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:44.510 align:middle line:90%
This message is from his heart.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.916 align:middle line:84%
And he also has an
object to give to you.

00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:50.060 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.890 align:middle line:84%
When he hands you the object,
take it with your right hand.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And, again, study it carefully.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:01.010 align:middle line:90%
If it opens, look inside of it.

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:04.280 align:middle line:90%


00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, look down at the
object in your right.

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Look down at the object
the female gave you

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:19.300 align:middle line:84%
in your left hand and
bow to the male guardian

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.020 align:middle line:90%
and turn from him.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.641 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself moving to your
heart chakra, your lower heart

00:51:24.641 --> 00:51:25.140 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.890 align:middle line:84%
When you get there, look out
of your body in the direction

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:32.982 align:middle line:90%
that you always do.

00:51:32.982 --> 00:51:35.850 align:middle line:90%


00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And feel what your body
feels like, your whole body,

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:44.650 align:middle line:84%
holding these two
objects at the same time.

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:47.320 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.920 align:middle line:84%
These objects represent
polarities within your body

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and we're about to do
something that's going

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.285 align:middle line:90%
to change those polarities.

00:51:54.285 --> 00:51:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Look down at both objects, see
the left, the female object

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.880 align:middle line:84%
in your left hand, the
male object the right hand,

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:90%
and now switch them.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And put the male object
in your female hand

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.706 align:middle line:84%
and your female object
in your male hand.

00:52:10.706 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:90%


00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.380 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.890 align:middle line:84%
What is happening with
your body right now?

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:26.430 align:middle line:84%
If it feels good, even if it
feels OK, even if it feels

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:28.338 align:middle line:90%
neutral, leave them there.

00:52:28.338 --> 00:52:30.970 align:middle line:90%


00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But if it doesn't feel good,
and if it hurts, or doesn't feel

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:38.330 align:middle line:90%
good, then switch them back.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:40.274 align:middle line:84%
But if you can,
leave them there.

00:52:40.274 --> 00:52:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.839 align:middle line:84%
And then when it feels
complete, open your eyes

00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:47.130 align:middle line:90%
and write down your experience.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:56.490 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:58.040 align:middle line:84%
You can keep
writing if you want,

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:02.540 align:middle line:84%
but if there's anybody who
feels they want to talk.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>So out of the
blue fog came a man

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:12.440 align:middle line:84%
who said take this
gift on to the world,

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and then he handed me a dove,
which became many doves,

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.110 align:middle line:90%
and which became into music.

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:22.330 align:middle line:84%
My question would be when I
was switching the objects,

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I kind of had the sense
that there was a dove there.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Because once it
became music, it's

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:30.210 align:middle line:84%
like it became
unto to the world.

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And so, kind of intuitively,
sensed it after switching,

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and after switching, it brought
my heart rate up a little bit.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But, then, it eased down and
I felt comfortable again.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.984 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.984 --> 00:53:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, if you can hold
it there, what's going on

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:52.800 align:middle line:84%
is these are-- you
start out balanced

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.840 align:middle line:84%
at some point with
your polarities.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But, over time, things
happen, and the left--

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:01.070 align:middle line:84%
between the male and female
polarities of your body.

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And those two objects
are representing

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:10.780 align:middle line:84%
the change that needs to bring
balance back into your body.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what this exercise does
is if you can switch them,

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.330 align:middle line:84%
it begins to change and
balance these polarities

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:20.550 align:middle line:90%
on both sides of the body.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.050 align:middle line:84%
But some people,
when they do it,

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I've had people get sick
right on the spot here.

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they cannot do it
or fall over and faint.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean they just really
can't hold the energy.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.762 align:middle line:90%
And if you can't do it, it's OK.

00:54:33.762 --> 00:54:37.110 align:middle line:90%
You have to switch them back.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, so mine wasn't
really a person figure.

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a lion that
came out of the mist.

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>That's OK, too.

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.916 align:middle line:84%
We didn't say it was a
male-- a human person.

00:54:51.916 --> 00:54:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>I could tell he
was a male because he

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.696 align:middle line:84%
had a massive penis at first
dragging on the ground.

00:54:56.696 --> 00:54:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But as he appeared,
it kind of receded.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.515 align:middle line:90%
>>It was a super male.

00:54:59.515 --> 00:55:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Into normal size and what not.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like,
all right, that's odd.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But he told me that I was
the king of my kingdom

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was actually the
king of the universe.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And around his neck was a bell
on a golden, like, ribbon.

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And the bell itself
was covered in symbols

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:20.940 align:middle line:90%
of circles and straight lines.

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:24.055 align:middle line:84%
And then the inside of the
bell was lined perfectly,

00:55:24.055 --> 00:55:26.790 align:middle line:90%
like clear crystal.

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Is that what he gave you?

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, that's what he gave me.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And holding that
in my right hand,

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and then I switched it
over to my left hand, which

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:41.040 align:middle line:84%
from the female side was
a twin clear crystal,

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.950 align:middle line:84%
but with a green
like phantom crystal

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.360 align:middle line:84%
on the inside,
which at that time

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.850 align:middle line:84%
an angel had actually
arisen out of it.

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's weird because--
this is awkward,

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:55.630 align:middle line:84%
but it was almost as
though it was a crystal

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:59.560 align:middle line:84%
vagina that the angel
had risen out of.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I switched them over.

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And, all of a sudden,
I felt my entire self,

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:06.770 align:middle line:84%
kind of swirling together, and
I felt almost a little nauseous

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.490 align:middle line:84%
at first, as far as the
swirling around went.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But, then, the two
items blended into one

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to where it was the
crystal that she

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:20.220 align:middle line:84%
had given me was
actually the wringer

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.610 align:middle line:90%
of the bell on the inside.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And while ringing
the bell, it was

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:29.950 align:middle line:84%
emanating almost an angelic tone
that was very, very soothing

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and made me feel
very, very comfortable

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.480 align:middle line:90%
and pleased with the blending.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And the nausea kind of went away
and I actually felt very whole.

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:42.590 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's what
it was supposed to do,

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.370 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't always do that.

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Cool.

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>But what happens-- I'm
going to end that here--

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:57.470 align:middle line:84%
for the few people who couldn't
handle it and had to switch it,

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:01.110 align:middle line:84%
then you have
special instructions.

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:04.250 align:middle line:84%
If you do-- it's up to you
whether you want to do them

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:11.830 align:middle line:84%
or not, but you would mark on
a calendar 30 days from today,

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:15.810 align:middle line:84%
60 days from today,
and 90 days from today.

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And 30 days from now, you
would go back into meditation,

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:26.050 align:middle line:84%
see the two objects while
you're inside your heart chakra,

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and then switch them again and
see if you can handle that.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot has been
going on in those 30 days.

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:middle line:90%
And if that works, fine.

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you still can't
do it, switch them back.

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Wait another 30 days,
and another 30 days.

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:44.490 align:middle line:84%
If after 90 days, three
times, if you can't do it,

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:48.150 align:middle line:84%
you just cannot keep those
things in that position,

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.980 align:middle line:84%
then just forget it
and leave them there.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But it is a very
powerful, very ancient way

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.350 align:middle line:84%
of balancing the
polarities in your body

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:04.420 align:middle line:84%
by getting the images of
what is needed to do that.

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:07.250 align:middle line:84%
If you did the
same exercise, say,

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.950 align:middle line:84%
two or three months from now,
you may get different objects.

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:11.741 align:middle line:84%
You may get different
stuff, because you've

00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:14.130 align:middle line:90%
changed in that length of time.

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And so, anyway, this
gives you a flavor

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:24.810 align:middle line:84%
of what the ground level is
of this, of the Blue School.

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But they really go much,
much deeper than this.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And unlike me, when my
wife-- when you say something

00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:35.050 align:middle line:84%
about it, she would
know exactly what

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:38.330 align:middle line:84%
to say back to you because
she has so much training.

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:41.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to have--
to do this school,

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:46.490 align:middle line:84%
you have to have 12-- minimum
of 12 years, I believe it is,

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:47.940 align:middle line:90%
of training.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:51.405 align:middle line:84%
So it's much more than a
college degree, or a PhD,

00:58:51.405 --> 00:58:52.530 align:middle line:90%
or anything else like that.

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:54.530 align:middle line:90%
It takes a long time.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And she's had many more-- I
think 30 years or something.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.670 align:middle line:90%
She's been a long time studying.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the only thing
she's ever studied.

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I found that these little
things that we just did really

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:19.150 align:middle line:84%
do help the balance of what we
need in all-- in the next four

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:21.050 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to
talk about tomorrow.

00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And, remember, tonight,
you write the word

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:30.070 align:middle line:84%
reversing on there and do
that thing with the reversing.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And one more thing,
one more thing, you

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.680 align:middle line:90%
write reversing on the table.

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.050 align:middle line:84%
You reverse your day
and do the whole thing,

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:39.270 align:middle line:90%
and then you lay down.

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you go
to sleep tonight,

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:45.190 align:middle line:84%
see yourself, as you're
sleeping, walking

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:49.000 align:middle line:84%
into your dream holding the
two objects in whatever way you

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.620 align:middle line:90%
have them now.

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Just go into the dream
with the two objects

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and whatever happens,
happens after that.

00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Let me go back to tomorrow.

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow's going to be a
completely totally, utterly

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:10.280 align:middle line:90%
different day.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
the human body and healing.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's important for
us to get things more in

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:24.500 align:middle line:84%
balance, not just-- not
just on our polarity aspect,

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.910 align:middle line:90%
but on our physical body.

01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And, like I said, we're going
to focus on these two chakras,

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.369 align:middle line:90%
but other things may come up.

01:00:32.369 --> 01:00:34.493 align:middle line:84%
And if other things come
up, we will deal with them

01:00:34.493 --> 01:00:35.277 align:middle line:90%
as they come up.

01:00:35.277 --> 01:00:37.900 align:middle line:90%


01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:45.020 align:middle line:84%
When you come here tomorrow, I
would wear real simple clothes.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And try to leave your
jewelry home, probably not

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:48.940 align:middle line:90%
your wedding ring.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.990 align:middle line:90%
You can get in trouble.

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But try to leave as much
metal and stuff at home.

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:03.179 align:middle line:84%
And just wear sweat pants,
if you got them, and t-shirt.

01:01:03.179 --> 01:01:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to wear a
t-shirt tomorrow and something

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.990 align:middle line:90%
real simple.

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what.

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to be working.

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
From 9:00 till
12:00, we're going

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
to discuss healing, and what are
the different ideas about this.

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Because those ideas,
people have a lot

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.910 align:middle line:90%
of ideas of what this means.

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
present some of mine

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and also discuss whatever you
have to say about it also.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
have only an hour for lunch,

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:36.870 align:middle line:90%
from 12:00 to 1:00.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to spend
about six hours with healing.

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Every person in
this room is going

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:50.590 align:middle line:84%
to be in the healing
chamber for 25 minutes.

01:01:50.590 --> 01:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And-- and-- this is a very
specific form of healing

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with what
people call sound healing.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's not sound
using instruments,

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.060 align:middle line:90%
it's the human voice.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient
world, the human voice

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.849 align:middle line:90%
could heal anything.

01:02:15.849 --> 01:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And, tomorrow, I'll
actually show you

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
scientifically why the human
voice can heal anything.

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
There is a relationship
between your voice

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and all physiological
aspects of life

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:28.600 align:middle line:90%
at all levels of existence.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.070 align:middle line:90%
And a sound can do a lot.

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Just look what happens
when you sing to your baby

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and it's crying.

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
The change, you can
change things with this,

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
but you can change a lot
more than just little things.

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
You can change big things
inside of yourself.

01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was presented to
me by archangel Michael.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you the story tomorrow
how we found out about this.

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know I've been in
Australia with the Aboriginals,

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and they use didgeridoos
to work on your chakras

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and heals-- that's,
again, using sound

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.380 align:middle line:90%
with breath moving through it.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.170 align:middle line:90%


01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:10.780 align:middle line:90%
But this is really simple.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It is not difficult or hard.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And, at this point,
like even in Germany,

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:19.475 align:middle line:84%
where they found out about this,
they use it in family therapy.

01:03:19.475 --> 01:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they bring
their families

01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:22.130 align:middle line:90%
together to do these things.

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
They can alter the way
families relate to each other.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.900 align:middle line:90%
It's really a beautiful thing.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come to
this workshop and that's

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.085 align:middle line:84%
all they can remember is
what happened tomorrow,

01:03:37.085 --> 01:03:38.560 align:middle line:90%
on the second day.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.550 align:middle line:90%
That's all I need.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time when it was
very hard for me, personally,

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
because I had to
do-- for me, it's

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.820 align:middle line:84%
a very intense
psychic level of work.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And I would get
exhausted sometimes,

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
when-- I've learned how
now not to get exhausted.

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:01.200 align:middle line:90%
But I used to.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So there was a point many
years ago when I said,

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think I'll put
something else in this day.

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was really just because
I was-- it was too hard.

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed that
it didn't work very well

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.040 align:middle line:90%
because people needed that.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was really clear--
I was somewhere in Europe

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:24.270 align:middle line:84%
at one point and I
decided to put it back in

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and the difference
was so amazing.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:30.050 align:middle line:90%
And so I know I can't remove it.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
experience something

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:37.780 align:middle line:90%
that's very beautiful.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen this heal
everything you can think of.

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:44.530 align:middle line:84%
When people get into
the state of sound,

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:47.906 align:middle line:84%
they can just let
go of anything.

01:04:47.906 --> 01:04:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I've seen so much now that it's
just-- I have no expectations.

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:55.046 align:middle line:90%
Just whatever happens, happens.

01:04:55.046 --> 01:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I've had one lady who was--
where I was I-- in Holland,

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and she had shattered her right
knee and she couldn't walk.

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It was just like this.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
That was all, she
couldn't bend it.

01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And she was with a crutch.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And we got into this
and did the whole thing,

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and she just stood
up and jumped,

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and threw her crutch
all across the room

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.100 align:middle line:90%
and broke it against a wall.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.599 align:middle line:84%
Said I don't need
that thing anymore

01:05:19.599 --> 01:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and just started
walking around the room.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.420 align:middle line:84%
That was about 10,
12, 13 years ago.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And I see her at different
places around the world.

01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:29.750 align:middle line:90%
She goes it's still good.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:34.630 align:middle line:90%


01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen every-- I've
seen everything happen.

01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I've seen things that are
just totally impossible

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and considered
miracles, but it's not.

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's the
nature of the reality.

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:50.080 align:middle line:90%
And all things are possible.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
All things, anything
is possible.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how bad it
is, it's still possible.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what we'll
allow to let-- to let go

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and what we will allow to--
allow for us, personally,

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to accept
into our bodies.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.950 align:middle line:90%


01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, tomorrow,
I kind of recommend

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:17.069 align:middle line:84%
that you bring anything
soft you can find anywhere

01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to be on
the floor for a long time.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.500 align:middle line:90%


01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.430 align:middle line:90%
I think that's it.

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:32.068 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, we made
it through the first day.

01:06:32.068 --> 01:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.180 align:middle line:90%


01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Day one is now complete.

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:46.170 align:middle line:84%
You can continue on to day
two of our continuing journey.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:53.967 align:middle line:90%
