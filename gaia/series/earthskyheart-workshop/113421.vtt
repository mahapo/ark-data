00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, so this is
the basics of what

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.140 align:middle line:84%
they look like compared
to somebody that's

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.663 align:middle line:90%
just walking down the street.

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:11.950 align:middle line:90%
This is what they look like.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.970 align:middle line:84%
If you see it from the front,
you can only see three of them.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.320 align:middle line:84%
From the side, you
can see more, which

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:84%
is interesting because--
let me get something here.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:90%
This is a Russian icon.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And you remember when you
see Jesus with those three

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.495 align:middle line:84%
beams coming out the
side of the head?

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:84%
A long time ago,
they could see those.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:90%
We can't very well right now.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.111 align:middle line:84%
And this was one from
my mommy in the 1800s.

00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, you can't see
it unless you get really close.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But the beams are
really good on this one

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:84%
because they're actually,
approximately, the right size

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:90%
and everything to go in there.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'll leave these out
here so you can see them.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'll leave
this one out here.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But the people who are
making these drawings

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:84%
haven't seen them, like
this guy, for example.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%
There, you can see
the three beams.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.448 align:middle line:90%
But they're not that big.

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:90%
You know, he didn't know.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And the disciples
never had those beams.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a drawing
of South Africa.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.872 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's not perfect.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you a
pretty good idea.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you see them
all, this is, kind of,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:90%
what they look like.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.004 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'll leave one of
those out there, too,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
so you can look at
it a little better.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had some of
the kachina dolls.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.844 align:middle line:84%
Here at Hopi Land, the Hopis
combined the kachinas later on.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
A Kachina is an
interdimensional being

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:90%
coming from another world.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at a
lot of the kachina dolls

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
because not all the
Hopis have seen kachinas,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
it's the same kind of thing
where the Christians were

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:90%
trying to draw Jesus' beams.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them, if you
see them, they're accurate.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see these beams
coming out in this whole thing.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:90%
And all ETs have these beams.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.752 align:middle line:84%
There might be a few exceptions,
very rare exceptions.

00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:43.835 align:middle line:84%
But they have to have this
level of consciousness,

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:84%
or they're never going to
get here in the first place.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And the beams are tied,
if you look at animals,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
these are the spots
where the horns come out.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
They're real entry
points into the brain,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
except we never see
this unicorn one.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:90%
We only imagine it.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I'm going to
keep going on this

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:84%
so that you could
get a good idea where

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:90%
we're going with this.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.163 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.163 --> 00:03:21.931 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Pardon?

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.681 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the left and right side.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, there
is a possible one

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:90%
here and coming off the chin.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.026 align:middle line:90%
The chin is a chakra point.

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a very special
chakra point.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And nobody ever talks about it.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Yogi Bhajan talked about it.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:90%
He used it in Kundalini yoga.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:90%
But not very many people do.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:90%
These are antennae.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
They receive images
from the heart.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the link between
the heart and the brain.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have these
things functioning,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.692 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a connection
between the heart

00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
fall, by the way.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:84%
You could see the
fall as falling

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:90%
through dimensional levels.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.235 align:middle line:84%
But a real simple
more accurate way

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
is that we were in our heart,
and we moved to our brain.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And ascension, really, is
just moving back to our heart.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Really, that's all it is.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And the ideas of other
dimensions and parallel worlds

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and all that are
just more mental

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.535 align:middle line:84%
stuff associated with an
external mind function.

00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:90%
We can create anything we want.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We can make this a reality into
any way we want to make it.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
The problem now is that
we don't know that.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And everything is just,
kind of, going unconsciously

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:90%
in wherever's it's going.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not being driven in
a clean cut, clear away.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I've got
to keep going here

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:90%
to explain more about this.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I need
those things to do that.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:84%
There is a order that
these beams have to be.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:84%
When you reconstruct
them, there's an order

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:90%
that they have to go in.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And that order is this
one is number one.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.050 align:middle line:84%
This set and this
set is number two.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And this set is number three.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And this set is number
four, except you

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:90%
don't have to do this one.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It's related to tetrahedral
geometry and the way

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that, very much like the GPS
system in the sky-- by the way,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Bob Dratch invented
the GPS system

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're using in the sky
when he was 11 years old.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And he gave it to
Texas Instrument,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.727 align:middle line:90%
and they stole it from him.

00:06:02.727 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:90%
They stole the whole idea.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:90%
But it's so simple.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just that if you
take a tetrahedron

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and if you have three
satellites aiming

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:84%
at one spot on the earth, you
could measure those differences

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:90%
and get a very accurate place.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:90%
So we use a lot more than three.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:90%
We use a grid of them.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like 20 something of them.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And the more you use,
the more accurate it is.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But in this case here, once you
do 1, 2, and 3, 4 just happens.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do it.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've said that, there
is, every once in awhile,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:90%
it's extremely rare.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:90%
I've only seen it once.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But because I've seen it
once, I know it can happen.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Every once in awhile,
it won't happen.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
It's probably one--
I'm guessing--

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:90%
maybe one in 10,000 people.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But if it doesn't
happen, then all you

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:90%
do is you just manually do it.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:90%
But it usually will happen.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the same when the GPS.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
If you know three points,
you know the fourth.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%
So we only have to do three.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's the order.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:90%
You begin with this one.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Then, you come to
the left right.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Then, you come to
the third eye one.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, this one will
happen automatically.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
They also have a polarity
associated with them.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And this one is positive.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And the opposite is negative.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:90%
This one's positive.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:90%
This one is negative.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.680 align:middle line:90%
And this one is positive.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:90%
And this one is negative.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And the one on the left,
the left side, is positive.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.535 align:middle line:84%
And the one on the
right side is negative.

00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:90%
So this side is positive.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:90%
This side is negative.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
In a minute, you're going to
see it's a really good thing it

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.874 align:middle line:90%
happens to be that way.

00:07:55.874 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would be
really hard to do this.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:90%
And just one more little thing.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Just so you know,
these things light up.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And I mean they
get really bright.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And the light is coming
from the pineal chakra out.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Comes out this way but
there's also a flow in.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:90%
It's coming both ways.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
But the light, as it
comes in, is spiraling.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:33.274 align:middle line:90%
It's rotating.

00:08:33.274 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Same way with your
breathing tube.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.305 align:middle line:84%
Light coming down
is rotating one way.

00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:84%
Coming up, it's
rotating the other way.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And when they meet,
they do that thing.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
things are rotating.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.520 align:middle line:90%
The light itself is doing this.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And when they are fully
activated, there is a sphere.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.705 align:middle line:84%
Now this does not happen and
it will not happen today.

00:09:01.705 --> 00:09:04.441 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it probably
won't happen today.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But when the heart is
completely linked back

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to the brain the way it
was 13,000 years ago,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.200 align:middle line:90%
a sphere appears.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Now this sphere is not going
to fit perfectly in here.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you a
pretty good idea.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:84%
They are literally on the
surface of that sphere.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's a
slight curve that's on there.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:90%
And this sphere is perfect.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't appear
until these other things

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.127 align:middle line:84%
begin to happen that
we're going to talk about.

00:09:44.127 --> 00:09:45.543 align:middle line:84%
Before you get out
of here, you're

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
going to understand
this completely.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.005 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to leave
anything out or hide

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.020 align:middle line:90%
anything or anything.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.270 align:middle line:84%
This takes a while
because it's complicated.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But interesting that,
once you understand this,

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to actually do it
is not that hard.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:90%
It's much easier.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:84%
To do than the Merkaba This
is simple once you get it.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:90%
It just, kind of, happens.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Once you know how to set up one
set of beams, the rest of them

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:84%
are all the same thing
over, and over, and over.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to talk
about the inside, what's

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:90%
going on inside the brain.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:84%
This is what
happens as it leaves

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:90%
the surface of the skull.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It's these pure, white,
clean beams of light.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:90%
But inside, they come like this.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.465 align:middle line:90%
And they curve.

00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
organic in nature.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.387 align:middle line:84%
They're very much
like electricity.

00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:90%
And they're moving all the time.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:90%
They're wiggling.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:84%
You know those
little spheres you

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
can buy with electrical
things and [INAUDIBLE] things

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.954 align:middle line:90%
going zoom, up to the thing?

00:10:51.954 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:90%
They look kind of like that.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly
changing and moving.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.045 align:middle line:90%
And they come like this.

00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.605 align:middle line:90%
They're never the same.

00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is true with the
left and right one, too.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly
moving all the time.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I think I've got
it all on there.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.912 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.912 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:84%
This is what would be
if the heart was fully

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:90%
connected with this.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how it
is for most people.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Not only do they look like
this but the inside-- OK,

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:90%
this is pineal gland.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
The beams as they go--
oh, wait a minute.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I got to put the skull in there.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And beams, as they come in, what
they do is they go like this.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.467 align:middle line:84%
They come down, and
they just go nowhere.

00:12:10.467 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
will come over here.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And it will maybe go up here.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And this one, maybe,
will come down here.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:90%
They avoid like crazy that spot.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:90%
They will not touch it.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
theories of all

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.310 align:middle line:84%
of this in my life
wondering what happened

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:90%
and why this took place.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that in China when they
were studying the psyche case,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:84%
this is the Chinese government
and their scientific community

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
were studying the
super psychic children.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
They studied them
for about 10 years.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, they got freaked out
by them, completely freaked out

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.324 align:middle line:90%
and then switched.

00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:84%
They went into fear and
switched the other way

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.906 align:middle line:84%
and started arresting
them all and doing

00:12:55.906 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of weird stuff.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Arresting the Daoist
and the Qigong masters.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.089 align:middle line:90%
And they're going crazy now.

00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Three of these kids
are more powerful

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
than the entire Chinese
army, and they know it.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.386 align:middle line:84%
And now that they know it,
they're trying to stop it.

00:13:14.386 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:90%
But they can't really.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's what's happening.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
But while they
were studying them,

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:84%
they discovered something,
which was kind of important.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
They found that they
usually came in,

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
they became aware of
their psychic abilities,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
when they were about
five or six years old.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Before that, nothing.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.305 align:middle line:84%
And then, when they
got to puberty, then

00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
they just kept getting
better and better and better

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:90%
and better.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
But when they got to puberty,
one of two things happened.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Either they just kept getting
better and better and better,

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:90%
or it just shut off.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't do it anymore.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And when they studied
them, the Chinese

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
couldn't figure out why
this thing happened.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And it happened.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But what they did find
out is the percentage.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:84%
It happened with
about 80% of the kids.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't do it anymore
when they hit puberty.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And this other 20%
just kept going

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.615 align:middle line:90%
and became super human beings.

00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:19.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I remembered
that percentage

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:90%
and started looking around.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I found out in
the United States

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
we have discovered through
our scientific community

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:84%
that when teenagers go
through puberty, 80% of them

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
grow a calcium shield
around their pineal gland.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And calcium is an insulator.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a soft calcium, kind of
like arthritis type calcium.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And it just blocks the ability
to be able to do this work.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.836 align:middle line:84%
You guys in here,
there's probably nobody.

00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:01.710 align:middle line:84%
You guys probably don't
have a calcium shield

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
or you wouldn't be
here now anyway.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And so now-- well, first
of all, before I say now,

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:20.342 align:middle line:84%
what I think is going on,
just a guess, I don't know.

00:15:20.342 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not even a theory.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a guess.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:84%
we have put a lot of
fear into our children

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:90%
about psychic abilities.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean like,
we burn people a stake.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.480 align:middle line:90%
We've done everything.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the world thinks
it's evil, especially

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
the Christians, which I never
could understand because here's

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Jesus doing all these things.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
He's bringing people back
from the dead and all kinds

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.330 align:middle line:90%
of stuff.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, Jesus says
to the Christians,

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
all these things I'm doing,
you can even do greater things.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
He's giving them
permission saying OK.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time,
if somebody floats off

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:84%
the ground or something like
that, then it's from the devil.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't get that.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, the fear
has been put out there.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that
the children are saying,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, mommy and daddy,
I will be a good kid.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And I will not do
psychic ability.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:90%
Seal it up.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that may be an
answer, or maybe

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.870 align:middle line:90%
it's only part of an answer.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that the
percentages are the same here

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
as they are in China.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that
[? for naught. ?]

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But almost everybody
walking around now

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:84%
has these things
non-functioning.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And these things are not
touching the pineal gland

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.650 align:middle line:84%
or pineal chakra
rather, in this case.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:84%
The gland is the one
that gets sealed.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.625 align:middle line:84%
But it's the chakra
that works off of it.

00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And these things are
connecting to the chakra

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and not to the gland,
just to be clear.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And so your job now is to get
these back into straight beams

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:90%
and reconnect this.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
And if you can do that, you
will reestablish the potential

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:90%
of reconnecting to your heart.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do this
today and get you to do it.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, tomorrow and
the next day, we're

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.890 align:middle line:84%
going to go back
through these procedures

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect your heart
back to the brain.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And once that
happens, you're going

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:90%
to become incredibly psychic.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you use it in
the way I suggest,

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:84%
that power will be used only for
good and not for good and bad.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:90%
It'll be not polarized.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
The intention will only go
to help life everywhere.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.782 align:middle line:84%
So that's our job now is
to reconnect these sayings,

00:17:52.782 --> 00:17:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and get these beams straight.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>When we reconnect it,
it connects to the land

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:90%
or still to the chakra?

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.135 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:90%
You mean these beams?

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>They connect to the
chakra, not to the gland.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Even after the
activity that we will do?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:84%
The gland is only
the source of power.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like this is
your heart chakra.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Here's your heart over here.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a direct
connection between the two.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.960 align:middle line:90%
But they're very different.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:90%
And they're both important.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.895 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
source of this chakra.

00:18:32.895 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
things you would

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:84%
do with the chakra and some
things you would do a heart.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that when we get to it.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But in this case here,
definitely, you're

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the
chakra, not the gland.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very close
together but not very

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:50.855 align:middle line:90%
far apart.

00:18:50.855 --> 00:18:52.274 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:18:52.274 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
give you instructions

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:90%
on how to redo this.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
How to go from the fuzzy
little beams to this.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, tomorrow we're
going to come back to this

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and add a whole bunch more
stuff on here that will,

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
at that point,
it'll become clear.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll understand
why we're doing that.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
But right now, we're just
getting these beams out.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving backwards,
which is not really logical.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.262 align:middle line:84%
We're going from a Merkaba
field, which that's out here.

00:19:24.262 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Merkaba
field is intimately

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.340 align:middle line:84%
connected to these beams
and to this sphere.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:84%
This sphere here is intimately
connected at this point

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:37.090 align:middle line:84%
right here to the Leonardo
sphere that's in your Merkaba.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
There is a very direct
relationship between those two

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
but will slowly work so
that it becomes clear where

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:90%
we're going with all of this.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you do.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.529 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give you the
instructions exactly the way

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans and the
[? Cohunes ?] told

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
me, which is how to do
it on another person

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
because the way they
teach you is how they're

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:84%
going to do it to their children
when they reach puberty.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to give
you the same instructions.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But you are going to have
to apply that to yourself.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I had two
people come together.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And one would do each other one.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is that, if
you don't do this right,

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
you give that other person
an unbelievable headache.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a migraine headache
of major proportions.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did it a few times after
you have about half the room

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:90%
mad at the other half the room.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:90%
I figured no more of that.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
If you may give
yourself a headache,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to do it yourself
so you don't blame anybody.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to show you how
to do it on someone else.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you're
going to apply it to yourself.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see it's
not that hard to do.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you do.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
You start with number one,
this one, the unicorn one.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know
where that location is,

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:84%
take the tip of your nose
and the tip of your chin.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Move it up and rock over.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:84%
That point right there where
I'm in right now is this one.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the third eye.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.746 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to need
to know where that point is

00:21:15.746 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:90%
next or very soon.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.460 align:middle line:84%
If you move that thing
up to here and rock down,

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that will show you
where the uniform one

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.469 align:middle line:90%
is, which is way up here.

00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you do it
one more time, it'll

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:90%
show you where that one is.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So these three will show you
that all three of those points

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.665 align:middle line:90%
are tied to the pineal chakra.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come in with
other glands and things

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:90%
here later.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.739 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
other stuff in here

00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:47.090 align:middle line:84%
that all has to be
operating at the same time.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a much more
complex pattern.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I just want to get these
beams out right now.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let you know
where this place is

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:84%
where you do that, I want to
show you where this place is.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is you have a little
bump on the back of your head

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:90%
back here.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, directly below it,
there's a little soft spot.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:90%
There's probably a name for it.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.972 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:22:14.972 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%
What's it called?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.981 align:middle line:90%
>>Occiput.

00:22:16.981 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Obsee?

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Occiput.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Obseeto?

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.875 align:middle line:90%
>>Occiput.

00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Occiput.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>You all sound like you're
saying different words to me.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Occiput.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Occiput?

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.349 align:middle line:90%
That's what she was saying, yes.

00:22:34.349 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't think
that-- is that right?

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.389 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what [INAUDIBLE] says.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.275 align:middle line:90%
>>Is that right?

00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he says yes.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:90%
This guy knows, I'm sure.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, occiput.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:90%
So that's a chakra point.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a major chakra point.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean I have to
lift up my pony tail?

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>It's right here.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Don't look.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.365 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:03.365 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, anyway.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So now you know where
these come out of.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.487 align:middle line:90%
And so, here's the procedure.

00:23:19.487 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:90%
This is what you do.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.727 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.727 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is on somebody else.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.410 align:middle line:90%
But you do the same thing.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, you got a fuzzy
thing here, right.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
You just reach up
with both hands.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.359 align:middle line:84%
You have to come around to
the left side of the body.

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have
it facing this way.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
You can't go around to
the right side of the body

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.149 align:middle line:84%
if you're doing it
on somebody else.

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It won't work, and I'll
explain why in just a moment.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.916 align:middle line:84%
You have to come around
to the right side,

00:23:44.916 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, the left
side of the body.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:90%
The left side of the body.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
this beam coming out of here

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:90%
has a positive charge.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And this one has
a negative charge.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:90%
And you got to use your hands.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And your left hand
has a negative charge.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And your right hand
has a positive charge.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when you couple
over the top of these,

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.879 align:middle line:84%
the negative hand couples
with the positive.

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And the positive couples
with the negative.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It will not work if you try
it the other way around.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.227 align:middle line:90%
And so you come around here.

00:24:18.227 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing you do is you
have this fuzzy little thing.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.434 align:middle line:84%
And you have a little
fuzzy thing here.

00:24:22.434 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this
one in the front

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:28.100 align:middle line:84%
is almost always bigger
than this one back here.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
This one is always
the weakest one.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Not always.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:90%
There's always exceptions.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But usually, this one here
is just a little tiny nub.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And this one's bigger.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So you get these clouds
that are out there.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have to see
them, unfortunately.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.705 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
see them on yourself.

00:24:53.705 --> 00:24:55.329 align:middle line:84%
But if you're working
on somebody else,

00:24:55.329 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:90%
you have to see them.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And for one thing, for
thousands of years,

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:90%
they've kind of moved around.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And they may not be coming
directly out of those points.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:90%
They maybe up high.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And this one might be low.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:90%
This one might be off center.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And maybe concussions or things
that have happened over time.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:90%
But you just grab those things.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And you grab this
one and this one.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And with your
intention, you tell

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
the body, this other person or
yourself, to go into a beam.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is, even though
you see this big, fuzzy thing,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and you grab it, and you
tell it to go into a beam,

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
it will [SNAP] just
like that, instantly.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But the beam will usually
only be about this long.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.534 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this one
will be an inch.

00:25:42.534 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is a half
an inch or something.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:90%
It'll be really short.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:84%
When it condenses down into the
beam, there's not much there.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.055 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell by
how long they are

00:25:53.055 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and how much power the
pineal chakra is putting out.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And so you're holding
them just like handlebars,

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.298 align:middle line:84%
like you're holding on the
handlebars of a motorcycle

00:26:02.298 --> 00:26:02.840 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.881 align:middle line:90%
You're holding them here.

00:26:03.881 --> 00:26:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And you tell them
to go into a beam.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And they will be
short little things

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
where you can sense or
feel which one is stronger

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and which one is weaker.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:90%
You go to the weaker of the two.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And you tell just
that one to put out

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.650 align:middle line:90%
more energy you get longer.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.242 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking to another
body, you can use words.

00:26:26.242 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:90%
The body will hear you.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
But you can talk
inside of your head.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
The body will hear you just
as well, maybe even better.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you could just tell
it to put out more energy.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:90%
And it will do what you say.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But it'll usually go like
this a little tiny bit more

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because the body hasn't
done this in a long time.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And to it, it's putting
out a lot more energy.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
But you have to say, no, more.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And the body sometimes, kind
of, freaks out over this.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:84%
The person itself is, usually,
going through something

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to
pull it all the way out.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
You're going to just make
it as wide as your palm.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
You just want it to
do a lot more energy

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:90%
than what it's been doing.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And so you just
keep telling it, no,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:84%
more, more more,
and more until that

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:84%
beam starts to extend
out from the palm.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:90%
And then, you can just stop.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And when it does,
then you switch

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:90%
to the more powerful one.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And you tell it to do it.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.738 align:middle line:84%
And usually, you might have to
tell it 10 times to keep going.

00:27:33.738 --> 00:27:34.238 align:middle line:90%
More.

00:27:34.238 --> 00:27:34.656 align:middle line:90%
No, more.

00:27:34.656 --> 00:27:35.074 align:middle line:90%
No, more.

00:27:35.074 --> 00:27:35.492 align:middle line:90%
No, more.

00:27:35.492 --> 00:27:35.992 align:middle line:90%
No, more.

00:27:35.992 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And the little bodies going,
you got to be kidding.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.660 align:middle line:90%
This is a lot of energy.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.815 align:middle line:84%
And you get it out to
approximately this long

00:27:43.815 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:90%
in both hands.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, that's
all you gotta do.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.556 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
perfect, or super precise,

00:27:50.556 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:90%
or anything else like that.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You just get approximately
about the width of your hands.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.340 align:middle line:90%
And then, you drop your hands.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And you put your chakra points
directly over those points

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
right over the top
of those points.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you're doing
it on your own hand,

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
your left hand
goes in the front.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And your right hand
goes on the back.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Now you can do this
without your hands

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing
it to yourself.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:84%
You can just do it
sitting and do all of it

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:84%
without a-- you're communicating
with your own body.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:90%
It's very clear.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But some people
really need to feel,

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and they need to
use their hands.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So you put your hands over
the top of your chakra,

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:90%
over that chakra, et cetera.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Bam.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But then, the next
thing you do, and this

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is hard to explain--
hopefully, you

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:84%
can pick this up--
you close your eyes.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.195 align:middle line:84%
You can see inside the
body with your eyes closed.

00:28:49.195 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:84%
If you open them up, you see
the surface or what's around it.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But you can't see
inside the body.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you close your eyes
and with your intention,

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:84%
you look to see
the pineal chakra.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
If you do, it's usually,
for most people,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.030 align:middle line:90%
it shows up as red.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And some people, it
shows up as black.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.310 align:middle line:90%
For you, it might be turquoise.

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
But majority of people,
it's usually red or black.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And you see this.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Once you see that,
the next thing

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is forget about all
these other beams.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:84%
You're only looking
at this one now.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.270 align:middle line:84%
You look to see these
two little beams that

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:90%
are wiggling around there.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:90%
And so you the chakra point.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And you see these little
beams going like this.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And now with you're
holding your hands

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
over that with
your intention, you

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:84%
get those beams to
connect to that.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to do it.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.694 align:middle line:90%
They will fight you.

00:29:48.694 --> 00:29:51.110 align:middle line:84%
You'll get them, and they're
just like going, (BABY VOICE)

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.760 align:middle line:90%
no, I won't do that.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And you have to, (DEEP
VOICE) yes, you will.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And you got to keep
working with them.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
they'll connect.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And it'll do it for, like,
two seconds and go ha ha ha.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And they'll break apart
and start going away.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
They're doing a no no.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you just keep doing it
until you get them to connect.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, you got
to hold it there

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:22.190 align:middle line:84%
for-- it depends on the person
but-- at least a minute,

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even two minutes,
until you can see that they're

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.530 align:middle line:90%
not going to break apart.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you
feel that they're not

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
going to break apart and
you've got them there, then

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:84%
with your intention, you pull
the beams out from the palms.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:90%
You pull them out.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And then will follow
right behind your hands

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:84%
as you go and go
beyond the sphere

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
because once they get to where
this sphere is, they will stop.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And so you go out this far out.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Say, you can go past
it a few inches.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Won't matter.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't matter if
you went that far out.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Just have to get
it out farther than

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:84%
one hand length
above away from this.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.734 align:middle line:84%
And then, the one hand
length is this one for sure.

00:31:11.734 --> 00:31:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, it depends on
the shape of the head.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.600 align:middle line:84%
If they have to
conform to the sphere,

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:90%
then it's formed through that.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:90%
So you pull them out.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:90%
They'll come out.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:90%
There's no sphere here now.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:84%
There's just these to
beams sitting there.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you get them
out, the next thing you do

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
is you shift your attention to
the very ends of these things.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And they're pulsing.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:90%
They're throbbing.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done
the geometry work.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'm about 99.999999%
certain that it's

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.900 align:middle line:84%
connected to the heartbeat
because these beams are

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.130 align:middle line:90%
directly connected to the heart.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned some
things about this.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.190 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
tell when someone's

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.840 align:middle line:90%
going to have a heart attack.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.392 align:middle line:84%
You can tell, probably,
at least a week in advance

00:32:03.392 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:84%
for sure if they're going
to have a heart attack when

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.600 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
because this beam here

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:90%
will rotate into this beam.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And there won't be
one here at all.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It'll look like one beam
here, and there's really two.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to separate
them and pull them back,

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:84%
the moment you let go,
like, they're spring loaded.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:90%
They'll go right back again.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's a long story how
I found out about this.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.950 align:middle line:90%
But it happens every time.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.150 align:middle line:84%
If you could get these beams up
under a computer screen, which

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
you can do because they're
electromagnetic in nature,

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.135 align:middle line:84%
you would be able to
just take a photograph

00:32:42.135 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and know if someone's about
to have a heart attack.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So once you've pulled
them out and you

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:55.110 align:middle line:84%
got to feel this pulsing and,
for me, I feel it in the palms.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.641 align:middle line:84%
Well what it is is they're
pulsing like a ping pong match.

00:32:59.641 --> 00:33:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Pulse.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.021 align:middle line:90%
Pulse.

00:33:01.021 --> 00:33:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Pulse.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Pulse.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Pulse.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:02.939 align:middle line:90%
Pulse.

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Pulse.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Back and forth.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:06.870 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Is there anybody here that
knows [? Jensen ?] Jitsu?

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:90%
A little bit?

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.356 align:middle line:84%
>>No, but I know that trick
of feeling simultaneous.

00:33:20.356 --> 00:33:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:84%
They have patterns for
every disease or problem

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.040 align:middle line:90%
that you can think of.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.099 align:middle line:84%
And you'll pick a point here
and maybe a point over here.

00:33:30.099 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're throbbing
back and forth.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Dom, dom, dom, dom.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And you have to, with intention,
get them to stop doing that

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.742 align:middle line:90%
and go pulsing the same.

00:33:38.742 --> 00:33:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they
pulse the same,

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:84%
then you go to another
set of patterns

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.043 align:middle line:90%
and get those to pulse the same.

00:33:43.043 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And you keep going.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, whatever the person's
problem is just disappears.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very good.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:90%
But this is very similar.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.889 align:middle line:84%
With your intention, you've got
to get them to pulse the same.

00:33:54.889 --> 00:33:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is you're
putting your intention in there

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:58.846 align:middle line:84%
to pulse the same,
pulse the same.

00:33:58.846 --> 00:34:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And you might go for 30 seconds.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, it goes through
a moment of chaos.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And the pulsing, which was going
pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse,

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:90%
pulse, pulse.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.639 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes pulse,
p-p-p-pulse and it kind of goes

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:90%
crazy for a moment.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Then, pulse, pulse.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.374 align:middle line:90%
They're pulsing the same.

00:34:16.374 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they are,
you count the pulses.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.980 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans say you wait
until you get 20 pulses.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.681 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's because
of their 2013 systems and all

00:34:32.681 --> 00:34:33.389 align:middle line:90%
that other stuff.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.639 align:middle line:84%
But they say 20
pulses will stabilize.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:90%
I go on.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:41.440 align:middle line:90%
I go to like 25 to make sure.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.219 align:middle line:84%
But you have to do,
at least, 20 pulses.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel 20
pulses or more on there,

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.550 align:middle line:90%
you can drop your hands.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
And this beam will
be connected in here.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.969 align:middle line:90%
And it'll just stay there.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:35:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, you go around to
the back of the person next

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to get to the side beams
because that's number two.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And you get to these
beams on the side.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Now where it is, again,
it's not the temples.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:15.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you go right to where
your ear comes to your head,

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.030 align:middle line:84%
it's just a little higher and,
maybe, just a little tiny bit

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:90%
in front.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.710 align:middle line:90%
It's right about there.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.250 align:middle line:90%
You can, kind of, feel it.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It goes all the way through
into the pineal chakra.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's where they come out.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And so you go behind the person.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And you repeat
what you just said.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:90%
You see the little fuzzy things.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.890 align:middle line:84%
If they're off center,
you just pull them back

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:42.310 align:middle line:84%
with your intention to
get them where they are.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Feel which is weaker.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Get that weaker one.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Talk to the body.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Get it to come out there.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Do the other one out to there.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Put your hands on the
palms on a person's head

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.900 align:middle line:84%
or on your own head
if you're doing it.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:90%
And look inside.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
inside your own head

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.240 align:middle line:90%
looking with your eyes closed.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.784 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see
the pineal chakra.

00:36:09.784 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:90%
You'll see the little beams.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.780 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
them to connect.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Once they're connected,
then you pull the beams out

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.760 align:middle line:90%
on either side.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It's convenient
because your left hand

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.172 align:middle line:84%
happens to be where
the positive beam is.

00:36:23.172 --> 00:36:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you'd have to be
doing this kind of stuff,

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:25.963 align:middle line:90%
which is hard.

00:36:25.963 --> 00:36:31.290 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:90%
And then, you pull them out.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And you do the
pulsing thing again.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:90%
They'll be going back and forth.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
You gotta stop that
with your intention.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Get it to pulse the same.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Count 20 or more.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:90%
And then, you can drop that one.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Then, you come to your
third eye, this level

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.990 align:middle line:90%
one running across here.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And you do exactly
the same thing.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.436 align:middle line:84%
And then, this one will
happen automatically.

00:36:57.436 --> 00:36:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, you should
not have to do this one.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:84%
If you have to do this one, it's
a little awkward in the sense

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:90%
that you have to do it here.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But you can only reach this
from at the peritoneum.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no other way.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a long ways in.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.837 align:middle line:84%
But to reach up through
the tube is the only way

00:37:14.837 --> 00:37:16.420 align:middle line:84%
you can get to this
point because it's

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of your throat.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's not likely
that you'll even

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:84%
see anybody in your lifetime
that has to do that.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But just so you know, you can't
reach this point from here.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to reach it all
the way from the breathing

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.520 align:middle line:90%
tube at the perineum.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.560 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.656 align:middle line:84%
So you get to know that
person really well.

00:37:40.656 --> 00:37:43.136 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:43.136 --> 00:37:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:37:53.890 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Once these are out and running,
what happens in actual practice

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
when you do it to someone
else is, a lot of times,

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:11.310 align:middle line:84%
they'll run for about 10
or 15 minutes and collapse.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have to
do it all over again.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the second
time will hold.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And at which point, it
will go for quite awhile.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know how long.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:90%
A long time.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:84%
But really, this system
to get these out,

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:84%
you only have to do it about
two weeks, every day for about

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:36.460 align:middle line:90%
two weeks, and it's permanent.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:90%
It won't go away after that.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't do
a lot of function.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's out
there and running,

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:84%
it's very much like
the Merkaba field.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba field
doesn't do much

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:53.430 align:middle line:84%
until everything is
lined up at once,

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.260 align:middle line:90%
and we're going backwards.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.150 align:middle line:90%
So you got your Merkaba field.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to have
your beams of light set up.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.670 align:middle line:84%
There will be no
sphere around i yet.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And this sphere,
by the way, glows.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It produces a halo around the
body that you can photograph.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:90%
And science has done this.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Dr. James Heart has
discovered that once anybody

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.360 align:middle line:84%
goes into this
thing and does this,

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.000 align:middle line:84%
their heads actually
glows in the dark.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.510 align:middle line:90%
And they can see them.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:90%
They can photograph it.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.260 align:middle line:84%
That's why with Jesus, they
put that thing around him.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Or with Buddha, too.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Buddha had the same
thing going on.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.520 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't see
the beams with him.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But he had his
beams going for sure

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:36.440 align:middle line:84%
or he wouldn't have
been where he was.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.020 align:middle line:90%
It's coming.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.210 align:middle line:90%


00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>You didn't say what is the
weak one in the other two.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:84%
You said we need to
start with the weak one.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.789 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, you on.

00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:52.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the same procedure
that we did in this one

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.830 align:middle line:84%
you do on the left,
right, or the front, back,

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:56.110 align:middle line:90%
or any of them.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.327 align:middle line:84%
The procedure is identical
on each one of them.

00:39:59.327 --> 00:40:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So you always start with the
weaker one to bring it out.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Then, you go over to the
stronger one to bring it out.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>So there's no weaker one?

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.180 align:middle line:90%
I need to feel it?

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Or is it always one side?

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Well I can feel it.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.090 align:middle line:84%
If you can't feel
it, then guess.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not essential.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.769 align:middle line:84%
You can start with
the stronger one.

00:40:19.769 --> 00:40:21.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you pull the
stronger one out first,

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.680 align:middle line:84%
it's harder to pull
out the weaker one.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.140 align:middle line:84%
It's better to pull out the
weaker one first, and then

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.470 align:middle line:90%
the stronger one.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And it will only work if
you do it in this sequence?

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.300 align:middle line:90%
First, this one [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>In this order?

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Both the Kahunas
and the Mayans

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.430 align:middle line:90%
are really adamant about that.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is the order and
not to go in any other order.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.905 align:middle line:84%
I've never even tried any
of the-- I just trust them.

00:40:45.905 --> 00:40:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I've never even
tried it in any other order.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to develop
a new science or anything.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:90%
You know, if you say, so, OK.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they told me is
you got to do it in this order.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm strong about that because
when the Kahunas knew exactly

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
the same thing and did exactly
the same order, I said,

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:05.794 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, OK.

00:41:05.794 --> 00:41:06.585 align:middle line:90%
I believe you guys.

00:41:06.585 --> 00:41:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it right to say
the pulse that you

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:19.120 align:middle line:84%
feel on your hands should be
equal to a person's heart rate?

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe you will find
that it is directly connected

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to the pulsing of the heart.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>So that means
that we can actually

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.750 align:middle line:84%
check the exact pulse
and the rate of that?

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, you should be able to.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.820 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to experiment,
you should be able to do that.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Meaning that we done
it correctly then.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.039 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

00:41:41.039 --> 00:41:41.700 align:middle line:90%
You don't what?

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Does that mean that we've done
it correctly, the rate we feel

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and the exact rate
of the person?

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>Well.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>If they are equal.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, they're
pulsing at the same time.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:59.520 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that's going
to help you to get these two

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:84%
things to pulse the
same because you're

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:84%
going to feel in one
hand a pulse, and then

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.570 align:middle line:90%
in the other hand a pulse.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to get them so
they're pulsing simultaneously.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, and it doesn't matter
if you've linked it to the heart

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:90%
or not, at this point.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But I'm almost certain for
sure that that's what it is.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I've learned too much
about the relationship

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.310 align:middle line:90%
between this and the heart.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
intimately connected.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.510 align:middle line:90%
I was in Mexico one time.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I used to actually find
people in the audience that had

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:90%
really bad migraine headaches.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And I would work on them
because, when you do this,

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:90%
the migraine goes away.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:84%
If you have migraines
all the time,

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.230 align:middle line:84%
you're in luck
because if you do this

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and you establish these
things, more than likely,

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.840 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find that your
migraines stop, unless it's

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.970 align:middle line:84%
caused by a physiological
thing, something like a tumor

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:04.070 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.380 align:middle line:84%
But if it has any emotional
base in it at all,

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.920 align:middle line:90%
this is going to go away.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.860 align:middle line:84%
They just stop, as long
as you keep the beams out.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's how
I found out because I

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.430 align:middle line:84%
was doing psychic
work for the Mayans

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:25.780 align:middle line:84%
at-- where was I--
[? Palankay ?].

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I got done
after a day's work

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.160 align:middle line:84%
of doing this psychic work,
my little psychic muscle

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.295 align:middle line:90%
was hurting.

00:43:32.295 --> 00:43:33.170 align:middle line:90%
And I had a headache.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And I never get
headaches, never.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.376 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 15 years, or 20 years or
something, I get a little one.

00:43:38.376 --> 00:43:40.040 align:middle line:90%
But I don't get headaches.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just had this
banging headache.

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they stopped it.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They made me do this and
headache went away instantly.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And so I was using people.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And I would get somebody that
had a really bad headache.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And they'd come up here.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'd pull all their beams
out and stuff like that.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And every single time,
that person would go,

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.215 align:middle line:90%
wow, I feel good.

00:44:00.215 --> 00:44:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a problem
anymore, you know.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I would use them as
biofeedback to the group.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.830 align:middle line:90%


00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But one time, I was in Mexico
and I asked for somebody.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.865 align:middle line:84%
And this guy jumped up, ran,
and slid on the floor right

00:44:16.865 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.156 align:middle line:84%
He say's, you got to
do me, I can't see.

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>And i just said, OK, OK, OK.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I put him in a
chair and did this thing.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I, when
I started with him,

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.610 align:middle line:90%
he was missing this one.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:90%
And I intuited it was in here.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And I found it.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And I got it and moved
it back up to here.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, the moment I would
let go of it, it would go back.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't get it to
go up to that position.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Every time I'd let go,
it would go right back.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And five, six, seven
times it would do that.

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I had to
tell him, I'm sorry,

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.215 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
what's going on.

00:45:00.215 --> 00:45:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
to deal with this.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.791 align:middle line:90%
So I told him, I can't help you.

00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:06.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:07.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's going on.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:11.090 align:middle line:84%
When he left and when
there was a break,

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I went into the angels,
and I said, what was that?

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:14.619 align:middle line:90%
What was happening?

00:45:14.619 --> 00:45:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
said, well, he's

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.118 align:middle line:84%
going to have a heart
attack in about two days.

00:45:18.118 --> 00:45:21.240 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.805 align:middle line:90%
And that is one of the signs.

00:45:22.805 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, they told
me I had to tell him,

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:90%
which I don't like that.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So I went to him and
I said, you know--

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and he was only 35 years old--
and I said to him, I'm sorry,

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.060 align:middle line:84%
but they're telling
me that you're

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.160 align:middle line:84%
going to have a heart
attack very soon.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And he went, me?

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:51.759 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
problem with that.

00:45:51.759 --> 00:45:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's
what they told me.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
if it does happen,

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:57.852 align:middle line:84%
you need to work
with these beams

00:45:57.852 --> 00:45:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and reconnect all this stuff.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I told him what to do.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, he had a heart
attack, went to the hospital,

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and he did exactly
what I told him to do.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.360 align:middle line:84%
That was 15 years ago, probably,
or something like that.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:90%
And he's fine now.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But that was my first
indication that there

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.480 align:middle line:84%
was a direct relationship
between these beams

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and the heart.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Now I know for sure
there is on other levels.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I
hope that helps.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So does everybody
understand how to do this?

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:37.704 align:middle line:90%
I'll put up questions.

00:46:37.704 --> 00:46:39.245 align:middle line:84%
But we have to follow
the microphone.

00:46:39.245 --> 00:46:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, I have one question.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.580 align:middle line:84%
It is OK to do this
to the children?

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it's OK.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.271 align:middle line:90%
It's good for them.

00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:46.656 align:middle line:90%
They like it.

00:46:46.656 --> 00:46:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh because one of
your books you said

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:51.390 align:middle line:90%
also mentioning [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And he does, pretty much,
the same on the video that he

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.560 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.486 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, [? Bronokov in ?]
Russia, Moscow?

00:46:58.486 --> 00:47:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't know
what he does, actually.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:03.410 align:middle line:90%


00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>You mentioned it
in one of your books

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.750 align:middle line:84%
that there are psychic
children in Russia.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I know what
he's doing in his work.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.857 align:middle line:84%
He takes blind children
and teaches them to see.

00:47:13.857 --> 00:47:15.765 align:middle line:84%
He takes people who
are totally blind

00:47:15.765 --> 00:47:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and teaches them how to read,
watch television, and drive

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:18.640 align:middle line:90%
cars.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to believe,
but it's true.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.555 align:middle line:84%
>>And I've been involved with
people that are totally blind.

00:47:28.555 --> 00:47:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned Mary Ann
Schinfield a long time ago.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Mary Ann Schinfield
was completely blind.

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:36.760 align:middle line:90%
She was in her '50s.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But you would never know she was
blind by interacting with her

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.390 align:middle line:84%
because she seems
totally normal.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But she actually
has no eyes at all.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.510 align:middle line:90%
And she can see.

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.300 align:middle line:90%
NASA has taken her now.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll probably never
see her again.

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:53.120 align:middle line:90%
They didn't believe her.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.210 align:middle line:90%
They asked her, where are you?

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
I'm actually floating

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.050 align:middle line:84%
around the solar system
most of the time.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know, I'm sure,
they internally, kind of,

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:03.990 align:middle line:90%
laughed at her.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, well, if
you're really floating around,

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.160 align:middle line:84%
then we want you to go to a
certain satellite up there

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.701 align:middle line:84%
and read the serial
number off of it.

00:48:10.701 --> 00:48:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:16.070 align:middle line:90%
And that caught their attention.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:19.072 align:middle line:84%
And so they use her as
eyes to go out and see

00:48:19.072 --> 00:48:21.030 align:middle line:84%
because she can go to
Mars or anywhere and just

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.738 align:middle line:84%
go right down to
something to look at it,

00:48:22.738 --> 00:48:24.450 align:middle line:90%
and tell them what they see.

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And she's very good.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:90%
And I've been with her.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I spent three or
four months with her

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and got to do what
she got to do.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.578 align:middle line:90%
And it was fun.

00:48:36.578 --> 00:48:39.390 align:middle line:90%
And I learned a lot from her.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:43.910 align:middle line:84%
But more recently,
I was with a Navajo

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and with one of
the shamans there.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And I took a group into Antelope
Canyon, which on Navajo land.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:54.745 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
their permission.

00:48:54.745 --> 00:48:56.630 align:middle line:90%
And so he took us there.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And he is also a shaman.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And we were there with his
two aunts, I think they were.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.820 align:middle line:84%
These two women that were
a little older than him.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.757 align:middle line:84%
And so he led us
through the canyon.

00:49:10.757 --> 00:49:11.840 align:middle line:90%
He gets to the other side.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.548 align:middle line:84%
He tells us all these
stories and things.

00:49:13.548 --> 00:49:16.642 align:middle line:84%
He comes in, and he
sings peyote songs to us.

00:49:16.642 --> 00:49:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And he takes us outside
on the other end.

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
natural looking snake

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that was not carved that points
to the entryway to this place.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing everything,
where the snake is,

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.151 align:middle line:84%
and the eyes, and all
this stuff like that,

00:49:30.151 --> 00:49:31.370 align:middle line:90%
and all the group is looking.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.790 align:middle line:90%
And one of the aunts come over.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.050 align:middle line:84%
She's got her arm
around me like this.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And she leans over and
says isn't it amazing.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.725 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:39.350 align:middle line:90%
What's amazing?

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:42.790 align:middle line:90%


00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I want to use
this name either because I

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:47.290 align:middle line:90%
don't have his permission.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But she says her, I
guess, it's their niece.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it is?

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.060 align:middle line:90%
No I, mean nephew.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.380 align:middle line:90%
It's her nephew.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And she says, oh well,
our nephew is blind.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.860 align:middle line:90%
He can't see anything.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.790 align:middle line:90%
But you can't tell.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't
know that about him.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Now I know.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.810 align:middle line:90%
But boy can he see internally.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we do
shamanistic work,

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:19.750 align:middle line:84%
he is the most visual person
I've ever seen inside.

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:24.070 align:middle line:84%
He can appear to me better
than anybody I've ever seen.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:25.460 align:middle line:90%
But he has no eyes.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It was funny going back
after she just told me that.

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And he's driving
the pickup truck.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.545 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the back
of his pickup truck.

00:50:34.545 --> 00:50:36.951 align:middle line:84%
I got a blind guy driving
over the road there.

00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:38.915 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:38.915 --> 00:50:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Life is weird.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.994 align:middle line:90%


00:50:45.994 --> 00:50:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's where
my wife got it.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.360 align:middle line:84%
My wife just stuck something
on the refrigerator

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.500 align:middle line:90%
that says life is weird.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>So when you were
explaining this,

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:02.390 align:middle line:84%
what I heard was that the
Mayans and the other Indians--

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Kahuna.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Kahuna.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>They're from Hawaii.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>They do it on their
teenagers when they enter--

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>When they reach puberty, yes.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>And then, what I heard was
when the psychic children go

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.510 align:middle line:84%
into puberty, some of
them do the calcium thing.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Some of them grow.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:24.190 align:middle line:84%
About 80% of them,
at least in China,

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:28.180 align:middle line:84%
grow calcium shields
around their pineal gland.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>So my question is
the woman just asked

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:32.760 align:middle line:90%
about doing it with children.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you do it
prepuberty, is there

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:40.830 align:middle line:84%
something to look out for
when they reach puberty?

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:43.584 align:middle line:84%
>>More than likely, if you
establish this into them

00:51:43.584 --> 00:51:45.000 align:middle line:84%
before they reach
puberty, they're

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.020 align:middle line:84%
not going to grow a calcium
shield, I'll bet you.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.005 align:middle line:90%
Now it's good for kids.

00:51:50.005 --> 00:51:53.650 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.650 --> 00:52:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Well let me take all that
back because I don't know.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.130 align:middle line:90%
They don't do it before puberty.

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:05.640 align:middle line:90%
So maybe you're not supposed to.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Because the reason
I'm asking the question

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:09.910 align:middle line:84%
is because I'm
making an assumption

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:15.080 align:middle line:84%
that the psychic kids
are having this going on.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, some of them,
well 80%, do the calcium.

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.070 align:middle line:90%
That's just an assumption of--

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Actually, the
children don't have

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:26.990 align:middle line:84%
this going on when they are,
like, five and six years old.

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.375 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that's where
they're incredibly psychic.

00:52:29.375 --> 00:52:33.720 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:36.106 align:middle line:84%
I've never really
thought of that.

00:52:36.106 --> 00:52:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
the children are doing.

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I do know that
what they're doing

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:44.290 align:middle line:90%
is nothing like we adults do.

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just like
in my conversation

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.610 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of
these psychic kids,

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:51.026 align:middle line:84%
they're pulling the energy in
through the fourth and fifth

00:52:51.026 --> 00:52:52.320 align:middle line:90%
lumbar, and they know it.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Coming in at 90 degrees.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.419 align:middle line:84%
And it goes straight
up the spine.

00:52:57.419 --> 00:52:58.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that anywhere else.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they have
some other way

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:04.490 align:middle line:84%
of linking the
brain to the heart.

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:07.057 align:middle line:84%
But once we reach puberty,
we have to do this.

00:53:07.057 --> 00:53:09.799 align:middle line:90%


00:53:09.799 --> 00:53:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Wow, that just sets up a
whole other thing of research.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.289 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:53:15.289 --> 00:53:16.580 align:middle line:90%
You just gave me a lot of work.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, when you're doing
this to someone else,

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:32.180 align:middle line:84%
are you physically or
internally seeing their chakra?

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Or are they seeing it
with the little fuzzies?

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>No, you have to see it.

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.940 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to see it.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.106 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, so you have to see it.

00:53:37.106 --> 00:53:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>You're actually
doing it for them.

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing it
yourself on yourself,

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.517 align:middle line:84%
you have to see this going
on inside your own head.

00:53:44.517 --> 00:53:45.350 align:middle line:90%
And you can do that.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>One more question from here.

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:52.540 align:middle line:90%
The same side.

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.998 align:middle line:84%
No, I was trying to figure
out what time is it.

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:55.850 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>10 to one.

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>10 to one?

00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Can I involve my kids
in the yesterday ceremony

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.900 align:middle line:90%
when they come back home?

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Is it appropriate for kids to
be involved sitting on the sides

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and doing all ohm
and hallelujah?

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh yeah.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh that procedure?

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Yesterday, yeah.

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Well all I know is that,
in Germany, they've turned it

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.700 align:middle line:90%
into a therapy plan in Germany.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And they take families
that are-- the person who

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:26.760 align:middle line:84%
started this who
came to a workshop,

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.760 align:middle line:90%
he told me my family is a mess.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.780 align:middle line:90%
And he say's his wife hates him.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:37.190 align:middle line:84%
One of his sons is trying
to, literally, kill him.

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And the whole family
is just a mess.

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:42.282 align:middle line:90%
And so he managed.

00:54:42.282 --> 00:54:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how he did that.

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But he managed to get
the family together.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And they did this whole thing.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, it completely
changed everything.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.824 align:middle line:84%
They started loving
each other again.

00:54:52.824 --> 00:54:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And so he was the one that
went out and started developing

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.690 align:middle line:90%
this to help other families.

00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:00.770 align:middle line:84%
He figured, probably, any
family I go to is probably not

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:01.630 align:middle line:90%
as bad as mine.

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:04.730 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's,
probably, a good thing.

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't done it
with families personally,

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.540 align:middle line:90%
so I don't know.

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.467 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's any
side effects or I don't know.

00:55:15.467 --> 00:55:16.008 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:16.008 --> 00:55:19.600 align:middle line:90%


00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you speak a little
bit about two [? lost ?]

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:26.610 align:middle line:90%
beams and chin chakra.

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>The chin chakra?

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>And the beam [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Well this is, again, if
a person is coming down

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:39.040 align:middle line:84%
from consciousness into a
lower place, it's what I did

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and all these
indigo kids that are

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.440 align:middle line:84%
here and the super psychic
kids, they're not from here.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.350 align:middle line:90%
They're not human.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:47.570 align:middle line:90%
They came from other places.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:49.440 align:middle line:90%
They're human now.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And they were coming down.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Those people arrive here
with this beam here.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But once they get here, and
they established themselves,

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and they get into human form,
they switch it over to here

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:02.410 align:middle line:84%
because now they're
going to go back up.

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the they
need-- well I know

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.330 align:middle line:84%
that switch it
because I've looked

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:16.000 align:middle line:90%
at lots of the Inigo kids.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But I do when they
first got here,

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.880 align:middle line:90%
this is where it would be.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.387 align:middle line:84%
The heart has 10
beams, not eight.

00:56:24.387 --> 00:56:26.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more I
haven't told you about.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.511 align:middle line:90%
There's three of these spheres.

00:56:27.511 --> 00:56:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's three of these
things around the body.

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk
about those later.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you
just try to make

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:35.615 align:middle line:90%
it as complicated as you can.

00:56:35.615 --> 00:56:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And you probably won't
even get close to what

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:40.360 align:middle line:90%
the human body does.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.002 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look
at the whole system.

00:56:43.002 --> 00:56:44.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at
the whole system

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.870 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see what it is.

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And we're not there yet.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm just
working with one set.

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But there is another one
that goes around the heart.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's another set that
goes around the genitals.

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's aimed at the
uterus, the creation process.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And the uterus can be used
in more ways than we know.

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll do is I'm going to
review this one more time just

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.660 align:middle line:90%
to take what we do.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.480 align:middle line:90%
And then, we're going to do it.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:18.837 align:middle line:84%
You'll get about 15 minutes
or so to go through it.

00:57:18.837 --> 00:57:19.920 align:middle line:90%
You'll do the whole thing.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.860 align:middle line:90%
See if you can do it.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll come after
that and ask questions

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.110 align:middle line:84%
because once you
actually do it, you'll

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:25.340 align:middle line:90%
realize what you don't know.

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.654 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:26.654 --> 00:57:35.920 align:middle line:90%


00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, you got the basics here.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:43.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, but begin with
this beam, number one.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:46.220 align:middle line:84%
We didn't go to
two left and right.

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:46.897 align:middle line:90%
Then, three.

00:57:46.897 --> 00:57:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Third eye.

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, four, you
don't have to do.

00:57:52.330 --> 00:58:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the procedure
is, again, you either

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.670 align:middle line:84%
can see or sense, or
feel these things.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's easier on
yourself sometimes

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:06.911 align:middle line:84%
than it is others
because you're just

00:58:06.911 --> 00:58:10.270 align:middle line:84%
going to be reaching up
here right in your own head.

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And you grab these things.

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:19.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're not sure,
just use your intuition.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.720 align:middle line:90%
And just do the best you can.

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:27.410 align:middle line:84%
This works on most people, even
if they don't really know how.

00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the gland
that we're working with.

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:34.860 align:middle line:84%
This pineal gland is a
pretty interesting thing.

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It functions through intention
more than anything else.

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So beginning with here, you
will work on this one this one.

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.800 align:middle line:90%
That's one, two, and three.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's up high on your head.

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:52.870 align:middle line:90%
And you need to find that spot.

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And you need to find the
spot back here to begin with.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And you need to know where
this left and right one is.

00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:01.030 align:middle line:84%
It's right where
your ears come out.

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little bit higher
and a tiny bit forward.

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you just aim toward
the center of your head,

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:07.860 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get there.

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the pineal chakra is
in the center of your breathing

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.460 align:middle line:90%
tube.

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're really,
kind of, aiming

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:17.110 align:middle line:90%
for the center of everything.

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland itself is just
a little bit back from there.

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:25.650 align:middle line:90%


00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, this spot
here is just one.

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:30.490 align:middle line:90%
It goes go up one.

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:32.477 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it is.

00:59:32.477 --> 00:59:33.810 align:middle line:90%
This is where your third eye is.

00:59:33.810 --> 00:59:36.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot in India,
you see them put the red dot

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:37.420 align:middle line:90%
way down lower.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.720 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing there.

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:41.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not correct.

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:42.840 align:middle line:90%
It's up here.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And later when we start talking
tomorrow or the next day

00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:50.110 align:middle line:84%
about reconnecting
the brain, this spot's

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:53.510 align:middle line:84%
going to be very
important because we

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:56.410 align:middle line:84%
are going to show you
exactly how to open

00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:59.660 align:middle line:90%
third eye, precisely what to do.

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And you have to know
where that spot is.

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
when people are learning

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.090 align:middle line:84%
is that they close their
eyes, and they're trying

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:07.340 align:middle line:90%
to look through the third eye.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But they're still looking
through these eyes.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why they
cross their eyes a little bit

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.000 align:middle line:84%
to look up because you've got
to get your focus up here, not

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.346 align:middle line:90%
down here.

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:17.970 align:middle line:84%
You really do have
two different levels

01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:20.550 align:middle line:90%
of where you can see from.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So back to this, you grab
those two fuzzy places.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can just about
tell you you're

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.070 align:middle line:90%
going to start back here.

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And you ask that one to grow.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And you keep getting
it to grow until it's

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.632 align:middle line:90%
about as wide as your hand.

01:00:39.632 --> 01:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Then, you come to
the one in front.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And you get that one about
as wide as your hand.

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, soon as
your body has created

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:49.250 align:middle line:84%
those beams even
that long, you switch

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and you put your hand
chakra right over the top

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:56.120 align:middle line:90%
so you can still do that.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you close
your eyes and look inside.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:05.065 align:middle line:84%
Now you can see your own
inner brain in front of you.

01:01:05.065 --> 01:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
You can psychically
see something.

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
You could even
look inside and see

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
in front of you what's in
your liver, or your kidneys,

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.800 align:middle line:90%
or anything else.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
looking at that thing.

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you look to find
the pineal chakra first.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.330 align:middle line:90%
See where it is.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, see or sense, or feel
these beams that are wiggling

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:33.450 align:middle line:90%
around it.

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And with your intention
while you're holding here,

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
you just keep getting those
beams to connect to that place.

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:44.586 align:middle line:84%
And you got to watch it
because they'll connect,

01:01:44.586 --> 01:01:45.590 align:middle line:90%
and they'll break away.

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And they'll connect,
and they'll break away.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:47.833 align:middle line:90%
And they'll connect.

01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And you have to hold them there.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Once they're connected,
really use your intention.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Just-- [STRAINING]
No, you can't move.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, after
about a minute or so,

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
you can then feel that
they're connected.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
You expand your hands
out, and come out.

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.960 align:middle line:90%


01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.955 align:middle line:84%
It's not your hands that
are really doing it.

01:02:12.955 --> 01:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It's your intention
that's doing it.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a little crooked
or something like that,

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
the body knows
what you're doing.

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:24.170 align:middle line:90%
And so you pull them out.

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have to sense
and feel that pulsing.

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And again, on yourself, you can
put your hands and sit on them

01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:35.065 align:middle line:90%
and just not even use them.

01:02:35.065 --> 01:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it all
just through intention.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:40.480 align:middle line:90%


01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And you wait until you
get that pulsing the same.

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, you count
20 or more pulses.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Literally count them
every time you feel it.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.530 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the
speed of the rate,

01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:57.800 align:middle line:84%
which is connected to
your heart, I believe,

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.240 align:middle line:90%
isn't important.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.365 align:middle line:84%
At least, not for
what we're doing here.

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So if it's going pulse, pulse,
pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.945 align:middle line:90%
or pulse, pulse.

01:03:05.945 --> 01:03:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Just count the pulses.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you get 20,
you can drop your hands,

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.590 align:middle line:90%
and you go to number two.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.090 align:middle line:90%
You do exactly the same thing.

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
And then, do to number three.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Do it three times,
and then you're done.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.860 align:middle line:90%


01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So is there any final
questions that you still

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.490 align:middle line:90%
don't understand?

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:33.320 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead,

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>When you say you
need to connect them,

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
they need to connect
to the pineal gland?

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Or they need to move energy
between the whole cube?

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Like, from back to forth or
through the pineal gland.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>No, I'm talking about
connecting these beams.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>One to another
like it becomes--

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>No, they don't
connect to each other.

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:56.840 align:middle line:84%
They connect to
the chakra point.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>And after they connect, energy
goes through, like, one beam,

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.280 align:middle line:90%
or it's not connected?

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Well the two beams
then become one beam.

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:06.840 align:middle line:90%
But it's polarized.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.852 align:middle line:90%
They function together.

01:04:08.852 --> 01:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you have four male
beams and four female beams.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Same way as on star tetrahedron.

01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>And what is the
connection between the line?

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>This?

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>It connects in
the pineal chakra.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.931 align:middle line:90%


01:04:29.931 --> 01:04:31.180 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean between them?

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>If there is any
energetic connection

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.652 align:middle line:90%
through all the line.

01:04:36.652 --> 01:04:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>You mean from here to here?

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, they're functioning
as one single unit.

01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, thank you.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>But these other ones are
functioning as one single unit

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:52.610 align:middle line:84%
separately from this
one, as I understand it.

01:04:52.610 --> 01:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But since they've been described
to me as antenna or antennae,

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:05.534 align:middle line:84%
I guess by their
angles or what, they

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:06.700 align:middle line:90%
reach different frequencies.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
What they're put
there bringing-- well

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
get into that yet.

01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:17.618 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get into the
imagery and how it works yet.

01:05:17.618 --> 01:05:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I can hardly see out of here.

01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you're
there, sort of.

01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>My question is, at
the beginning of this,

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:31.720 align:middle line:84%
we're just starting to pull
the tubes away from the head.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, we do
this middle work.

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, we come back
after we've, sort of,

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.950 align:middle line:90%
seen these impulses balance out.

01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have
us pull it further.

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Is there a reason why we're
not just pulling it out

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%
to the halo there?

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why we
just pull it out a few inches,

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.489 align:middle line:90%
and then do this--

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, you mean why do you do it
first a little bit and then--

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Right, yes.

01:05:55.070 --> 01:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>As I understand, it's to get
the body used to putting out

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.410 align:middle line:90%
a large amount of energy.

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not used to it.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long time
probably-- thousands of years,

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
more than likely--
since you've done this.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.240 align:middle line:90%
And the body doesn't know.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the pineal gland, it's
real function, the pineal gland

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
should be, from
what I'm being told,

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:23.260 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same size as one
of these eyes and more round.

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is an eye,
literally, scientifically.

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:29.720 align:middle line:90%
It is hollow.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It has color receptors
inside of it.

01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
It has a lens on it
for receiving light.

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is Jacob
Liberman's work with Light:

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Medicine of the Future.

01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of the
most advanced people

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.070 align:middle line:90%
in eyes and light in the world.

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:46.610 align:middle line:90%


01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's entropy down to,
like, a pea or something.

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:52.910 align:middle line:90%
We haven't used it.

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:56.341 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if you start
using it, it's going to grow.

01:06:56.341 --> 01:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Just like a muscle
or anything else,

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.280 align:middle line:90%
it's going to get stronger.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is the lens
is facing up this way.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.110 align:middle line:90%
It's looking right up the tube.

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's designed to
receive light from above.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And these eyes are facing at 90
degrees looking out this way.

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:16.880 align:middle line:90%


01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
But it is, literally,
an eyeball.

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:21.910 align:middle line:90%
It has other functions.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:24.110 align:middle line:90%
But that's one of them.

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that when I
was working with Jacob Liberman

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
that he showed me, which
was really-- this guy

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:35.120 align:middle line:90%
really knows a lot about this.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But they've tracked exactly
when light goes in the eyes

01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
exactly where it goes and
precisely the whole method.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
But right after it
leaves the pineal gland,

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
it literally, according
to Jacob Liberman,

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:52.010 align:middle line:84%
It goes to every single
cell in the body.

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And he says, from the
way that they see it now,

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
every cell in your body is
looking at exactly what you're

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:01.092 align:middle line:90%
looking at.

01:08:01.092 --> 01:08:05.064 align:middle line:90%
And that changes things.

01:08:05.064 --> 01:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
All these guys in here are
looking at what I'm looking at?

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
He says the light actually
enters into every single cell.

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.490 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:17.243 align:middle line:90%
But that's what he says.

01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:17.743 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:20.629 align:middle line:90%


01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:23.389 align:middle line:84%
>>One thing that you
mentioned this morning

01:08:23.389 --> 01:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think
you just mentioned

01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
now is when you first grab the
fuzzy things at the beginning

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.135 align:middle line:84%
that you need to actually
ask them to turn into a beam

01:08:31.135 --> 01:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
before you start
stretching them?

01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>Well that's your intention.

01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:35.979 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Your intention is that when
you grab those fuzzy things,

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and you hold onto them, and you
put your thumb and first finger

01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
together so that you get
the right size, that's

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:51.649 align:middle line:84%
what you want to do is
get the proper size.

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:54.029 align:middle line:84%
And then, you tell
it to go into a beam.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.345 align:middle line:90%
It'll do that instantly.

01:08:55.345 --> 01:08:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, OK.

01:08:57.010 --> 01:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>There's no problem
with the body doing that.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is that, once
you do that, then you have

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.800 align:middle line:90%
to pull it and get it stronger.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.931 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you may see
some resistance from your body.

01:09:08.931 --> 01:09:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Once you've done it
one time, and then you

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.569 align:middle line:84%
go to do it with these, the
body goes, OK, I got it.

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And it'll go a lot faster.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But the time you do the third
one, it'll go-- [ZIP] You know,

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
it'll really fast
because now it knows

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:22.770 align:middle line:90%
what you're talking about.

01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But it may not agree
with you, meaning

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:32.189 align:middle line:84%
that it seems to me
that the body just

01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:38.060 align:middle line:84%
has a hard time believing it
that the source of the body,

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
which we're like
God to the body,

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:42.600 align:middle line:84%
wants that much energy to come
out because it isn't done it

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.390 align:middle line:90%
in so long.

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:46.500 align:middle line:90%
But it learns.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And then after awhile,
it gets used to it.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:54.090 align:middle line:90%
And there's not a problem.

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:55.975 align:middle line:90%
OK, any other questions?

01:09:55.975 --> 01:09:58.770 align:middle line:90%


01:09:58.770 --> 01:09:59.762 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, OK.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So the negative side,
which is the left side,

01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
goes to the positive
side of the tube.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.910 align:middle line:90%
It works that way.

01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Just think of it
as male and female.

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And is the positive side,
could that be weaker

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
than the negative side?

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:23.299 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, it can be.

01:10:23.299 --> 01:10:24.715 align:middle line:84%
Well definitely,
like, when you're

01:10:24.715 --> 01:10:26.600 align:middle line:84%
going left and right
side, you never

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
know which side's
going to be stronger

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:30.600 align:middle line:84%
because some people
focus more on one side

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.140 align:middle line:90%
of the brain than the other.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>I see.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.470 align:middle line:90%
So how do you detect it?

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.710 align:middle line:90%
You just pick one?

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Well if you're
sensitive, you can feel it.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:46.637 align:middle line:84%
If you can't feel it,
then, yeah, pick one.

01:10:46.637 --> 01:10:48.445 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, thank you.

01:10:48.445 --> 01:10:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>If you don't know which ones
weaker, just start with one.

01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:59.480 align:middle line:90%


01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.752 align:middle line:90%
No, that's it?

01:11:00.752 --> 01:11:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Is everyone's
left hand negative?

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, then let's just do this.

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's practice it.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Do the best you can.

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry if you're
going to fail or not.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Or who cares.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:16.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just go for it.

01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Getting hot under these lights.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Just go for it, and
do the best you can.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.425 align:middle line:84%
And then, you will see
where your weaknesses are

01:11:24.425 --> 01:11:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and what you know
and don't know.

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:28.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll have another discussion.

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you 15
minutes because that's usually

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.506 align:middle line:84%
plenty enough time
to do this one time.

01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll have another
discussion after that.

01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:38.310 align:middle line:90%


01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:42.620 align:middle line:90%
So you ready?

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.567 align:middle line:90%
Go.

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:47.062 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:11:47.062 --> 01:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%


01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Well most of you are done.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.580 align:middle line:90%
But some you are still working.

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:21.850 align:middle line:90%
So keep working.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:25.995 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure the levels that
you're at because some of them

01:15:25.995 --> 01:15:28.184 align:middle line:90%
are on the side.

01:15:28.184 --> 01:15:34.260 align:middle line:90%
At any rate, just keep working.

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.035 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask if
anybody has questions.

01:15:37.035 --> 01:15:39.860 align:middle line:90%


01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Something you didn't
understand that you discovered

01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:44.480 align:middle line:90%
when you were trying to do it.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.850 align:middle line:90%


01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So at least you could
feel the pulsing.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Some people can't
feel the pulsing.

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you have to see the pineal
gland or can you just sense it?

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:02.237 align:middle line:84%
>>No, you can see it, sense
it, or feel it always.

01:16:02.237 --> 01:16:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll just
say see something.

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:06.755 align:middle line:84%
But I always mean you can
see it, sense it, or feel it.

01:16:06.755 --> 01:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>So you just
sense these things.

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:16:09.710 --> 01:16:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>In fact, now
that I've told you

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
how to do this in a
male way, the females

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
could just to sit there
and just say do it.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And it'll work, depending
on how much in touch

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.330 align:middle line:90%
they are where their female way.

01:16:27.330 --> 01:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
is too is that you'll

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
discover after you get used to
this more-- after a week or two

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
or so you'll get used to
it-- and you'll probably

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:47.400 align:middle line:84%
find that certain negative
emotions, like rage, things

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
like this where you get really
mad, or upset, or really even

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
really depressed or the
different things that can cause

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.670 align:middle line:84%
these things, even
though they're working,

01:16:56.670 --> 01:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
they might go off their
axis a little bit.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.530 align:middle line:84%
It gets stronger over
time but in the beginning.

01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And to fix it, you
just close your eyes,

01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and you see the whole
thing, and just say fix it.

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.090 align:middle line:90%
You know, you just say go back.

01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And everything goes.

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Takes like one second.

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It really responds to
the intention like crazy.

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But definitely every time
you're about to do a healing

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
in someone when we get
all the way through this

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and you see what
these are and you're

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
working with somebody
else, or you're

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
going to do something
psychically or any

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
of those kinds of
levels, you just

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
want to take one second to feel
the flow through your Merkaba

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and one second see
that all of this

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:44.930 align:middle line:84%
is perfect before
you begin because it

01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:49.420 align:middle line:90%
does you can get knocked off.

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:53.230 align:middle line:90%
You can get slightly moved.

01:17:53.230 --> 01:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And just by the intention of
saying do that, it happens.

01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I can't see.

01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Whoever's doing this--

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:10.345 align:middle line:84%
>>My question is that I feel
that [INAUDIBLE] frequencies

01:18:10.345 --> 01:18:13.740 align:middle line:90%
two times slow than heartbeat.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand my question?

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, I do.

01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you're
feeling is heartbeat

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.710 align:middle line:90%
is twice as fast then, right?

01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly?

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Well maybe it's in over
tone of it then or something.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>It's OK, no.

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>But it's tied to it, I think.

01:18:32.650 --> 01:18:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done this
work because it's not

01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:39.120 align:middle line:84%
essential for what I'm doing
right now to know if it's

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.700 align:middle line:90%
linked to the heartbeat or not.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
If I come to a place
where I need to know that,

01:18:43.710 --> 01:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
then I have to sit down,
and do all the work,

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and find out for sure.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I don't really
care because it doesn't really

01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:55.232 align:middle line:84%
make any difference
in the bigger picture

01:18:55.232 --> 01:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%
whether it's tied
to the heartbeat,

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
or certain biorhythms,
or something else.

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.480 align:middle line:90%


01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But what I know for
certain, it's not even

01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
a matter of doubt, is that
this whole thing is intimately

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:11.340 align:middle line:84%
connected to the heart in the
sacred place of the heart.

01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:12.772 align:middle line:84%
When we lay out
the whole pattern,

01:19:12.772 --> 01:19:14.480 align:middle line:84%
we're going to show
you the whole mapping

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:15.604 align:middle line:90%
before you get out of this.

01:19:15.604 --> 01:19:19.270 align:middle line:84%
You'll understand how
when an image is created

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
exactly where it goes, how
it goes, where it goes,

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
what it does, and how it gets
out into this world out here.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.084 align:middle line:84%
You'll know the whole thing
before you get out of here.

01:19:28.084 --> 01:19:32.680 align:middle line:90%


01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who's next.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:40.884 align:middle line:84%
Olivia, she's just
handing it to people.

01:19:40.884 --> 01:19:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the pulsing.

01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]?

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, what happens is you'll
discover after a little while

01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that the pulsing that's
on all these things

01:19:50.610 --> 01:19:52.180 align:middle line:90%
are all simultaneously.

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll eventually become
all simultaneously.

01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And when the sphere appears, the
whole sphere will be pulsing.

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:08.910 align:middle line:90%


01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>When I activated it
and it all connected,

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.740 align:middle line:84%
it felt like I had
a hat on my head.

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, it does kind
of feel like a hat.

01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And then, the pulsing, the
first one turned on at 24,

01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:25.470 align:middle line:84%
the second at 16,
and the third at 24.

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, the pulsing itself
is an exact synchronicity

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.342 align:middle line:90%
with my heartbeat.

01:20:33.342 --> 01:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
My heart is beating at
the same as this pulsing.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I think it is.

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>My third eye was
also pulsing, which--

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Well yeah, that third eye is
the generator of this pulse.

01:20:45.610 --> 01:20:50.016 align:middle line:90%


01:20:50.016 --> 01:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>I just want make sure I
have the order of steps right.

01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So you do the short
stem as it were.

01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, you connect
it to the pineal chakra.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.080 align:middle line:90%
You start here.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.801 align:middle line:90%
Get the shorter of the two.

01:21:09.801 --> 01:21:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Get them so they're both same.

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] to palm length.

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm hm.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>And then, connect
to the pineal chakra.

01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, you make
them the proper length.

01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And then, you fix the pulsing?

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:20.925 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, that's right.

01:21:20.925 --> 01:21:21.425 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:21:21.425 --> 01:21:22.963 align:middle line:84%
And is there any
amount of time you

01:21:22.963 --> 01:21:25.397 align:middle line:84%
have to hold any
one of those steps

01:21:25.397 --> 01:21:26.605 align:middle line:90%
for a certain amount of time?

01:21:26.605 --> 01:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Like another pulsing, you have
to wait for 20 or 25 pulses.

01:21:29.230 --> 01:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
For any of the
three sets before,

01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:34.952 align:middle line:84%
do you have to wait any set
amount of time for it to hold?

01:21:34.952 --> 01:21:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, to hold?

01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:38.425 align:middle line:90%
Set it on a timer?

01:21:38.425 --> 01:21:40.852 align:middle line:84%
>>No, do you have to, like,
after you've made one of them

01:21:40.852 --> 01:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
palm length, you have to wait
for a certain amount of time?

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, do you have
to wait a minute?

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.696 align:middle line:84%
Or can you just
go on to the next?

01:21:45.696 --> 01:21:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh no, you can
go immediately on.

01:21:47.650 --> 01:21:48.950 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to wait.

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you do it, instantly,
you can go to the next one.

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, for the last one,
you wait for 20 pulses or so.

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, each one, you have
to wait till your 20 pulses.

01:21:57.630 --> 01:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But after 20, after
you've done the pulsing,

01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
you can drop and immediately
go to the next one

01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:03.020 align:middle line:90%
soon as you're done.

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:09.540 align:middle line:90%


01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And I just recommend you do
this once a day for the next two

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:14.570 align:middle line:90%
weeks.

01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:19.290 align:middle line:84%
In two weeks, this should
become more familiar.

01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's also more
familiar for your body.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:27.070 align:middle line:90%


01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:31.317 align:middle line:84%
But in itself, it
doesn't do much.

01:22:31.317 --> 01:22:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Just same like with the Merkaba.

01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
In itself, the Merkaba
doesn't do much.

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you hook the Merkaba
and this to the heart,

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.400 align:middle line:84%
then you're really
talking about something

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that is the most powerful
thing in the universe.

01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:48.150 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more
powerful than this.

01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:50.816 align:middle line:84%
If it is, I don't
know what it is.

01:22:50.816 --> 01:22:53.275 align:middle line:84%
It's so powerful,
I can't see it.

01:22:53.275 --> 01:22:55.135 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:55.135 --> 01:22:56.070 align:middle line:90%


01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Just a little clarification.

01:22:57.850 --> 01:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
When you've done the first
stretch to palm width

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and then you move
to your chakras

01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're working
on the wiggles,

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:06.270 align:middle line:90%
are you back on the head?

01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Or are you at the end of the
tube where you stretched it to?

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, OK You grab the beams.

01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Get them both so
they're both that way.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Connect the beams inside.

01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Pull them out.

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.892 align:middle line:90%
And then, get the pulsing.

01:23:21.892 --> 01:23:24.981 align:middle line:84%
>>But when you're working on
the wiggles inside the head--

01:23:24.981 --> 01:23:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, inside, yes.

01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:28.005 align:middle line:84%
>>Are your hands at the
end of the tube that you

01:23:28.005 --> 01:23:28.630 align:middle line:90%
just stretched?

01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>No, that's when your
hands are on the head.

01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>They're on the head.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:31.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, I didn't get that.

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>They're on the head itself.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.786 align:middle line:90%


01:23:34.786 --> 01:23:39.267 align:middle line:84%
>>I really want to get this
clear because a few months

01:23:39.267 --> 01:23:41.600 align:middle line:84%
from now, you're going to
realize how important this is.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And you may want to
help other people.

01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>So [INAUDIBLE]?

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, you want to
actually hold the head.

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:52.672 align:middle line:84%
Your chakra here is the same
size as these down here.

01:23:52.672 --> 01:23:54.005 align:middle line:90%
And it's right here in the palm.

01:23:54.005 --> 01:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a really powerful
chakra in your hands

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and your feet, too.

01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:00.085 align:middle line:84%
>>So while it's coming
out up to the circle,

01:24:00.085 --> 01:24:02.560 align:middle line:90%
its going through [INAUDIBLE]?

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, you have a cone
coming out both sides.

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you mean the beam?

01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:10.493 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, the beam is sticking
right through your hand.

01:24:10.493 --> 01:24:11.034 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:24:11.034 --> 01:24:14.200 align:middle line:90%


01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, at the very end,
your intention, you pull out.

01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
You go past, and
it'll go to the point

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.202 align:middle line:90%
where the beam is already out.

01:24:21.202 --> 01:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, as your hand
goes out, the beam

01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:24.454 align:middle line:84%
will just follow
right behind it.

01:24:24.454 --> 01:24:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, so my hand
goes out with it.

01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
As you do this, go in,
get the beams connected,

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.650 align:middle line:84%
then the beams are
out a little ways.

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:37.483 align:middle line:84%
But as you pull it out
and you go past here,

01:24:37.483 --> 01:24:39.380 align:middle line:90%
they'll just follow you.

01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And when they get to this
exact geographical location

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:45.140 align:middle line:90%
of this sphere, they will stop.

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.755 align:middle line:84%
And then, your hands
might go farther.

01:24:46.755 --> 01:24:48.338 align:middle line:84%
Your hands could go
that much farther.

01:24:48.338 --> 01:24:49.660 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But the beam will stop precisely
where that sphere will be.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.681 align:middle line:90%
Sphere's not there yet.

01:24:57.681 --> 01:24:58.972 align:middle line:90%
>>What's it called [INAUDIBLE]?

01:24:58.972 --> 01:25:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Does it have a name?

01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, I'm sure the Tibetans
have a name for it.

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And maybe the Mayans do too.

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.980 align:middle line:84%
But I just called them
the beams of light.

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And my job is to
translate everything

01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:19.820 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient levels into
modern day context's so we

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.950 align:middle line:84%
could make sense of it
because a lot of the stuff,

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
you say samadhi, it doesn't
make sense to people.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
know what that means.

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:35.711 align:middle line:84%
>>My question is could you
just summarize one more time

01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:36.210 align:middle line:90%
for us--

01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, sure.

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>--the brief steps.

01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I became
unclear about when

01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I went to the pineal
chakra was did

01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I look for all those
squigglies at the same time

01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
or just the squigglies
on the beam?

01:25:53.490 --> 01:25:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>No, you eliminate all
squigglies or wigglies,

01:25:57.190 --> 01:25:59.680 align:middle line:84%
except for the ones
you're working with.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's intention, too.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Intention does that.

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it in
science, just like Bob

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.120 align:middle line:84%
with that little thing
I was talking about,

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.720 align:middle line:90%
his device that he can see into.

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:17.250 align:middle line:84%
We would take a bowl of
pennies, three pennies in it,

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:17.830 align:middle line:90%
and shake it.

01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And just the pennies
when they hit each other,

01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:23.262 align:middle line:84%
the molecules would vibrate like
crazy and produce microwaves.

01:26:23.262 --> 01:26:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it on
the computer screen

01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:27.490 align:middle line:90%
when you did that.

01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And so one of his demonstrations
was he would take,

01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:34.160 align:middle line:84%
basically, a photograph
but it's more than that.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
A photograph of a
bowl pennies, which

01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:40.740 align:middle line:84%
would go all the way to
the most distant stars as

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.780 align:middle line:90%
far back as forever.

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
was picked on there.

01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, he would
take everything other

01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:50.510 align:middle line:84%
than the bowl and the
pennies, and erase it.

01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:53.890 align:middle line:84%
He can now track that bowl
anywhere in the world.

01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And he was demonstrating this.

01:26:55.150 --> 01:26:56.490 align:middle line:90%
It was so cool.

01:26:56.490 --> 01:26:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he could take the
bowl of the three pennies

01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and have somebody walk two miles
away, and hide behind a rock.

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, at a certain time
you say OK, now, and shake him,

01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and you would see
it on the screen.

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you can
go over the horizon.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.820 align:middle line:84%
You can even get the
entire earth between you.

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:16.469 align:middle line:10%
That much mass and
still pick them up

01:27:16.469 --> 01:27:17.760 align:middle line:10%
on the other side of the earth.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.220 align:middle line:10%
You can't lose them because
he'll erase everything else

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:22.830 align:middle line:10%
and it isn't there.

01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:25.484 align:middle line:84%
And so you're doing a
similar kind of thing.

01:27:25.484 --> 01:27:27.900 align:middle line:84%
You're going to erase everything
else that's going on here

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.410 align:middle line:90%
and only look at those.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.720 align:middle line:90%
And so you won't see these.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>You won't even
know they're there.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.630 align:middle line:90%
You'll only see just the two.

01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>So you only deal with those
when you come to that beam.

01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, just the
ones with that beam.

01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Forget about all
the other beams.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Just one at the time.

01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:48.080 align:middle line:90%
And only see those.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would
be really hard.

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.686 align:middle line:84%
There's so many little
wiggly worms in there.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, two of them is enough.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So how many people could
feel when they would connect?

01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel when they connect?

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.731 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like--
[BOOM] You can feel them

01:28:06.731 --> 01:28:07.480 align:middle line:90%
when they connect.

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And then, they freak out.

01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:12.330 align:middle line:90%
And they won't break apart.

01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And you have to do it several
times before they feel

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:16.210 align:middle line:90%
like they're safe or something.

01:28:16.210 --> 01:28:17.209 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:20.870 align:middle line:90%


01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:22.905 align:middle line:84%
I don't really
understand it exactly.

01:28:22.905 --> 01:28:25.457 align:middle line:90%
Anymore questions on this?

01:28:25.457 --> 01:28:27.165 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll go on
to another subject.

01:28:27.165 --> 01:28:32.220 align:middle line:90%


01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:33.654 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

01:28:33.654 --> 01:28:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I heard that fluoride
calcifies the pineal gland.

01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>So you think that
fluoride is the reason why

01:28:40.170 --> 01:28:41.901 align:middle line:90%
this calcium is building up?

01:28:41.901 --> 01:28:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, that's what I
heard, [INAUDIBLE].

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>I know, it's a bad thing.

01:28:45.710 --> 01:28:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Fluorine and chlorine.

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing they put
two poisons in our water.

01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Chlorine is really bad, too.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.780 align:middle line:90%
They're both really bad.

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't use fluoride anything.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And I don't drink chloride
ever, if I can help it.

01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:08.410 align:middle line:90%


01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the United Nations
has put-- exactly where

01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:20.470 align:middle line:84%
it's coming from-- the United
Nations is determined to reduce

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:22.670 align:middle line:90%
the population of the world.

01:29:22.670 --> 01:29:24.240 align:middle line:90%
They started with AIDS.

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:25.400 align:middle line:90%
They created AIDS.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I could prove it in court.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.020 align:middle line:90%
They started AIDS.

01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Strecker, probably old
AIDS patients, if they're still

01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:36.280 align:middle line:90%
alive, would remember him.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And he shows how exactly
they took the retro

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
virus from a sheep and a cow
and blended them together.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.140 align:middle line:84%
He went on a because he
was one of the team members

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.319 align:middle line:90%
that did it.

01:29:47.319 --> 01:29:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And they went through
the whole thing

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and showed exactly
the whole formula

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:53.120 align:middle line:90%
exactly how they created AIDS.

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, he announced
on that video

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:03.080 align:middle line:90%
that they had the cure also.

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
he then shows up

01:30:05.890 --> 01:30:07.410 align:middle line:84%
the letter from
the United Nations

01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:09.920 align:middle line:84%
showing that because
of overpopulation

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and what it means and
you can understand

01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that there's been many computer
models on overpopulation.

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But they all end up,
basically, the same.

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of how
many people we get to.

01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Most of them break down
completely at about 12 billion.

01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we're rethinking
a lot of this

01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:31.080 align:middle line:84%
because we're just
approaching seven billion,

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're starting
to break down.

01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But then, after that,
all life on earth dies.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:42.960 align:middle line:84%
We kill the planet
by our activity.

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the United
Nations has declared,

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:48.390 align:middle line:90%
well, we can't do this.

01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And so they are attempting
to reduce the population.

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:58.300 align:middle line:84%
That piece of paper
that Dr. Striker showed,

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.990 align:middle line:84%
which was from the actual United
Nations stating all of this and

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:03.120 align:middle line:90%
signed by them.

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to reduce
the population by 75%.

01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:08.150 align:middle line:90%
They've changed that now.

01:31:08.150 --> 01:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So now they want to
reduce it by 90%.

01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's your intention.

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they're doing
all kinds of things

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:17.230 align:middle line:90%
to reduce the population.

01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is they
change the chlorine

01:31:19.650 --> 01:31:21.470 align:middle line:90%
that goes in the water.

01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:24.319 align:middle line:84%
And I got this straight
from certain members

01:31:24.319 --> 01:31:25.360 align:middle line:90%
of the secret government.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
they told me this.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But I had it verified by
certain chemists in Japan.

01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:34.380 align:middle line:90%
And it blew their minds, too.

01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:38.570 align:middle line:84%
The chlorine molecule, it
has one extra atom on it.

01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And that one extra atom
causes Alzheimer's disease.

01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Only, it's not a normal one.

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It goes normal for a while.

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, it accelerates
500 times faster

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.910 align:middle line:90%
and kills the person.

01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have an epidemic of
that in the world right now.

01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's from the water we're
drinking and the chlorine.

01:31:58.170 --> 01:32:00.240 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to a
point here pretty soon

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.280 align:middle line:84%
when just massive
amounts of people

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.877 align:middle line:90%
are going to die from this.

01:32:03.877 --> 01:32:05.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they want to do.

01:32:05.210 --> 01:32:08.160 align:middle line:84%
They want to get rid of as
much as possible in order

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:08.940 align:middle line:90%
to save the world.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:13.520 align:middle line:90%


01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And even like the AIDS
virus, they already

01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:17.159 align:middle line:90%
have the cure for it.

01:32:17.159 --> 01:32:17.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a light.

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I have it, too.

01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:21.290 align:middle line:84%
We have a light that you can
shine it on AIDS and it's gone.

01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:23.220 align:middle line:90%
They don't have it anymore.

01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:25.662 align:middle line:84%
But the government
took it from us.

01:32:25.662 --> 01:32:26.870 align:middle line:90%
We still know how to make it.

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:27.700 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty simple.

01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Well it's not actually simple.

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:31.460 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty complex, actually.

01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:36.570 align:middle line:84%
But we had a light that would
cure every single disease

01:32:36.570 --> 01:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
in the world within
two minutes, usually.

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:41.934 align:middle line:84%
And they took all
that stuff from us.

01:32:41.934 --> 01:32:43.600 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
reduce the population.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
it to grow faster.

01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:57.259 align:middle line:90%
