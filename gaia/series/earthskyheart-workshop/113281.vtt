00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Welcome to the American
Southwest and the red rocks

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.630 align:middle line:84%
of Sedona, Arizona where we
begin the Earth/Sky/Heart

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Workshop with author and
teacher Drunvalo Melchizedek.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm Drunvalo Melchizedek, and
welcome to the Earth/Sky/Heart

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Workshop.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll be guiding you through this
film as you learn the material.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.350 align:middle line:84%
There'll be several
sacred ceremonies

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that you will be
experiencing through here,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and many meditations that you
will have to learn and practice

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:90%
as you do this.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Take the time.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.076 align:middle line:84%
Be part of these ceremonies,
and be part of the material

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:90%
that you're learning.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Because you need to not
just see it and know it,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:84%
but you need to actually learn
it and live it and breathe it.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to introduce you
to the Creative Life Center.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.900 align:middle line:84%
In the main room there's
120 people from countries

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
that are participating.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
You will slowly meet these
people as they ask questions

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and as they participate
through the workshop.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.293 align:middle line:84%
They came here as just
friends and people

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:90%
that barely knew each other.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And over five days
they became very close,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
almost like a family,
through this experience.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
We filmed this using
state-off-the-art cameras

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and equipment, hoping to enhance
your experience through these

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:90%
next five days.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So relax, get comfortable,
and don't be serious.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
It's better if you approach
this as a little child,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and just relax and not think
of everything as so important,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that you have to learn
it or you have to know it

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:90%
and you have to do it right.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Just be there.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Be present.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Open your heart.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And it'll all come to.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
You will all understand
it over time,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and you will remember
who you really are.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:84%
May this work that happens
over the next five days

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
be a blessing in your life
and all those that you love.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get started with day
one, the day of the opening.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:90%
Good morning, everyone.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.179 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:14.055 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Hollywood.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're in Arizona,
Sedona, Arizona.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.892 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
Earth/Sky/Heart Workshop.

00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be--
I don't think they probably

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.568 align:middle line:84%
told you this-- but this is
going to be the last one ever.

00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
You are at the
very, very last one.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember in 1994, I was
doing the Flower of Life,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and I did that
from 1984 to 1994.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, I realized, wow.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.806 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And then other
people took it on.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
There was about 350 facilitators
that went around the world

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:90%
to teach it.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.145 align:middle line:84%
And then after that I
realized, well, there

00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:58.605 align:middle line:90%
was all kinds of missing stuff.

00:02:58.605 --> 00:02:59.273 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:02:59.273 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
There were things that I
forgot to put in the book.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.786 align:middle line:90%
I thought I did, but I didn't.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there
was a lot of stuff

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:90%
that I've learned over time.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
The evolution just kept going.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And so this workshop has evolved
pretty dramatically, especially

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:90%
in the last two or three years.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
we have permission

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:90%
to change everything.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Now for you who have
started with the Merkaba,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:90%
this is perfect.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:90%
This is exactly what you need.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the future,
starting in July,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do
something very different.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
It actually isn't different in
the context-- in the content.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the way that
it is delivered.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Initially, it was decided
by the ascended masters

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't deliver
this information the way

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:90%
that they always had.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Meaning they gave it
first to the female--

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.235 align:middle line:84%
from the female point
of view, and then

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:90%
from the male point of view.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%
And so they began with a heart.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:90%
That's where they started.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
They didn't talk
about the Merkaba.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba wasn't
the first thing.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It was the last thing
that was discussed.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's still true
in Tibetan Buddhism.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're studying
Tibetan Buddhism,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
you don't know
about the Merkaba.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to die first before
you can find out about it.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:90%
You have to die 13 times.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to go
through 13 lifetimes

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
before they even
discuss that with you.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And then finally they
do, and they put you up

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
on a-- usually like 17,000,
20,000 feet in the air where

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:84%
it's about 100 below zero, and
they put wet blankets on you.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
You're naked, and they
put wet blankets on you

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:90%
and they say, hope you live.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And you've got about 10
seconds to do it right.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And all you do is you program
your Merkaba that within it,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:84%
it's whatever temperature you
set at, it is that temperature.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And you will melt the
circle, out their teachers

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:90%
can see that taking place.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they know
that you knew,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
or you know what
you're talking about.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.825 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, you die.

00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but I don't know
if anybody's ever died.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:90%
You can actually get that.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.310 align:middle line:90%
You can buy that video.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
They actually--
which is hard for me

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
to believe-- but the
Tibetans allowed them,

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
which was about seven
years ago or so,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.942 align:middle line:84%
to video an actual
monk doing this.

00:05:33.942 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
with the Discovery

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.947 align:middle line:84%
Channel or the History Channel,
one of those kind of channels.

00:05:38.947 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:90%
It would take a little research.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.321 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you can find it.

00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:84%
But you can get it and
see this happening.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, when the ascended
masters first put this out,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:84%
which was about roughly 1980,
before I started teaching,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
they gave it out
through the female way,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and nobody showed
up but females.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
There'd be, like, a room
full of females and one guy

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.540 align:middle line:84%
back in the corner, chewing
his fingernails, you know?

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And nobody-- nobody came.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Not both sides of the
coin, they didn't come.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear after
about three or four years

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:90%
that this was not working.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
because when we fell

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and because of a lot
of influences from ETs

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and other kinds of things
that were going on,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
we evolved almost totally
left brained and logical.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So now we're just a
completely-- we're,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:90%
like, becoming Dr. Spock.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:90%
We're becoming a male race.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And so it was decided to switch
over and reverse this and begin

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:90%
with the Merkaba.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And they waited
until-- they knew

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
it would happen, that eventually
we would discover crystals,

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.140 align:middle line:90%
which we did.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we all got
into these crystals.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
whole movement.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.415 align:middle line:90%
Wow, wow.

00:07:03.415 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Look at crystals.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And they started
realizing they're alive.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, they
look inside and they

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:90%
see all the geometries.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, that's when
we introduced sacred geometry

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:90%
in 1984.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the men were attracted
to this because it was logical

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and it made sense, and
so it pulled the men.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:90%
And that was required.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't just do the women.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We had to do both the
men and the women.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that worked, and
it's been continuing up.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But it had a lot of side effects
that normally don't happen.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we introduced something
as sacred as the Merkaba

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
while people still
had these huge egos,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
it caused people to
take it, run with it,

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
change it, make all
kinds of changes in it

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:90%
that you can't do.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
You can't change even
one tiny thing in it,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:90%
or it doesn't work.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's just exactly like
"The Torah," where in the Torah

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
if you change one letter,
you can throw away

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
the book because it
doesn't represent

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.550 align:middle line:90%
what it was trying to put out.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:90%
And this is the same way.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
It has to be done in
this particular way.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:84%
It took billions of years to
get there, and a lot of life

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:90%
was lost.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Whole planets were
destroyed because they

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:84%
were attempting to do
something that didn't work.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it's-- and the other
reason you can't change it is

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:84%
because the Earth,
all the planets,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and the sun are all rotating
with a tetrahedral Merkaba

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:90%
at 34 21.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.295 align:middle line:84%
And so if you use
any other Merkaba

00:08:41.295 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to go
through ascension to higher

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, you have a
problem because you're not

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
in harmony and in
frequency with the Earth,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and she's the one that's
going to do this ascension.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.822 align:middle line:90%
It's not you.

00:08:56.822 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
You may think you're doing
it, but she's doing it.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And you need to be
in harmony with her

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
as you move through
these various levels

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
When we get to the
fourth dimension,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
she's going to change her
Merkaba to something else.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what she's
going to change it to?

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.479 align:middle line:90%
She's a woman.

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:90%
She'll do anything.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
she's going to do.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
We know all the options
that she could do.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But what she's going to do and
actually do, we'll find out.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, ours will
also change automatically.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:90%
We will map right with her.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:90%
She makes all these changes.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Anyway all this for
the last 10 years

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:84%
has had certain problems
that we've never seen before.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
But we've made it to
this point, and we

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.670 align:middle line:90%
have made it, by the way.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
For sure, absolutely, we're
going to go all the way.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is not
going to wipe out.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And there was a lot of life.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.655 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:59.655 --> 00:10:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.461 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty excited
when I found out too.

00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.195 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I
found out-- I mean,

00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of life around
the universe that really didn't

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.550 align:middle line:90%
think we were going to make it.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, they just
said, there's no way.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:90%
We can't possibly do this.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.340 align:middle line:90%
But we did.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.557 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big surprise
for a lot of people.

00:10:21.557 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And there were all
these other people.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.810 align:middle line:90%
They will make it.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.141 align:middle line:90%
They're going to make it.

00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And-- but because we
were affecting everyone.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
What happens here is going to
affect all life everywhere,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:90%
without any exception.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:90%
It's going to affect everyone.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And now the universe
knows it's worked,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and everything-- people
have relaxed everywhere,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
because it was kind of scary
for a while for some people.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
When I say people, I meaning ET
people that are still people.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.584 align:middle line:90%
They just look different.

00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:56.904 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:10:56.904 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So now what we have
permission to do

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
is to completely rewrite
this back to the way

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:90%
that it was originally given.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can do this now,
because we have changed.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We are not who we were
25 years ago or so.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.869 align:middle line:84%
We have really, really,
really, changed.

00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
the things I'm going

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about in
this workshop today,

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago if you
even brought it up,

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.186 align:middle line:84%
they'd just throw you in a
garbage can or something.

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't ever believe you
or think it was even possible.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we are a different--
we have already made changes

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:90%
within us that are huge.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And because of this, we can
begin in the original way,

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:90%
and we start with the heart.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And we actually move up
the chakra instead of down.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, it will be
a lot easier, a lot simpler

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
than the route
that you guys took.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:90%
The Merkaba's complicated.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Sacred geometry is complicated.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't even
have to know that stuff.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.834 align:middle line:84%
Here we're going to
begin with a heart,

00:12:07.834 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
we're going to learn
about sexual energy

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship of
it, move up the throat,

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:84%
through to the tongue, and from
there up to the thalamus gland.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole thing-- and
we're going to still do it,

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to do
this in a different order.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is when you
do it in this other order--

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:84%
at least this is what has
always happened before.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
We won't know for
sure if this is

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.017 align:middle line:84%
going to happen till
we see it happen.

00:12:34.017 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But what has always
happened before is

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:84%
when you do it in
this other way,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.612 align:middle line:84%
the Merkaba happens
automatically.

00:12:39.612 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't even have to do it.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:90%
It just-- choo!

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Goes out.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It's still just as powerful.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.840 align:middle line:84%
You can still program it
and work like any other way,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
but you don't even need to
know it has tetrahedrons.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to know anything.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Which is pretty much how most
people throughout the universe

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:90%
learned this.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:84%
They learned it by experience
and then later studied it

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and understood what
it was internally.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But they picked
it up right away.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is happening all
over the world right now.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.710 align:middle line:84%
There's people that
don't know-- even

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:84%
know what the word Merkaba is,
and they're just sitting there.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But because of the changes
that are happening within us,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:84%
they're just-- it's
just happening to them.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.766 align:middle line:84%
They're just sitting in a
bathtub or something, then--

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:25.266 align:middle line:90%
[TICK]

00:13:25.266 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And they can feel this thing
rotating around them, you know?

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:90%
And they're figuring it out.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.174 align:middle line:84%
That began right before the
turn of the last century

00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:84%
was when we started noticing
that happen around the world.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:90%
It's going a lot faster now.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.859 align:middle line:84%
There are millions
and millions--

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
there's probably over at
least 100 million people

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:90%
in their Merkabas now.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's really out there.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's moving
faster at this moment.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.975 align:middle line:84%
This is a great
time to be alive.

00:13:57.975 --> 00:13:59.391 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:13:59.391 --> 00:14:00.135 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:14:00.135 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:90%
It's just exciting.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I can hardly stand it.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with the
sun right now is awesome.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:90%
And the magnetic fields.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the science
things, and it's negative.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
They think that this is
scary and it potentially

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:90%
could shut the planet down.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally close it down.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to talk about
this in depth at one point,

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
probably on the third day.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Because there's something
going on that if you understand

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
it and you understand what it
is and you know how to-- and you

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:84%
know your energy fields,
you can take this energy

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.065 align:middle line:84%
and make it really positive
instead of negative.

00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:39.619 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
happening right now,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
it's making people all
over the world sick.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
There's lots and lots
of people getting sick,

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.747 align:middle line:84%
and there's about 35 different
types of sickness and illness

00:14:48.747 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:90%
that's coming out from it.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's all being caused
by the magnetic field

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and the stress that's in the
magnetic field right now.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.920 align:middle line:90%
But we'll get into all this.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, beginning
in July, there'll

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
be a new training for anyone
who wishes to teach this work.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
If you want to and if you
think you can, you can.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
However, we're only going to
give two of these trainings.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
do this all the time.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe there might be
another one in the future.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's one in--
there's one in July,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's one in
January of 2012.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's mostly for the
Flower of Life facilitators

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that exist out there
right now so they

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
can be retrained in
this new way, which

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
includes everything,
not just the Merkaba

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:90%
but the whole thing.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.897 align:middle line:84%
What you're going to receive,
but in a different order.

00:15:40.897 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to let
you know that so you

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.855 align:middle line:90%
understood that this is it.

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:90%
This is the last one.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:46.906 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And to talk about this one
now, the Earth/Sky/Heart,

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
the way it's evolved, it
has changed quite a bit

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
over the years, and
especially the last day we

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:84%
have something
different in there

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:84%
completely, because there's
another level of consciousness

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have to-- we have
to not just understand it.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have to be it.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:90%
We have to know it.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to learn.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
In order to get into the
other levels and stay stable

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and in order to
continue on, which

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
is what we're going
to have to do,

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
you have to know
that you are creating

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:84%
every single thing
in the universe

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:90%
with every breath you're taking.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
This is hard to
understand right now,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.410 align:middle line:84%
but you have to know what
the creation process is,

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and you have to know exactly
how it works, precisely.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:90%
And there's two different ones.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.465 align:middle line:84%
There's one that you can
do from your brain and one

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
from your heart.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand
the one from the brain,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
but don't use it, because you'll
understand when we get there.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another way
to create from the heart.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand that
way of creating from the heart,

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.240 align:middle line:84%
you can change your lives
in any way you want.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
The heart will
make this creation,

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:84%
make the change without doing
any harm to anyone, anywhere,

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:90%
on any level of existence.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can have anything
you want, and it's OK.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
You can have all
the money you want,

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
you can have all the-- whatever
it is that you feel you need.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not a problem.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
reason you're doing it.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle line:84%
You're doing it just
so that you have

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:90%
to choose things to understand.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Like with Jesus, he had
to turn water into wine.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
He had to do that, and he had
to do it publicly so that-- he

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:90%
couldn't just hide it.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:84%
He had to show that
he was doing it.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Eventually you'll have
to do it publicly too.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.405 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to see
that it is real.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:90%
But it's dangerous.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
There's danger
associated with this

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
too because the ego is still
involved in this process

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
as you're beginning
to understand.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And so when you-- when you
enter into the creation process

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:84%
while your ego is still there,
there's always this concern

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that your ego will see yourself
doing something that's kind

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:90%
of outrageous and they go, wow.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Look how great I am.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I'm a pretty
important person.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And then start going
out and publicly

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.459 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating to make
money and fame and all

00:18:32.459 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:90%
this other kind of stuff.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:90%
You just lost the game.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just over.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
You've got to wait till
your next lifetime,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:84%
because you just crashed
and burned, basically.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:84%
You have to be very
careful entering into this.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
you have no choice.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:90%
You have to go through it.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus have spent so
much time discussing this.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
These are the sitas, the powers
of what are human potential.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:84%
But still, it is dangerous
only because of the ego.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
It is also dangerous if
it's done through the brain,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
because the brain is a
polarized instrument,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's male on one side
and female and the other.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever you create,
whatever your intention is

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that you create
through the brain,

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:90%
you will get what you ask for.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But you will also,
from the direction

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that you can't see back
here, will come something

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:90%
that you really don't want.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It'll be exactly the opposite
of what your intention was.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And the people that are
working with The Secret,

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.780 align:middle line:84%
they're figuring that one
out probably about now.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.647 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:42.647 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:84%
They're all in court with
each other and fighting.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
They made $600 million on that
DVD, and it's all being frozen.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
They're all fighting
with each other.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And the things are coming back
to them from the other way,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
like with James Ray,
what happened with him.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but there is a way
to go into this process, which

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
we'll show you over
the next five days,

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have to have any
fear at all of worry or concern

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.872 align:middle line:84%
or anything because of where
it's being generated from,

00:20:13.872 --> 00:20:15.610 align:middle line:90%
from within the heart.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is
really intelligent.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And it has this
deep, deep wisdom,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and knows exactly
how to give you

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
what you want without
polarizing it,

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
because it's not-- the
heart is not polarized,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:90%
and without doing harm.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.490 align:middle line:84%
The brain doesn't
care if it does harm.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.786 align:middle line:90%
The ego just doesn't.

00:20:33.786 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't care.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.649 align:middle line:90%
Usually it doesn't care.

00:20:36.649 --> 00:20:38.815 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody's brain does,
but most of them don't.

00:20:38.815 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.606 align:middle line:84%
Now this workshop
here, since we're

00:20:45.606 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
talking about two
different ones,

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:84%
this one, Earth/Sky/Heart, is
divided-- is five days long.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to talk
about the different days.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:84%
They're really utterly
different each day.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
This day I call the
day of the opening.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And really, most of what's
going on during this time

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.580 align:middle line:90%
is not physical.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with all
of our higher selves

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
are right now having
a party somewhere.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
laughing and talking

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and exchanging energy
in different ways,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.064 align:middle line:90%
and doing things.

00:21:24.064 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
excited, I'm sure,

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
because they know that
you're here physically,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:90%
and we're all going to get this.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the party is
what's really important.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.570 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the connection that
we are making right now.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
This connection started
a long time ago.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:84%
At the moment you
decided to come here,

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:90%
we connected in the dream world.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Probably a lot of you
may remember this.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may not but
probably, a very large number

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:90%
do remember.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And we used the ancient
Egyptian temple of dreams

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and what they've learned
in that as a school

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:90%
to begin the process.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But once we actually
get here in this day,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:84%
this is when this thing happens
on another level of existence

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.390 align:middle line:90%
that is really important.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So what happens on
this day, we could just

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
sit around and hang out under
trees or something, you know?

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
It is the essence of what's
happening is this thing.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to use the time.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But that's the most important
thing that's going on.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.820 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Then tomorrow we're
going to switch from that

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to the body itself, and it'll be
a day of healing and primarily

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:84%
working on the chakra
system, and specifically

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:90%
on the two heart chakras.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
You have one heart chakra
here and another one here.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And this one's connected
directly to the heart,

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and the upper one's
connected to the right brain.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we have two
emotional bodies.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
We have one here, which is the
one where you function from,

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:84%
which is polarized, which
has love and hate, et cetera,

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.030 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this
other emotional body,

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:84%
which most of us have
never experienced,

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
which is the same range
of positive emotions,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.829 align:middle line:84%
but it has no
negative ones at all.

00:23:20.829 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the only place
that unconditional love

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:90%
can actually really exist.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing
as unconditional love

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:90%
from the brain.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we usually
are attracted to our mates.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
We see them because we like
the way they look or whatever,

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.390 align:middle line:84%
or their money or
something, whatever

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:90%
it is about them that we like.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we say we
love each other.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:90%
But that love is conditional.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
All that person
has to do is just

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:84%
say the wrong things at the
wrong time, and it's over.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.274 align:middle line:90%
But not true with the heart.

00:23:52.274 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If you actually fell in love
with someone from your heart,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't matter.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't make any difference
what you were doing.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
You would never stop
loving that person.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Ever.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And so this is another
part of all of this.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to focus on
these two heart chakras,

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
most of our trauma is.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.060 align:middle line:84%
We also have deep trauma
in our sexual chakra,

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.010 align:middle line:90%
but it's usually related.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.760 align:middle line:84%
There's usually a
relationship between it.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:84%
If you get this, you'll get a
lot of the sexual trauma also.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is stopping
a lot of people

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:84%
from being able to
spiritually evolve.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:84%
There are other things
that are stopping us.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:84%
There's other levels
in our emotional body.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:84%
That's not the only thing,
but this is the biggest one.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can
just skip that one,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that your
meditation is easier, clearer,

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:90%
and you can expand farther.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do anything
about this, then

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
what happens as you go up,
you hit a certain level

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.084 align:middle line:84%
of meditation, and then
you can go for 30 years

00:25:01.084 --> 00:25:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and you don't go
one inch further,

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
because those traumas stop you
from proceeding any further.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
that we do this.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of fun, the
way it's been laid out.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:84%
This was archangel
Michael who created this.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.710 align:middle line:90%
It was not me.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe tomorrow when we get
into it, I'll talk about it.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, we're going
to go into day three, which

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.260 align:middle line:90%
is the day of the mind.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Again, total shift to
something completely different.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to-- a
lot of concepts and ideas

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
of everything that we're
going to try to straighten out

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.770 align:middle line:84%
so that you can understand
what is going on

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.875 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening on a
lot of different levels.

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It helps your mental way of
perceiving what's going on.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And that also can--
ideas can also stop you.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Look what religions do.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of things, because
if you have the wrong concept,

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:90%
it can-- it can stop you also.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And then on the fourth day, we
go into the day of the heart.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is the-- I can usually
hardly wait for that day.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.941 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.298 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:26:19.298 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a totally soft,
a different kind of day,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
distinctly different than the
day before, which is the mind.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
into the heart.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And that'll be all day long.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And then on the fifth
day, the last day,

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go into what's
called tantra of the heart.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Because sexual energy
is important in life.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just pleasure.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot more
associated with it.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Sexual energy can create
a human being, a baby.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:84%
But it can also create
anything in existence.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Planets, galaxies, anything.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:90%
It takes three people to do it.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it by
yourself when you

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:90%
start creating on these levels.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.796 align:middle line:84%
But it takes three
people to create a baby.

00:27:19.796 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
It takes one mommy,
a daddy, and a baby.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And one is male, one
is female, and the baby

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:90%
can be male or female.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So it takes two
males and a female

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
or two females and a
male to create anything

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:90%
on these higher levels.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:90%
That's minimum.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:90%
You can have a lot more.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's
hundreds or thousands

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.040 align:middle line:84%
more that are working
together to do things.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.347 align:middle line:90%
But that's the minimum number.

00:27:44.347 --> 00:27:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to go into-- that's

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.888 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to get
deep into the creation

00:27:47.888 --> 00:27:50.425 align:middle line:90%
process of how everything works.

00:27:50.425 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And so this is a school.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
This is-- and we might
laugh and have fun and play,

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of other things.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
still keep focusing

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.490 align:middle line:84%
on trying to give you the
knowledge and understanding

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and direct experience
so that you can proceed

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:90%
in your way of evolving.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:90%
And we're all different.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I think that's about it.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly-- there's--
by the way, there are certain--

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.230 align:middle line:84%
though I have it all written
down where we're going to go

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:84%
kind of, there's a lot of
little branches that go off.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on who you
are and what you need.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:84%
This one may not be exactly the
same as another one that we do,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:84%
because it depends on what
the needs are of the group.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is, that's
what we're going to do.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we are going to be a big
family before this is all over.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to imagine, because
we're from all over the world.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But we all really have the same
core, same purpose, reason,

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:90%
same desires in life.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.195 align:middle line:84%
We're human beings,
and we have one mother.

00:29:09.195 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:90%
That's Mother Earth.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:17.962 align:middle line:84%
And we have one divine father,
which is the sun itself.

00:29:17.962 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have one-- there's
only a great spirit--

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
there is just one spirit
that moves through all life

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.970 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:28.664 align:middle line:84%
So even weird looking ET is
really your brother or sister.

00:29:28.664 --> 00:29:29.955 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're all interrelated.

00:29:29.955 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And life right now really
does love us and care.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I have to add a little thing.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:45.065 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, I apologize for
what the graze of the reptiles

00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:90%
have done.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Because when that was our first
introduction to other life,

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and those guys were just here
to kill us and get rid of us.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:90%
They had good reason to.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:84%
If you know and if you
understand what was going on

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and why, we destroyed over
100 of the great planets.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Whole planets.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Killed everybody on it.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they were
here, because otherwise,

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:84%
they would have never came here,
and they came here to find out

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:84%
what we were doing, and
then to try to correct it,

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:90%
which they couldn't.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
wanted to eliminate us.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:90%
That's over.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, with the graze side it is.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite over
with the reptiles yet.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's almost over.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And it will be over
with very, very soon.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's behind that is
the rest of the universe.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment
right now, there

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is a-- somewhere between 250,000
to maybe as many as 300,000

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:84%
different cultures, different
races of species that

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:90%
are here on Earth right now.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And they are here
out of pure love.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:90%
They're extremely high beings.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.700 align:middle line:90%
They understand the situation.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:84%
They came here to
raise our consciousness

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.892 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't going
to make it on her own.

00:31:08.892 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And their time-- their
time is about to go.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:90%
You're going to see the love.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:90%
You're going to feel it.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's almost here.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to see this just
over the next two, three years

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.640 align:middle line:90%
or less.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:84%
You're going to realize
how much life is here,

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.579 align:middle line:84%
and how much they care about
us and how powerful they are.

00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:90%
They're incredible.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.170 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I was
apologizing about the graze

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
of the reptiles,
because-- and there's

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.190 align:middle line:84%
a few other little races that
are with them-- because they

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.410 align:middle line:84%
had an agenda, and they were
trying to fulfill that agenda.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But that's going to
end and it's going

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:84%
to be replaced with
something that's

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:84%
going to make you feel
a lot better about life.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:03.497 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:32:03.497 --> 00:32:04.990 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you a
little bit about myself,

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.586 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to ask
me the questions anyway.

00:32:09.586 --> 00:32:11.560 align:middle line:90%
So I [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm married.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:90%
My wife is Claudette.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.500 align:middle line:90%
I have five kids.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.460 align:middle line:90%
I've been very busy.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.364 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.364 --> 00:32:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Three of them from
another family.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
They're ranging
from about 35 to 39.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm starting all
over with an 18-year-old

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and a 20-year-old girl.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Marley and Mia,
and they live here.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And what other question
did you ask me?

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.700 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Where am I from?

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Where I am originally from?

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.595 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:53.095 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:53.095 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm definitely an ET.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.420 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm not from here at all.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.975 align:middle line:84%
But where I'm from
is where we're going.

00:33:02.975 --> 00:33:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
reason why I'm here

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:84%
is to-- I had a frequency
of where I was from,

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and then the ascended
masters took that from me

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and figured out how
to get back there.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:84%
They made three
or four attempts.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And then finally in about the
mid '90s, they were convinced

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.860 align:middle line:90%
and they all left.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.010 align:middle line:84%
All of them except
for seven of them.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And now about 4,000
of them are still--

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:84%
4,000 people from humanity
are now in the new world

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.800 align:middle line:84%
where-- new universe
that we're going to.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And then about 4,000
came back here.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And they have that
knowledge of how to do this.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why I know
we're going to make it.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:46.700 align:middle line:90%
We've made it, really.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.619 align:middle line:84%
Part of humanity
is already there.

00:33:49.619 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:84%
They're no different--
ascended masters are

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:90%
no different than you or me.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.110 align:middle line:84%
They just-- they're a
little bit further along.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.140 align:middle line:90%
A little bit.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Not much, but enough to--
it looks like a lot maybe,

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:90%
but it isn't really.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.700 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
there very, very soon.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:10.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:17.139 align:middle line:84%
And then coming in, I spent
about 15 years on Pleiades

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:90%
on a particular planet there.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like going down in
water or climbing a mountain.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.730 align:middle line:84%
You can't just go to the
top or go to the bottom.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go down in stages
and you have to learn things.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.239 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what--
the Pleiades is

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.449 align:middle line:90%
like a university or a school.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
learning about Earth.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to so Sirius
for about a year-- I'm

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.179 align:middle line:84%
talking about Earth year
times-- about a year there,

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:47.360 align:middle line:84%
which they gave me very
definite training on that.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.969 align:middle line:84%
And then I flew here in a
big ship, a really big one.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:54.492 align:middle line:84%
It took 400 people
just to fly it.

00:34:54.492 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I came here, came to Venus
first because that's their--

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:84%
it's the headquarters
of the solar system,

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.180 align:middle line:90%
and you have to get permission.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.060 align:middle line:84%
We were already going
through the stages.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.570 align:middle line:90%
And then I came here.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:90%
I came here in 1840.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But immediately, went in to the
fourth dimension on the Earth,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.020 align:middle line:90%
looking for somebody.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And there was nobody there.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Nobody that had any
consciousness hardly.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.789 align:middle line:84%
And then went up
and found them all.

00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:24.955 align:middle line:84%
All the ascended masters
were in the sixth dimension

00:35:24.955 --> 00:35:28.560 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth's awareness.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.616 align:middle line:84%
I spent about 10 years
trying to understand.

00:35:31.616 --> 00:35:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Then I felt like I knew it.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I came down, and I was born my
first lifetime here in 1850.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:90%
And then died in 1890.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.240 align:middle line:90%
But I made so many mistakes.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I just-- I did
everything wrong possible.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was so sure
that I had it down.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.321 align:middle line:84%
And so then I went
back there and I said,

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:84%
God, you guys didn't tell
me all this stuff, you know.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.510 align:middle line:90%
It hurts to be down there.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:90%
So I stayed a long time.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:07.090 align:middle line:90%
And the time as different.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.930 align:middle line:84%
As you go up in dimensions,
time gets longer, bigger.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:12.590 align:middle line:90%
You have more of it.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.292 align:middle line:84%
And so I was there
from 1890 to 1972.

00:36:15.292 --> 00:36:17.000 align:middle line:90%
That was 82 years.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.810 align:middle line:84%
That's a long, long,
long, long time.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:19.560 align:middle line:90%
And I figured, OK.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Now I've got it.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't--
wasn't born normally.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I walked into this body on
just a couple days-- April 10

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.160 align:middle line:84%
of 1972, and been
here ever since.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Is that your birthday?

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>That's the birth-- yeah.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, I consider--
that's my birthday,

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.989 align:middle line:90%
because that's when I came in.

00:36:36.989 --> 00:36:38.295 align:middle line:90%
But the body was older.

00:36:38.295 --> 00:36:41.580 align:middle line:84%
The body's 70 years
old, but I'm only 39.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.548 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:45.548 --> 00:36:49.516 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:54.430 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But I can only say
that for one more year.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:00.108 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:00.108 --> 00:37:02.427 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.427 --> 00:37:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>You remember this?

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yeah.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.919 align:middle line:90%
He asked if I remember this.

00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:06.835 align:middle line:90%
I remember everything.

00:37:06.835 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:14.580 align:middle line:84%
We have within our heart
a special little place

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.410 align:middle line:90%
that records everything.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything we've ever
said, ever done, ever felt.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Scratching our head, anything.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It's total Akashic
records, first of all.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And so it's all there.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:90%
And you will remember.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.564 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the name of
this school that we're

00:37:35.564 --> 00:37:36.980 align:middle line:84%
going to reverse
this whole thing,

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:84%
it's called the
school of remembering.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't need
to learn anything.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:43.700 align:middle line:90%
You're all masters.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You all know this
stuff inside and out.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%
You just had a bump on your
head and are just a little--

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.240 align:middle line:90%
forgot a little bit.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And all you have
to do is remember.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.217 align:middle line:84%
When you connect back
into your heart properly,

00:37:55.217 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:90%
all your members will come back.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:90%
You'll remember everything.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.570 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't just your memories.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It's the entire universe.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the Akashic
records of everything.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Not just the past, but
the past, the present,

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:90%
and eternal future.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:90%
All-- everything.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all recorded.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.380 align:middle line:90%
It's already happened.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.235 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of weird for us
to try to understand this now,

00:38:20.235 --> 00:38:22.680 align:middle line:84%
but what we're doing
has already occurred.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:84%
This is why in
"The Torah" there's

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:84%
a code inside "The Torah" that
they called the "Bible" code,

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.590 align:middle line:84%
but it was really
just "The Torah" code.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And in there, every word
that I'm saying right now

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:35.944 align:middle line:90%
is written down.

00:38:35.944 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:90%
It's already happened.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.700 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>How'd you get your name?

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>My name?

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:90%
They gave it to me.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have-- I
was Melchizedek.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But they gave me this name
specifically for Earth,

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Drunvalo Melchizedek.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.194 align:middle line:90%


00:38:55.194 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they
gave me that name.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.484 align:middle line:90%
They just did.

00:38:57.484 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:90%
They said, here's your name.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.085 align:middle line:90%
And I go, thank you very much.

00:39:00.085 --> 00:39:01.119 align:middle line:90%
And what is it now?

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Say it again.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a Druid name.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the whole name,
Drunvalo and Melchizedek

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.590 align:middle line:90%
is an English Druid name.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Druids see
Melchizedek as living

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.745 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the Earth.

00:39:15.745 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:90%
And so they look down.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:90%
That understanding is so wise.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in terms of how--
where life is and how it works.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.700 align:middle line:84%
If we have time-- I
don't know if we will

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
or not-- that's part
of what's called

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.990 align:middle line:90%
the advanced workshop of this.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But the center of the Earth
is exactly identical to what's

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.820 align:middle line:90%
outside the Earth.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
The entire stars,
planets, everything

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.410 align:middle line:84%
in the same exact arrangement,
same precise everything

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:84%
exists in the very, very center
of the Earth in a spot so small

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't see it
if it was here right now.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.675 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it's all about.

00:40:00.675 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:84%
The Fibonacci seq-- I mean,
the golden mean rectangle

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.836 align:middle line:84%
rotates in-- or
the spiral, if you

00:40:06.836 --> 00:40:08.870 align:middle line:84%
want to look at it that
way-- rotates in forever

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.203 align:middle line:84%
and ever and ever, going in,
getting smaller and smaller

00:40:11.203 --> 00:40:12.440 align:middle line:90%
and smaller forever.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.924 align:middle line:90%
That's what's in the Earth.

00:40:13.924 --> 00:40:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But from this place where
we are right now, whatever

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.514 align:middle line:84%
size you start at,
it'll also rotate

00:40:18.514 --> 00:40:20.930 align:middle line:84%
out forever and ever and ever
and expand forever and ever.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you see out there.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:25.970 align:middle line:90%
And they are the same.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Nassim Haramein is actually
proving this right now.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:90%
He's a physicist.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.950 align:middle line:90%
PhD, I believe.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.260 align:middle line:90%
He's not PhD?

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.420 align:middle line:90%
What is he?

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Just self-taught.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Self-taught.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>Self-taught?

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.137 align:middle line:84%
>>He's not-- he
doesn't have a degree?

00:40:45.137 --> 00:40:45.636 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:40:45.636 --> 00:40:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>I didn't know that.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE] for 30 years
to think outside the box.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:57.210 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting to know that,
because he was putting himself

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:84%
off like he was-- so that's why
he calls himself a scientist.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:02.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.140 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to do now is
I have to check your Merkabas.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Now everybody here is supposed
to have been practicing this

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.090 align:middle line:84%
for at least six weeks
before you got here,

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:14.150 align:middle line:90%
so you can understand.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But still, what I've
discovered all over

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.150 align:middle line:84%
the world is that
people make mistakes.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:22.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
something and they

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:25.610 align:middle line:84%
start doing a practice in
there, and that practice is not

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:90%
going to benefit them at all.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
correct these things.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are talked
about in the books.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.100 align:middle line:84%
But people just sort
of glance over that.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.974 align:middle line:84%
They just keep right on
going, and they never

00:41:38.974 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:90%
really notice it.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there's things I have to
find out, if you have mistakes.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:84%
One of these things
is probably--

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to start
with the most important one.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Because this one is
essential because if you

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.900 align:middle line:84%
are doing it wrong, you will
eventually start getting sick,

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.635 align:middle line:90%
and eventually you'll die.

00:42:05.635 --> 00:42:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's
pretty important.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.258 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:10.258 --> 00:42:10.999 align:middle line:90%


00:42:10.999 --> 00:42:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
out there actually

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.564 align:middle line:84%
teaching this, which is--
really blows my mind,

00:42:14.564 --> 00:42:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing I can
do or you can do about it.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.431 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
casualties in this.

00:42:21.431 --> 00:42:22.805 align:middle line:84%
But you can't
reverse your field.

00:42:22.805 --> 00:42:25.500 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.060 align:middle line:84%
If you reverse your field,
it's an anti-life force,

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.410 align:middle line:90%
and it'll actually kill you.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows
this everywhere.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.960 align:middle line:84%
You can just look
at the planets.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.460 align:middle line:84%
If you look from north
pole of all the planets,

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.340 align:middle line:84%
they're all rotating--
and the sun,

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.756 align:middle line:84%
they're rotating
counterclockwise.

00:42:40.756 --> 00:42:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:84%
When a planet starts to rotate
the other way, everything on it

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.230 align:middle line:90%
will die.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Even if it has an atmosphere
and water and everything else,

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.140 align:middle line:90%
it would die.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:90%
The planet's time is different.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:90%
It would take a while.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It might take a thousand years,
but it would eventually happen.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:04.590 align:middle line:84%
If you go into nature
anywhere, you'll see vortexes.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Sedona's not the only
place that has vortexes.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:07.760 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.205 align:middle line:84%
Though there are places where
you go where there are just,

00:43:10.205 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:90%
like, none.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are areas.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.000 align:middle line:84%
They're just-- you
won't find very many.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.975 align:middle line:84%
But this place is
loaded with them.

00:43:16.975 --> 00:43:18.646 align:middle line:84%
There are about--
little tiny ones

00:43:18.646 --> 00:43:19.770 align:middle line:90%
are about every three feet.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:20.590 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.340 align:middle line:84%
If you put a pendulum
out, especially when

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:84%
you get into the red
rocks, you'll see this.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.297 align:middle line:90%


00:43:27.297 --> 00:43:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you go into
where there's trees

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.838 align:middle line:84%
and you can-- not just
rocks, but where there's

00:43:30.838 --> 00:43:33.710 align:middle line:84%
trees and plants and things
like that, you'll see these--

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.390 align:middle line:84%
they're perfect
circles, usually.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:37.450 align:middle line:84%
They're absolutely
flawless most of the time.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:90%
They're perfectly round circles.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:43.266 align:middle line:84%
And everything-- and
they're the thickness

00:43:43.266 --> 00:43:47.060 align:middle line:84%
of even thinner than a
sheet of paper of where

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:90%
you're in it and not in it.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Like there's one--
how many people

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:84%
have been to--
what's that called?

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.730 align:middle line:90%
The Mystery Spot in California.

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:59.220 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.230 align:middle line:84%
In these vortexes, they make
all kinds of distortions.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You have one there, I
think at the Mystery Spot,

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:05.604 align:middle line:84%
where you have a
thing like this.

00:44:05.604 --> 00:44:08.590 align:middle line:84%
You put the ball at the
bottom, and it rolls up.

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.360 align:middle line:84%
There's another one where they
have a piece of concrete that's

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:84%
halfway in the vortex and
halfway out of the vortex.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.375 align:middle line:90%
And it's perfectly level.

00:44:18.375 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can bring
your own level.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a level on it, but
you can bring your own level

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:21.980 align:middle line:90%
and see.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.987 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly level.

00:44:22.987 --> 00:44:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can have two people
exactly the same size,

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:28.240 align:middle line:84%
one standing on this
thing, the same thing,

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.630 align:middle line:90%
one standing inside.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're about--
the person inside

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:35.670 align:middle line:84%
is about four or
five inches shorter.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.129 align:middle line:84%
And you change
places and look back

00:44:37.129 --> 00:44:39.503 align:middle line:84%
the other way, and all of the
sudden, you're really short

00:44:39.503 --> 00:44:40.620 align:middle line:90%
and they're really tall.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain it
in any way you want,

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.550 align:middle line:84%
but there's
distortions that take

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.720 align:middle line:90%
place inside of these things.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you'll also find
is that especially here, you

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.020 align:middle line:84%
can see them here where
there's trees and everything,

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.960 align:middle line:84%
that if a tree is
inside there, the tree

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:03.030 align:middle line:84%
trunk is going to rotate in
the direction of the vortex.

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll see tree trunks
that are just twisted around

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:07.770 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:15.480 align:middle line:84%
If they happen to be
in a anti-clockwise

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.480 align:middle line:84%
or a counterclockwise vortex
as you're looking down

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.267 align:middle line:84%
at it from the north, they
will be stronger and better

00:45:23.267 --> 00:45:23.850 align:middle line:90%
and healthier.

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're all twisted
up, they'll be doing great.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:30.090 align:middle line:84%
If you go to one where
you see a tree that

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:34.200 align:middle line:84%
is rotating the other way,
the tree is usually dead.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.610 align:middle line:84%
It means that the
vortex happened

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.000 align:middle line:90%
after it started growing.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.324 align:middle line:84%
And everything-- and then you
won't see any little bushes

00:45:41.324 --> 00:45:42.490 align:middle line:90%
or anything in there at all.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:43.823 align:middle line:90%
They'll be long gone after that.

00:45:43.823 --> 00:45:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It'll just be totally vacant.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you see a positive
one, it goes up in the air,

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:56.852 align:middle line:84%
comes back down, and it reverses
the field by doing that.

00:45:56.852 --> 00:45:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so wherever
there's a positive one,

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.050 align:middle line:90%
there's always a negative on.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:02.300 align:middle line:90%
They always link together.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:07.410 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're the same way.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And so if you rotate your
field this way, you're fine.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you switch those
fields and go that way,

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:84%
you've just created an anti-life
forcefield around your body,

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to get weak
and eventually get sick.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you
won't be able to survive.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I've got to see
if anybody's doing this.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:28.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:29.250 align:middle line:90%


00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.840 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.420 align:middle line:84%
From a point in front of you,
are you rotating the male one

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.836 align:middle line:90%
to your left 34?

00:46:38.836 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Is there anybody not doing that?

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.696 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:46:43.696 --> 00:46:45.004 align:middle line:90%
From a point in front.

00:46:45.004 --> 00:46:46.420 align:middle line:84%
If you pick the
point-- once I had

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:90%
a person who was really sick.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.800 align:middle line:84%
They got-- ended
up in a wheelchair.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And this was only about
three or four years

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.540 align:middle line:84%
into doing the Merkaba,
and they were just getting

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.750 align:middle line:90%
sicker and sicker and sicker.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And when she described it
to me, she was saying, no.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing exactly
what you're saying.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't
understand it,

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.780 align:middle line:84%
because it just-- the
symptoms were so clear to me.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.320 align:middle line:90%
But she was saying, no, no.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going 34 to the left
and 34 to the right.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And then after a long
discussion with her,

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I found out she didn't
pick a point in front.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.110 align:middle line:90%
She picked a point in the back.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:20.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:26.140 align:middle line:84%
But she was going 34
this way, 21 this way,

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.140 align:middle line:90%
and it reversed the field.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.430 align:middle line:84%
As soon as she switched
it back the other way

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and chose a point
in front of her so

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.095 align:middle line:84%
the reference was correct,
all of her symptoms went away

00:47:35.095 --> 00:47:37.810 align:middle line:90%
and she's fine.

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And so nobody's doing
that here, I don't think.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:41.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:46.420 align:middle line:90%
We need the mic.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.660 align:middle line:84%
This is Natalia here
who's bringing, just

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.477 align:middle line:90%
to introduce you.

00:47:50.477 --> 00:47:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>I changed my name.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, you did?

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.379 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:47:52.379 --> 00:47:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Olivia.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Olivia?

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:55.820 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.361 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi, Olivia.

00:47:56.361 --> 00:47:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>I didn't know that.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.885 align:middle line:84%
>>In the book, in
the explanation,

00:48:02.885 --> 00:48:05.780 align:middle line:84%
in the whole rotation with one
going one way and one going

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.060 align:middle line:84%
the other way, I found
that in meditating,

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:14.200 align:middle line:84%
it was so complex that my
brain just-- it curled.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It just started-- so I
just gave the intent for it

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:90%
to do what it does.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't tell you
which way it's going,

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.350 align:middle line:90%
because I haven't tried to--

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:27.737 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, actually
that works perfect.

00:48:27.737 --> 00:48:29.174 align:middle line:90%
>>Why?

00:48:29.174 --> 00:48:30.611 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.000 align:middle line:84%
There's two ways of
creating the Merkaba.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.380 align:middle line:90%
One is male and one is female.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And the male way has to
know every little detail,

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and has to stay
within the boundaries

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.950 align:middle line:90%
of the logical patterns.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But the female
doesn't work on logic.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.290 align:middle line:84%
She works in another way,
which is mostly intention,

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.420 align:middle line:90%
like you were just saying.

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.940 align:middle line:90%
And you can do that.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But I was-- my instructions were
to teach the male way, to get

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.560 align:middle line:90%
the males to come to this.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.157 align:middle line:84%
Now with this new way
that we're about to do it,

00:49:03.157 --> 00:49:04.490 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what will happen.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.190 align:middle line:84%
When you get to
the final patterns

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.815 align:middle line:84%
and you get all these
things linked up,

00:49:07.815 --> 00:49:09.860 align:middle line:84%
you just tell it to do
it, and you don't even

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.230 align:middle line:84%
have to know what's spinning
around you or what or how,

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:15.730 align:middle line:90%
and it'll do it perfectly.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's mostly women
throughout the world

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.560 align:middle line:90%
that are doing it in this way.

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.940 align:middle line:84%
The men can do it
just as well, but men

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.050 align:middle line:84%
tend to want to go
to the logical way.

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:90%
And so you're fine.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:30.300 align:middle line:90%


00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000 align:middle line:90%
The next one.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.086 align:middle line:90%


00:49:36.086 --> 00:49:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Is there anybody here that is
doing the Merkaba where you

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.170 align:middle line:90%
have a-- I'll try to lock this.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Don't, no, no!

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.295 align:middle line:90%
I want to move!

00:49:56.295 --> 00:49:57.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.262 align:middle line:84%
Where this point-- this
is the male point forward

00:50:00.262 --> 00:50:01.470 align:middle line:90%
and the female point forward.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:02.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll use the male one.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But is there anybody taking
this male or the sun tetrahedron

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and spinning it one
way, and the female one,

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.056 align:middle line:84%
and spinning it
in the other way?

00:50:12.056 --> 00:50:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Is there anyone doing that?

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.550 align:middle line:90%


00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Just so you know, there's
a spectrum of Merkabas

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:19.730 align:middle line:90%
that are possible.

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:23.250 align:middle line:84%
The universe has found a
little more than 100,000.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:29.030 align:middle line:84%
There's about 100,000 and
200,000, approximately.

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they've learned.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.310 align:middle line:84%
They haven't found a new one
in a very, very long time

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:37.120 align:middle line:84%
because they've exhausted
all possibilities.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:42.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you spin the top
one way and the bottom one

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.860 align:middle line:84%
the other way,
that's the first one.

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:47.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the very first,
simplest, easiest way

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to create an energy
field around your body.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And medicine men and
shamans all around the world

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:57.300 align:middle line:84%
have been doing this
for thousands of years.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with it.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's
very, very limited.

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:06.750 align:middle line:84%
You can go fourth dimensional,
but you can't go any higher.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:08.820 align:middle line:90%
And so you can do fancy things.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can disappear.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.080 align:middle line:84%
You can, you know,
all kinds of stuff.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can gain information and
knowledge, and lots of things

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that you can do that shamans
haven't done with it.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's not capable
of making the movement

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:25.630 align:middle line:90%
that we need to make.

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they eliminated that
one and went to the second one.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is the realization

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that there's actually
three sets of these things,

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.720 align:middle line:90%
and they're on the same axis.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're
stationary, which

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:44.640 align:middle line:84%
is where they are
around most people,

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.300 align:middle line:84%
if you could
psychically see them,

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.850 align:middle line:84%
you'd just see one
set sitting there

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.683 align:middle line:84%
when there's actually
three, because they're

00:51:49.683 --> 00:51:51.110 align:middle line:90%
the same size on the same axis.

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's one set that is male
that is electrical in nature,

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's basically
our mind, and it

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:02.950 align:middle line:84%
moves this way, counterclockwise
relative to where I am.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the female one,
which is magnetic in nature,

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and is the emotional body work
and it goes the other way.

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
one that's fixed.

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.137 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't move.

00:52:14.137 --> 00:52:16.470 align:middle line:84%
However, just so you understand,
because a lot of people

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:20.820 align:middle line:84%
don't understand this, the
difference between 34 and 21

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.110 align:middle line:90%
is 13.

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:23.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole thing.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:26.610 align:middle line:84%
If you put it into a computer
and made this computer model

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:27.890 align:middle line:90%
to do it, you'd see it.

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:32.440 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing rotates
around counterclockwise at 13

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.840 align:middle line:84%
while the other things
are doing this thing

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.800 align:middle line:90%
in the middle in there.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.350 align:middle line:90%


00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.905 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is complicated.

00:52:40.905 --> 00:52:43.120 align:middle line:90%
The human body is complicated.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.405 align:middle line:84%
And if you look inside the
muscles and all the nerves

00:52:45.405 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff
that's in here,

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.350 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing what's
going on inside here.

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And our light body is
actually really simple

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:57.090 align:middle line:84%
compared to the other, but
it's still complicated.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So just with your
intention, make

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.890 align:middle line:84%
sure that you understand that
it's a full set going that way,

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:07.150 align:middle line:84%
a full set going that way,
and one set that's fixed.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And it'll be fine.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.740 align:middle line:84%
However, let me
find out if there's

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.120 align:middle line:84%
any other-- because if
you have been doing this

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.450 align:middle line:84%
with just the top one one
and the bottom one other one,

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.330 align:middle line:84%
when you switch, when
you realize the situation

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and you switch to
this system, usually

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.270 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, what
I see a lot of times--

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.900 align:middle line:84%
it may not happen now, but it
usually does-- the person just

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.060 align:middle line:90%
breaks out in a sweat.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just like-- they get
really hot and start sweating.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:37.635 align:middle line:84%
And it lasts about
five minutes, and then

00:53:37.635 --> 00:53:39.600 align:middle line:90%
it never happens again.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just telling you that now
so if you do change this later

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and you do break out in a sweat,
just don't worry about it.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.330 align:middle line:90%
It'll go away.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.250 align:middle line:90%
It'll never happen again.

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:50.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the body.

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:53.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot-- this
is a lot more energy.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.310 align:middle line:84%
There's really many, many,
many times more energy,

00:53:56.310 --> 00:54:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and the body, when it
actually experiences it,

00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:03.290 align:middle line:90%
sometimes has a little reaction.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, one more.

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So when I started doing it,
I did the top and the bottom.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:12.260 align:middle line:90%
And I felt a heat.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.266 align:middle line:84%
And now I understand-- I
understand what happened.

00:54:15.266 --> 00:54:19.450 align:middle line:84%
But then I switch it, but
when I do the intention,

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:24.360 align:middle line:84%
instead of spinning
like this and like that,

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.976 align:middle line:90%
it spins like this.

00:54:25.976 --> 00:54:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Over the top?

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.502 align:middle line:90%
>>And it spins like that.

00:54:27.502 --> 00:54:28.001 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:54:28.001 --> 00:54:30.992 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just--
it just happened.

00:54:30.992 --> 00:54:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>There are a few people in
the world that it happens with.

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:34.830 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very rare.

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:44.270 align:middle line:84%
You're about one in maybe
400,000 or 500,000 people.

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare that instead
of spinning this way,

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.060 align:middle line:84%
it spins over the
top, does that.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.310 align:middle line:84%
If that's what's happening
with you and it's natural--

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.880 align:middle line:84%
you didn't intend it or
force it or anything to do

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.190 align:middle line:90%
it-- don't worry about it.

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:58.796 align:middle line:84%
Stay there and just do it
coming out of the sides

00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:00.170 align:middle line:84%
rather than out
through the axis.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The angels actually had
me learn how to do that.

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But I never understood why they
had me learn how to do that.

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of things we can

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:16.490 align:middle line:84%
do with this that I don't talk
about, and that's one of them.

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you-- I've only met
maybe three or four people.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You're probably about
the fifth one ever.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a-- all
of these other people

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.730 align:middle line:90%
had this particular problem.

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was that if they
stand in a certain direction

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.760 align:middle line:84%
in a certain place, they
stand there for a little bit,

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.950 align:middle line:90%
they begin to dissolve.

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:42.140 align:middle line:90%
They disappear.

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.132 align:middle line:84%
Nothing like this has
ever happened to you?

00:55:44.132 --> 00:55:45.096 align:middle line:90%
>>Not yet.

00:55:45.096 --> 00:55:47.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>But you're waiting.

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:51.258 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:51.258 --> 00:55:53.200 align:middle line:90%


00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.990 align:middle line:84%
We had a yoga
teacher in Seattle,

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and he said he just had to
be really, really careful.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.031 align:middle line:84%
Because if he stood in
a certain direction,

00:56:00.031 --> 00:56:04.307 align:middle line:84%
which was kind of like-- it
was toward the north somewhere.

00:56:04.307 --> 00:56:06.265 align:middle line:84%
And he says, if I stay
there for more than four

00:56:06.265 --> 00:56:08.499 align:middle line:84%
or five minutes, I just
absolutely no poof,

00:56:08.499 --> 00:56:09.040 align:middle line:90%
and I'm gone.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.498 align:middle line:84%
And he's done it in front of
his people, not intentionally,

00:56:11.498 --> 00:56:12.983 align:middle line:90%
and freaked them out.

00:56:12.983 --> 00:56:14.252 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:14.252 --> 00:56:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.755 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
really concerned.

00:56:16.755 --> 00:56:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Am I doing something wrong?

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.630 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen
to me, or anything?

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But my inner guide
is saying, no.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:26.760 align:middle line:84%
There's these really strange
people that have this,

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.180 align:middle line:90%
and it's OK.

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You have a function
in the reality.

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like every person, every
cell in the body-- you've

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:36.270 align:middle line:84%
got red cells, but you've
got these little white cells

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:39.860 align:middle line:84%
that go around and keep
everything clean and stuff.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And so your function
in reality's

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:45.630 align:middle line:84%
a little different
for what you do,

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.810 align:middle line:90%
but you're really important.

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And so on the bigger
level of life.

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And so just go with it
and don't worry about it.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:00.897 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:57:00.897 --> 00:57:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Looks like it.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.272 align:middle line:90%
Oh, one-- one more.

00:57:03.272 --> 00:57:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>So what's the ideal?

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Ideally for most
people, one set of these

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.510 align:middle line:84%
should be going from a
point in front of you

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to your left, 34 times around,
while this one is going around

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.960 align:middle line:90%
21 times around, a female.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.045 align:middle line:90%
And that's a ratio.

00:57:23.045 --> 00:57:25.055 align:middle line:90%
It's a Fibonacci ratio.

00:57:25.055 --> 00:57:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Those are Fibonacci numbers.

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
Fibonacci possibilities.

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's a 34
21, there's 34 55.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.730 align:middle line:84%
You could reverse it
and go the other way.

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:42.324 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
use reverse fields,

00:57:42.324 --> 00:57:43.740 align:middle line:84%
but you have to
know how to do it.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:50.080 align:middle line:84%
A reverse field is putting the
female stronger than the male.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
it's dangerous.

00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.992 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:57:53.992 --> 00:57:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.187 align:middle line:84%
Is that dangerous from
the male point of view?

00:57:57.187 --> 00:58:00.386 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:00.386 --> 00:58:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Probably.

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It takes two males to balance
her when she's strong.

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:09.350 align:middle line:84%
It takes one below
and one above.

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We did this work a long
time ago in one of them.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of people didn't
realize that that wasn't even

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.020 align:middle line:90%
four human beings.

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:17.910 align:middle line:90%
It was four planets.

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.680 align:middle line:84%
That's when we were activating
the Earth's Merkaba field.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And her Merkaba field had been
shut down for over 500 years.

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It was actually recorded
in the Mayan calendar.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:32.115 align:middle line:84%
It's about 528 years ago from
right now, approximately.

00:58:32.115 --> 00:58:35.755 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
Amaterasu in Japan,

00:58:35.755 --> 00:58:39.440 align:middle line:84%
it was exactly the same year
that she went inside the Earth

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.252 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:58:40.252 --> 00:58:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we went into this
darkness at that time.

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:46.350 align:middle line:90%


00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, just to keep it shorter
because we've to-- we've only

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.480 align:middle line:90%
got one minute--

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.399 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:53.399 --> 00:58:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I lost where I was
going with that.

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:02.295 align:middle line:90%
Got it to Amaterasu and--

00:59:02.295 --> 00:59:03.048 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:59:03.048 --> 00:59:05.846 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>The ideal.

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, the i-- well, the ideal
for us now for most people--

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and there are exceptions--
is a star tetrahedron--

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:18.220 align:middle line:84%
tetrahedronal Merkaba
rotating 34 times, 21 times.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's for us right now.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, once we make this
consciousness change,

00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:26.610 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go up
in energy dramatically.

00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Our body is going--
our body right now

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:32.160 align:middle line:84%
is almost pure mass
and very little energy.

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.670 align:middle line:84%
When we get through
here, our body

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:38.150 align:middle line:84%
is going to be almost pure
energy and very little mass.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:41.009 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I was fourth
dimensional right now,

00:59:41.009 --> 00:59:42.300 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't be able to see me.

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'd been here,
but you wouldn't

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:46.870 align:middle line:84%
be able to see me
because my atoms are

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:49.360 align:middle line:84%
at such tremendous
distances that you'd just

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.675 align:middle line:90%
see right through me.

00:59:50.675 --> 00:59:52.595 align:middle line:90%
It's really true of everything.

00:59:52.595 --> 00:59:54.274 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these walls
and everything,

00:59:54.274 --> 00:59:55.190 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing there.

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:58.210 align:middle line:90%


00:59:58.210 --> 00:59:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It's all space.

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just like looking
into the stars.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.830 align:middle line:90%
It's all space.

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:05.967 align:middle line:84%
There's very, very
little matter there.

01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:06.467 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:00:06.467 --> 01:00:10.690 align:middle line:90%


01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>So when I see through
my hand, is that the same?

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>As what?

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>As when I-- my hand
disappears and I look at it?

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it means that
you, your consciousness

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.180 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to-- as long as
it's not an illusion that's

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.372 align:middle line:90%
happening with you.

01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:30.231 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:30.730 align:middle line:90%


01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean that's
possible too.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But I know-- I've done
what you're talking about,

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and if you do, you're
starting to interface

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
with the fourth dimension and
you can see right through it.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.584 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of potential.

01:00:45.584 --> 01:00:48.000 align:middle line:84%
We can do all kinds of things,
and we don't have any idea,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.640 align:middle line:90%
so we don't do them.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But human potential
is just unbelievable.

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't happen
all over the world,

01:00:55.410 --> 01:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know that
we can do these things,

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:01.950 align:middle line:90%
and what's possible.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.010 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:04.460 align:middle line:84%
You could see right
through walls.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.720 align:middle line:90%
You can do amazing things.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.840 align:middle line:90%
You can even walk through walls.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
They've got three-- the
Chinese-- scientists.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They're scientific.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
They have completely recorded,
and using scientific method,

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
have now three human
beings that have

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.110 align:middle line:90%
walked through a solid wall.

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was recorded in the
science journals all the way

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:30.230 align:middle line:90%
up there.

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:32.140 align:middle line:90%
But other scientists read this.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
They go-- they don't even
know what to do with it.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.382 align:middle line:84%
They just turn the page
and keep going because they

01:01:37.382 --> 01:01:38.340 align:middle line:90%
don't know where it is.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
But it is-- they've
watched people do this.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Last-- I've been doing the
Merkaba for over six weeks,

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:53.000 align:middle line:90%
but I've been doing the single.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The left of the male and
the right of the female.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And just a single, and
that's why I couldn't quite

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:01.080 align:middle line:90%
understand the book.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But last night, I started
doing the set of--

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>You got the whole set going.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:07.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>And I always before
was cold, always cold.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>We actually have a
thermostat in our body.

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It's right here, the
thymus gland right here.

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And you can set it.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
You can change your thermostat
so you're warm or cool,

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:24.780 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And they teach this as
one of the sitas in India.

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a guy in Taos
when I was living there.

01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:33.040 align:middle line:90%
And he came out of India.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.540 align:middle line:84%
But it was in the
summer, and he was

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.140 align:middle line:84%
wearing shorts and a
t-shirt and nothing else.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.600 align:middle line:90%
No shoes or anything.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
approached winter in Taos,

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:45.080 align:middle line:90%
it gets 25 below zero.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.254 align:middle line:84%
And at 25 below zero, I remember
going, I'm in down jackets.

01:02:48.254 --> 01:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I've got stuff all over,
everything like that.

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's still in the
shorts and t-shirt,

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:55.092 align:middle line:84%
and we're just going for
a walk out in the snow.

01:02:55.092 --> 01:02:55.984 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:02:55.984 --> 01:02:56.880 align:middle line:90%


01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And he sits down.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
He just starts melting
everything around him.

01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:02.911 align:middle line:84%
And I had to talk to him
about this, you know?

01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:04.234 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:04.234 --> 01:03:04.834 align:middle line:90%


01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:05.750 align:middle line:90%
And he says, oh, yeah.

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:06.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just right here.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.511 align:middle line:90%
It's your thalamus.

01:03:07.511 --> 01:03:09.330 align:middle line:84%
You can just adjust it
with your intention.

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And once you set that, then
that's your temperature.

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I've never
been cold since then.

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I just don't get
cold hardly at all.

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I still wear jackets and
things, but I never get cold.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.920 align:middle line:90%
The disk that pops out.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
What's really interesting
is almost everybody

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.120 align:middle line:90%
got this one wrong.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:31.530 align:middle line:90%


01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:34.910 align:middle line:90%
It's like 80% or something.

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:36.802 align:middle line:84%
And it took us a long
time to figure it out.

01:03:36.802 --> 01:03:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
did figure it out,

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
it took us an even longer time
to figure out what it did.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And it changes the
nature of the chakras.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- it's not like
a really, really bad thing,

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's like taking a camera
and putting it out of focus.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good thing.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:57.130 align:middle line:90%
But it's really easy to correct.

01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Just wherever you
have it, you just

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
send it to the proper
place, and then that's it.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:02.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just intention.

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Just takes a second,
and it's over with.

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But right now, everybody
just take your hands

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and tell me by your
hands where you

01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
think your disk is
crossing through your body.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
One major disk that runs
through the whole thing that's

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
usually as wide as your entire--
it's the length of the Merkaba.

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.880 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a flying saucer.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But inside there is a
flat disk, actually.

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:30.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:31.280 align:middle line:90%
You all had different ideas.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
There's people-- a lot of people
were up here at the heart.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Some people were up here.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Some of you were down here.

01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Just quickly, this
star tetrahedron,

01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it from
directly through one of them,

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.840 align:middle line:90%
then the stars are equal.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you're looking at it
sideways like that, like this,

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:54.550 align:middle line:90%
it kind of looks like this.

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:58.446 align:middle line:90%


01:04:58.446 --> 01:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And then these
stars are smaller.

01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:06.780 align:middle line:90%
I exaggerated a little bit.

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.220 align:middle line:84%
These are smaller
and these are bigger.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And the disk runs directly
through the center of it.

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Exactly one half of it is
above, one half is below.

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is where--
the base of your spine.

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you're sitting in
here and this, in essence,

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
if you were sitting on the
ground, your disk is the floor,

01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
is about a 16th of
an inch difference.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And so if you've got it up here
or up here or somewhere else

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:42.929 align:middle line:84%
like that, wherever
you had it, we're

01:05:42.929 --> 01:05:44.595 align:middle line:84%
going to make all
these corrections when

01:05:44.595 --> 01:05:45.760 align:middle line:90%
we get back from the thing.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.260 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be more.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But all you do is
with your intention,

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
you just bring it
down to wherever

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.950 align:middle line:90%
it is so it's down there.

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're sitting on a chair,
it's the chair pretty much.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of an
important correction.

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:03.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes again
and look at your--

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
either look, see, or sense
or feel your tetrahedrons.

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And see if one of them
is bigger than the other.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:21.952 align:middle line:84%
Your first view,
that's usually correct.

01:06:21.952 --> 01:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And so how many people
found that one of them

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.740 align:middle line:90%
was bigger than the other?

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's probably
more than that.

01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Because what these
tetrahedrons are is

01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
they represent
all the polarities

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.280 align:middle line:90%
in your body in different ways.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Every single one of them.

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But the primary one,
the one where it all

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.445 align:middle line:84%
begins with is the top one is
your daddy and the bottom one

01:06:48.445 --> 01:06:50.970 align:middle line:90%
is your mommy.

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the polarity that
it all started with.

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you, especially in
the first-- from conception

01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
to the first three years of
life, if one of your parents

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:10.205 align:middle line:84%
was violent with you or angry
with you or abusive to you

01:07:10.205 --> 01:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
in some way, a child
experiences pain on a level

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
remember as adults.

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:19.780 align:middle line:90%
It's really huge.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.574 align:middle line:84%
And they do all these
things to get rid

01:07:21.574 --> 01:07:22.740 align:middle line:90%
of this pain and everything.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:28.490 align:middle line:90%


01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
What happens is the child
backs away from that parent

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:36.145 align:middle line:90%
internally in their heart.

01:07:36.145 --> 01:07:39.110 align:middle line:90%


01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are protecting
themselves, really,

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:42.970 align:middle line:90%
from the pain.

01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
in the tetrahedrons,

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.380 align:middle line:90%
the tetrahedron gets smaller.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.530 align:middle line:90%
It tightens up.

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And so if you put your
tetrahedrons on the screen,

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.840 align:middle line:84%
you can just look and see
what-- just by looking at it,

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
you're going to know pretty
much what your relationship is

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:04.173 align:middle line:84%
with your mother and your father
by seeing those tetrahedrons.

01:08:04.173 --> 01:08:07.320 align:middle line:90%


01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And you-- all I can say now
is you need-- if you can,

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:18.872 align:middle line:84%
if it's possible in
any way that you can,

01:08:18.872 --> 01:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
you need to begin to
release these traumas that

01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:27.109 align:middle line:84%
originated with your mom and
your dad, if there are any.

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And then really, you
need to start then

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:32.225 align:middle line:84%
going through all the
other people all the way up

01:08:32.225 --> 01:08:33.100 align:middle line:90%
and release them all.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.729 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
talking about before,

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
because your emotional
traumas will stop you.

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:40.632 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted
you to know that,

01:08:40.632 --> 01:08:42.479 align:middle line:84%
that if you have one
bigger than the other,

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:44.438 align:middle line:90%
that's what's going on.

01:08:44.438 --> 01:08:48.880 align:middle line:90%
You have something against them.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.215 align:middle line:90%
You might have both of them.

01:08:51.215 --> 01:08:52.233 align:middle line:90%
Both parents did it.

01:08:52.233 --> 01:08:53.399 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see both of them.

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:55.419 align:middle line:84%
Even though they should be
out here, they're in here

01:08:55.419 --> 01:08:56.252 align:middle line:90%
and they're smaller.

01:08:56.252 --> 01:09:00.120 align:middle line:90%


01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to make you
aware of that, really.

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
the reverse spin.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
This is another one
a lot of people do.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully there's
nobody here doing this.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people take a set
of these like this.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And instead of connecting
to the big ones that

01:09:16.050 --> 01:09:20.479 align:middle line:84%
are around their body,
they see-- usually it's

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:22.939 align:middle line:84%
a visual thing-- they
see a small set of them

01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:25.100 align:middle line:84%
like this, sitting
out in front of them.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.779 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're going
through the white light

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and the top one,
then the bottom,

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.759 align:middle line:84%
and going back and forth and
they're doing all their things,

01:09:31.759 --> 01:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing it
happen in front of them.

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:35.700 align:middle line:90%
They're not actually doing it.

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.729 align:middle line:84%
Is there anybody
doing that here?

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:38.410 align:middle line:90%
You are.

01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:39.069 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:42.550 align:middle line:90%


01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hate to be the
person to tell you this,

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.944 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't work.

01:09:47.944 --> 01:09:53.560 align:middle line:84%
It just simply won't
create a Merkaba field.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
What happens is the
only way that you

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:04.020 align:middle line:84%
can do it is to shift that
from those to the actual set.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind
and the heart has

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:07.760 align:middle line:90%
to connect to the real thing.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And if it tries to connect
to an imaginary one that's

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:14.680 align:middle line:84%
out in front of you,
it just won't work.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:20.526 align:middle line:84%
So when you get a chance,
you need to do that release.

01:10:20.526 --> 01:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Instead of seeing
one out there, you've

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
got to actually see
or sense or feel.

01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:26.746 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to see them.

01:10:26.746 --> 01:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
If you can't see them, a lot
of times that's what happens

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
is you can't see them, so
you can see them better

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.100 align:middle line:90%
if you do them in front.

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But you must connect
with the real ones,

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:41.781 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise the living
field won't generate itself.

01:10:41.781 --> 01:10:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.738 align:middle line:84%
>>How do you connect
with something

01:10:43.738 --> 01:10:46.975 align:middle line:84%
that you can't see,
sense, or feel?

01:10:46.975 --> 01:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
If my intention is just to allow
it to do what it does naturally

01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have any tactile
or sense of what they are,

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:58.040 align:middle line:90%
how do you connect to that?

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.605 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, there's a lot of things
we can't see, sense, or feel,

01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:02.230 align:middle line:90%
but we know it.

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:03.710 align:middle line:90%
It's like Bluetooth, you know?

01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the stuff
going between there,

01:11:06.170 --> 01:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
but you know it's real
because here you talk on this,

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's down there.

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And some things we
can't see, like air.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But we know it's there
because when it blows hard,

01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:18.560 align:middle line:90%
we can feel it.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But that was the problem in
the beginning when we first

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
started teaching these
out to the world,

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:27.966 align:middle line:84%
is that nobody could see
or sense these things out

01:11:27.966 --> 01:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
there even though
they're really there.

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:32.020 align:middle line:84%
You can put them on
a computer screen.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But very few people can do that
because of what is required.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The technology required to do
that is very, very, very, very

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:41.160 align:middle line:90%
expensive.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's only happened--
the Russians have done it,

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure the United
States has done it,

01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:50.360 align:middle line:84%
but probably not too many
other people have done it.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And it almost takes
faith, in a way.

01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I'll take this to another level
in terms of when people have--

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
what I've seen after I
don't know how many-- I have

01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:07.200 align:middle line:84%
no idea how many people I've
been in front of with this

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and looking at their fields,
but I've talked to lots of them.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.990 align:middle line:90%


01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is that
there's a spectrum.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And one end of the
spectrum is a person

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't sense or feel
anything when they do this.

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just nothing
going on at all.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other
end of the spectrum

01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
is a person who
has probably been

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
doing meditation
for many lifetimes

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and is aware of
this other level.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.732 align:middle line:90%
And they do this instantly.

01:12:37.732 --> 01:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
They float off the
ground, they can

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:40.814 align:middle line:84%
put their hands
through walls, and they

01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:42.145 align:middle line:90%
can do all these things.

01:12:42.145 --> 01:12:43.020 align:middle line:90%
And they go, oh yeah.

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.000 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But what we have is a spectrum
in between those two poles.

01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And most people are somewhere
in there, somewhere.

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And they'll feel it,
but they can't see it.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Or they can see it,
but they can't feel it.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Or there's all kinds of things.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
What I do know is it
doesn't make any difference.

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.660 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba is just as
real to that person who's

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.470 align:middle line:84%
floating off the
ground than to someone

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:14.630 align:middle line:90%
who can't feel anything.

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just as valid, and
functioning just as well.

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:24.910 align:middle line:90%
But it is a problem.

01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's a pretty
significant amount.

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:33.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like, about 15% or so of
the people can't feel a thing,

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.557 align:middle line:90%
and others can.

01:13:34.557 --> 01:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And you see this, and you
start talking to people.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And here, you'll see that
some people can actually see,

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:41.730 align:middle line:90%
which is the hardest of all.

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:46.280 align:middle line:84%
If you can actually see your
Merkaba-- that's hard for me.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It takes-- I have to sit
for about 15 minutes.

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Keep getting slow enough to
be able to get down to be

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.380 align:middle line:90%
able to sense those things.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was a really
bad student, anyway.

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.402 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:14:02.402 --> 01:14:03.270 align:middle line:90%


01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The angels kept going,
oh, God, Drunvalo.

01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:06.972 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:14:06.972 --> 01:14:07.960 align:middle line:90%


01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you know,
I'll never forget

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
when they told me to make
one of these out a cardboard.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what I was making.

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't told me
yet what it was yet.

01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:22.852 align:middle line:84%
So I'm holding this little tiny
cardboard thing about this big,

01:14:22.852 --> 01:14:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going--
you know, I'd never

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:25.657 align:middle line:90%
seen one before in my life.

01:14:25.657 --> 01:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they start telling
me about how important

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.394 align:middle line:84%
it is in the universe,
and I'm going--

01:14:30.394 --> 01:14:31.189 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:32.230 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be kidding.

01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:32.729 align:middle line:90%
This is--

01:14:32.729 --> 01:14:34.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, and the it took me a
long time to get to the place

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.950 align:middle line:84%
where they said I had
to do the meditation.

01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:41.490 align:middle line:90%
But I just kept forgetting.

01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd do it for three or
four days and then, pfft.

01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm off in the forest playing
flute or something else

01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:46.530 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go about two weeks
and they'd kind of, Drunvalo.

01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:51.660 align:middle line:90%
You've got to meditate.

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah!

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:53.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.120 align:middle line:90%
The meditation thing.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.610 align:middle line:90%
And so we're all different.

01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are who we
are, and it's OK.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:10.260 align:middle line:84%
This is not something--
nobody's going to fail this.

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.390 align:middle line:90%
We're all going to be fine.

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to remember.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:18.561 align:middle line:90%
But it is kind of tricky.

01:15:18.561 --> 01:15:20.436 align:middle line:84%
If you are in a position
where you can't feel

01:15:20.436 --> 01:15:21.894 align:middle line:84%
or sense or anything,
you just have

01:15:21.894 --> 01:15:24.720 align:middle line:84%
to go-- this is
where I think-- this

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is where my wife could
step in, because she

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.900 align:middle line:90%
is pure female at work.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm pure male pretty much,
and she's pure female.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And her work would really
help a lot of people

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
like that, because she
doesn't do any of these things

01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:41.230 align:middle line:90%
with logic.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It's all just with images.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And she can-- she could
move consciousness around

01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:49.494 align:middle line:90%
with images.

01:15:49.494 --> 01:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And she's getting
really good right now,

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.451 align:middle line:84%
because she's been working
for the last year and a half

01:15:53.451 --> 01:15:59.145 align:middle line:84%
in Moscow for these large
corporations, helping them--

01:15:59.145 --> 01:15:59.831 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:15:59.831 --> 01:16:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Hm?

01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Uralsib right?

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Uralsib.

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And she appears to really
be helping them from what

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
we're-- the feedback,
what we're getting.

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:15.610 align:middle line:90%


01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But in teaching with
them, she's learned a lot.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:22.752 align:middle line:84%
She has really--
she's got almost as

01:16:22.752 --> 01:16:23.960 align:middle line:90%
much as they've got from her.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.940 align:middle line:90%
She's got a lot from them.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
She's really fallen
in love with them now.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.140 align:middle line:90%
She loves the Russians.

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.955 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:16:30.955 --> 01:16:31.770 align:middle line:90%


01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:36.900 align:middle line:84%
It's-- she sees who they are
because she's seen through

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
their eyes so much, and she
understands all they've been

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
through and all the
pain and all the stuff.

01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:47.509 align:middle line:84%
And so she-- at first, she
didn't-- she just wanted to do

01:16:47.509 --> 01:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
a couple and leave.

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.841 align:middle line:84%
But now she's at the point where
she wants to keep doing this

01:16:50.841 --> 01:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- she's learning
so much, and the same time,

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.820 align:middle line:90%
it's helping so many people.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.372 align:middle line:84%
But she may teach here
next year, we hope.

01:17:00.372 --> 01:17:01.830 align:middle line:84%
We're really--
Diane and I are both

01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
trying to get her to do
this, do four of them.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's incredibly
different than anything

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.680 align:middle line:90%
that I'm doing at all.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It's totally female.

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
logic to anything.

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.850 align:middle line:90%
There's no--

01:17:15.850 --> 01:17:16.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:16.920 align:middle line:90%


01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, I listen to what she's
doing, and I've been through it

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.390 align:middle line:90%
and I watch it.

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And you see all of the sudden
she does something like, see

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.460 align:middle line:90%
a tree.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Now see a dog over here.

01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:29.981 align:middle line:90%
Now see a star.

01:17:29.981 --> 01:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And you do that, and then
everybody in the room cries.

01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:32.729 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:32.729 --> 01:17:33.610 align:middle line:90%
And you're going--

01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:36.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:36.680 align:middle line:90%


01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:40.450 align:middle line:90%
There's no why.

01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:42.735 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:42.735 --> 01:17:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Forget the why thing.

01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
It just does, you know?

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:47.610 align:middle line:90%
And I can't explain it.

01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:48.620 align:middle line:90%
I've really tried.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I've given up, kind of.

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I understand a lot more than
I did when I first started.

01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:57.123 align:middle line:84%
But when you're male,
you're just not female.

01:17:57.123 --> 01:18:01.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:02.810 align:middle line:90%


01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:05.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just, I can't
get there from here.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I don't
know what to say.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.730 align:middle line:84%
That question's been asked to
me so many times that I just

01:18:15.730 --> 01:18:17.021 align:middle line:90%
don't know where to go with it.

01:18:17.021 --> 01:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Because you just have to
hang in there long enough.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.820 align:middle line:84%
With the work that
we're doing today

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:26.290 align:middle line:84%
now, or over the
next five days, it

01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:27.550 align:middle line:90%
may change for you completely.

01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Because now it's not
about an outer field.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.724 align:middle line:84%
It's about your heart
and your inner work.

01:18:34.724 --> 01:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And once you-- the Merkaba is
pretty much useless until it's

01:18:39.970 --> 01:18:42.240 align:middle line:90%
connected to the heart.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't even need to
think about that at that point.

01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:53.695 align:middle line:84%
The way that life uses it
is kind of like a remote.

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:56.980 align:middle line:90%


01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It kind of uses it like
a television or so.

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's a thing out
here that can create images.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.660 align:middle line:90%
You understand more.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.074 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
really think about it much.

01:19:07.074 --> 01:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And once you really
get into your heart,

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
you can forget about doing
all this stuff and everything.

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.740 align:middle line:90%
It will link solid.

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just trying to
encourage you a little.

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.068 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:19.068 --> 01:19:20.740 align:middle line:90%


01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.186 align:middle line:90%
Another question?

01:19:22.186 --> 01:19:22.686 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:19:22.686 --> 01:19:25.644 align:middle line:90%


01:19:25.644 --> 01:19:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>This happens just very rarely.

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:33.805 align:middle line:84%
But time to time, I'll get
really dizzy and nauseous.

01:19:33.805 --> 01:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
what causes that.

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:38.572 align:middle line:84%
>>How long you been
doing the Merkaba?

01:19:38.572 --> 01:19:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Since January.

01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we now have
something superimposed

01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:46.280 align:middle line:90%
over the top of this.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.870 align:middle line:90%


01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I have-- way back in the
'90s, occasionally someone

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:54.859 align:middle line:84%
would say that they
would get dizzy.

01:19:54.859 --> 01:19:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And because you really
are having something

01:19:56.650 --> 01:20:01.330 align:middle line:84%
spinning around you
at a very fast speed.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But my intuition is
that what's going on

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
with you is probably
not that, but it has

01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:09.200 align:middle line:90%
to do with the magnetic field.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about this,
I think on the third day,

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.340 align:middle line:90%
there's a bunch of symptoms.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel these
symptoms, then you're

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:18.826 align:middle line:84%
going to realize
what's going on,

01:20:18.826 --> 01:20:23.437 align:middle line:84%
and then how to fix it is what
we're trying to figure out now.

01:20:23.437 --> 01:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And the world doesn't
know what to do.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:30.820 align:middle line:84%
All the world knows is that
it's affecting people's health.

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:33.760 align:middle line:90%


01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.176 align:middle line:84%
Let me keep going with
this a little bit more.

01:20:36.176 --> 01:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%


01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Another thing, just
so you know, is

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that when you're making
the Merkaba field,

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:51.800 align:middle line:84%
the analogy of a tree and
a seed is very similar.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:52.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a living field.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mechanical thing.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, like wheels
rotating around or something.

01:20:57.570 --> 01:20:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It's living.

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
it when I first

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.130 align:middle line:90%
wrote those first two books.

01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was the brain
and the heart working.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:09.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the left and right brain.

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And the left brain
is going this way,

01:21:11.410 --> 01:21:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and the right brain
is going that way.

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:19.070 align:middle line:90%
And it has a-- but it's alive.

01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:20.560 align:middle line:90%
It's part of your consciousness.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
separate from you.

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.062 align:middle line:90%
It is part of you.

01:21:23.062 --> 01:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And eventually you're going
to find out it's way more

01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:26.380 align:middle line:90%
than you think it is.

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It actually is the
universe itself.

01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:32.550 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't got there yet.

01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But the analogy is like when
you're just starting this,

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
normally it takes a
very, very long time,

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:41.080 align:middle line:90%
and it happens naturally.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.300 align:middle line:90%
It just occurs.

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.720 align:middle line:84%
If you reach a certain
level of consciousness,

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.650 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you look
like externally, you reach--

01:21:47.650 --> 01:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
there's-- consciousness
is consciousness,

01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:51.670 align:middle line:90%
no matter what you look like.

01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:53.589 align:middle line:84%
And there's various
levels of this.

01:21:53.589 --> 01:21:55.880 align:middle line:84%
When you get to this level,
this polarity consciousness

01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:06.054 align:middle line:84%
level, and you-- when you start
over every day when you're

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:08.470 align:middle line:84%
doing this, you're actually
bringing it up from your navel

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:09.700 align:middle line:90%
to your heart.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And each day you're
starting over.

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:12.857 align:middle line:90%
This is synthetic.

01:22:12.857 --> 01:22:13.690 align:middle line:90%
This is not natural.

01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.810 align:middle line:84%
This is not the way
it normally happens.

01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
It normally happens over usually
at least 100 to 150,000 years.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Before-- and then one day you
wake up and you go, oh, yeah.

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.460 align:middle line:90%
And you understand it.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just like--
it's like a little tree.

01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:35.470 align:middle line:84%
If you plant a seed and
you put it in the ground,

01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:38.150 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep
watering that tree

01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:40.365 align:middle line:84%
and protect it, and maybe
put little things around it

01:22:40.365 --> 01:22:41.740 align:middle line:84%
or a fence around
it or something

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.590 align:middle line:90%
to protect it to grow up.

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have to keep
watering it every single day,

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:50.050 align:middle line:84%
or you have to keep
your attention on it.

01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But once that tree
gets up pretty big,

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:55.830 align:middle line:90%
you can kind of let go.

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:57.280 align:middle line:90%
It will take off on its own.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.195 align:middle line:84%
It's got its roots
down in there.

01:22:59.195 --> 01:23:01.570 align:middle line:84%
It's connected into
water, and that's it.

01:23:01.570 --> 01:23:03.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
protect it anymore.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It'll take off.

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Merkaba's
the same kind of way.

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
When you first start doing it,
requires a lot of attention,

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.930 align:middle line:90%
and it takes about two years.

01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And you have to keep doing
this every year, every day.

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And you have to keep--
it's a long process.

01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But after two years, the
Merkaba is permanent.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
stop ever again.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It'll just take off
as part of your-- even

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.280 align:middle line:84%
if you were to die
and reincarnate,

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.452 align:middle line:84%
your Merkaba would
still be with you.

01:23:32.452 --> 01:23:33.410 align:middle line:90%
It would stay with you.

01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:35.315 align:middle line:84%
It's part of your
consciousness now.

01:23:35.315 --> 01:23:36.930 align:middle line:90%
It isn't part of the body.

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:39.320 align:middle line:90%
It's part of your consciousness.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But your body is part of
your consciousness too.

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:45.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not separate from
your consciousness either.

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>After you finish the Merkaba
meditation and you walk around

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and you are aware of
the Merkaba field,

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
you see the center of the
spheres in the heart chakra

01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:58.590 align:middle line:90%
or in the navel.

01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you already
feel it here, why

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:02.600 align:middle line:84%
do you need all
the time when you

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
begin to study from the navel
and bring it back to there?

01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>The reason is because
everybody is centered

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.150 align:middle line:90%
at the navel right now.

01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's because the Earth is.

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has been centered
there for a long time.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.940 align:middle line:84%
But where she's going and
what she's doing with hers

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and what we're trying to get
everybody else to trigger

01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
is to move it up to
the heart chakra.

01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And so on the 14th breath, we
move it up to the heart chakra.

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's only good for
47 hours, and it will--

01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:34.860 align:middle line:90%
[TICK]

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.920 align:middle line:90%
--die after 47 hours.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And so once a day or definitely
before the 47th hour,

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.390 align:middle line:90%
you have to do this again.

01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And you do it by
starting all over again

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.090 align:middle line:90%
and bringing it back up.

01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:48.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not natural.

01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:50.150 align:middle line:90%
It's synthetic.

01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Everything that the Earth has
been doing with consciousness

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.430 align:middle line:90%
is synthetic.

01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:57.250 align:middle line:84%
If you go way back even to
the Egyptians 6,000 years ago,

01:24:57.250 --> 01:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
they were building pyramids,
physical pyramids using rods,

01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
tuning forks, [? frails ?],
all of these things

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.160 align:middle line:90%
to raise consciousness.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's not normal.

01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:12.780 align:middle line:90%
It's synthetic.

01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:16.970 align:middle line:84%
6,000 years before
that, a little more,

01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:18.634 align:middle line:84%
we basically got a
bump on our head.

01:25:18.634 --> 01:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Something happened during
the time of Atlantis

01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that caused us-- we were already
entering into that level,

01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and then we lost it.

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Then we came down.

01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then so life said, if we
hadn't have already entered

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
into it, the rest
of the universe

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
would not have allowed us
to do what I'm doing now.

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But because we'd already
entered into it--

01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and it really was only a
small number of people--

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:44.850 align:middle line:90%
but nevertheless, we had got it.

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But because we had
achieved it once,

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:50.374 align:middle line:84%
then they gave us permission
to go back and do it again.

01:25:50.374 --> 01:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
But in doing it, we're
doing it synthetically.

01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:55.610 align:middle line:90%


01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't always work.

01:25:58.710 --> 01:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We've watched many, many, many,
many planets go through this

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
before, and a lot
of times-- I don't

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.870 align:middle line:84%
know what the
percentage is, but-- it

01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:10.824 align:middle line:84%
works more than it doesn't
work-- but still, there's

01:26:10.824 --> 01:26:12.240 align:middle line:84%
lots of times when
it doesn't work

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and the whole planet just dies.

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't make it.

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:18.040 align:middle line:90%


01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So you have to know
that it's not--

01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:21.130 align:middle line:90%
this is not a normal thing.

01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
This is one way that they
have found a long time ago

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:25.550 align:middle line:90%
that works.

01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you'll bring
it up here about two years--

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:30.231 align:middle line:84%
if you just started today,
at about two years from now,

01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:33.080 align:middle line:84%
you'll bring it up here
and it'll just stay there.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even have to do
this ever again or anything.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It's going to stay there.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of you.

01:26:39.130 --> 01:26:41.382 align:middle line:84%
>>So when you see
doing the day, you

01:26:41.382 --> 01:26:43.590 align:middle line:90%
see during the heart chakra.

01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:45.432 align:middle line:90%
During the day, you're up here.

01:26:45.432 --> 01:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But then every time
you start over,

01:26:46.890 --> 01:26:49.348 align:middle line:84%
you've got to bring it back
down here and bring it back up.

01:26:49.348 --> 01:26:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like,
you know, like one

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:54.020 align:middle line:84%
of these wheels in
playgrounds, and you

01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:56.750 align:middle line:84%
have to just keep giving it
a push to keep it spinning.

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:58.541 align:middle line:90%
You have to keep doing this.

01:26:58.541 --> 01:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to bring your
hand back over here

01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and do it again, and bring
it over here and do it again.

01:27:02.670 --> 01:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But eventually if that
wheel is done right

01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:11.824 align:middle line:84%
through vacuum energy, it
would just keep going forever.

01:27:11.824 --> 01:27:15.600 align:middle line:90%


01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.420 align:middle line:84%
How many people, when
they were doing this-- I

01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
know because I was following my
instructions from the angels,

01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:27.410 align:middle line:84%
they said on the top one
to see white light in it

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:32.160 align:middle line:84%
like lightning, which is
just the color of pure prana.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you move it
down on the other one.

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:38.560 align:middle line:84%
How many people noticed as
you started doing this--

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing wrong with
this-- how many people noticed

01:27:41.370 --> 01:27:43.485 align:middle line:84%
that when you started
doing it, it wasn't white?

01:27:43.485 --> 01:27:44.980 align:middle line:84%
It started changing
colors, and it

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:49.350 align:middle line:84%
started becoming all
different kinds of colors.

01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Can I see with hands
how many people?

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.380 align:middle line:90%
There's no rules.

01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is really
going on is the angels

01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
gave it to this-- well,
I understood this later

01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.750 align:middle line:90%
from them.

01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
They gave us kind of like
a generic version of it.

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And they assumed
that you were going

01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:09.985 align:middle line:84%
to learn these things
as you went along,

01:28:09.985 --> 01:28:11.410 align:middle line:90%
what was really going on here.

01:28:11.410 --> 01:28:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And interesting enough,
not very many people did.

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:17.710 align:middle line:90%
It's communication.

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:21.395 align:middle line:84%
It's communication between
your higher self and you.

01:28:21.395 --> 01:28:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch
these colors changing

01:28:23.370 --> 01:28:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and everything else like
that, you have to feel them.

01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You can't think
of them logically.

01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:30.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's like
listening to music.

01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
You can't go-- you can get
into the logical side of music,

01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:36.920 align:middle line:90%
but it's boring.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.460 align:middle line:90%
But you have to feel them.

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, you will feel
what they're saying to you.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
communicate with you.

01:28:46.050 --> 01:28:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't just
sight and that.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.205 align:middle line:90%
It's all of your senses.

01:28:50.205 --> 01:28:51.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all five.

01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:52.360 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Right now you have five.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.420 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
six pretty soon.

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And actually seven and
then it jumps to 12, 13.

01:28:58.370 --> 01:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be about 13
here, not too long from now.

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.750 align:middle line:90%
But right now we have five.

01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So there's sight.

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:06.660 align:middle line:90%
There's sound.

01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:11.010 align:middle line:84%
How many people
hear their Merkaba?

01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I know you do.

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.840 align:middle line:90%
You told me.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.350 align:middle line:90%
You do?

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:17.530 align:middle line:90%
You do.

01:29:17.530 --> 01:29:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's other things.

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.170 align:middle line:90%
There's smell.

01:29:20.170 --> 01:29:26.090 align:middle line:84%
There's-- a lot of people smell
flowers or different kinds

01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
of things that are in
the air around there.

01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:29.820 align:middle line:90%
It's usually very positive.

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But if it's negative,
what we-- when

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.136 align:middle line:84%
we say positive or
negative, that's

01:29:34.136 --> 01:29:36.010 align:middle line:84%
just because we're in
polarity consciousness.

01:29:36.010 --> 01:29:37.676 align:middle line:84%
If you're communicating
with your higher

01:29:37.676 --> 01:29:39.680 align:middle line:84%
self, which is in
unity consciousness,

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.355 align:middle line:90%
they don't see that.

01:29:41.355 --> 01:29:42.610 align:middle line:90%
They don't think that way.

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:45.920 align:middle line:90%


01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And then there's touch.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.052 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody ever done their
Merkaba and then felt--

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.016 align:middle line:90%
[STATIC]

01:29:52.016 --> 01:29:54.908 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:54.908 --> 01:29:56.840 align:middle line:90%


01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
--felt yourself, or felt
something touching you?

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you get to
touch, your higher self

01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:09.240 align:middle line:90%
is really close.

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.090 align:middle line:84%
They are really,
really, really close.

01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:13.500 align:middle line:90%
They are really focused on you.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:25.425 align:middle line:90%


01:30:25.425 --> 01:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going down
to the Angel Ceremony.

01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:31.510 align:middle line:90%
This begins this whole workshop.

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
important ceremony.

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:38.490 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it begins
to open our hearts in a way

01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:42.550 align:middle line:84%
that we normally don't
encounter in our everyday lives.

01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And through a very
sacred way, where

01:30:44.410 --> 01:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I bless in the four
directions and I

01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:48.730 align:middle line:84%
make a sacred
space for us all, I

01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:51.043 align:middle line:90%
have you chant hu, which is H-U.

01:30:51.043 --> 01:30:51.709 align:middle line:90%
>>(CHANTING) Hu.

01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:55.095 align:middle line:90%


01:30:55.095 --> 01:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>And while you're
chanting that,

01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I will be going around
and doing something

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that temporarily brings all
of your chakras into balance.

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't last a long time,
but it helps in this ceremony.

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And then after we do
that, I will say prayers,

01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and we will then get
to the Angel Ceremony.

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The Angel Ceremony is
a very specific thing.

01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:18.730 align:middle line:90%
It's very old.

01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Every person on
Earth has two angels

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.650 align:middle line:90%
that are connected to them.

01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:25.600 align:middle line:84%
They may not know this, but
they have to have to in order

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.490 align:middle line:90%
to have polarity.

01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
of you on Earth.

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:33.630 align:middle line:84%
You divide your spirit into two
different people, usually one

01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:35.380 align:middle line:90%
male and one female.

01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's an angel associated
with each one of those people.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.385 align:middle line:84%
And this one angel
will know who they are.

01:31:40.385 --> 01:31:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Now you may not even
believe in angels.

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.260 align:middle line:84%
You may not think
that they're real,

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.800 align:middle line:90%
but just go through this anyway.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.000 align:middle line:84%
What happens here is
that real angel is

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.900 align:middle line:90%
going to stand in front of you.

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And then at the right
time in the ceremony,

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.952 align:middle line:84%
with your permission
of course, we

01:31:54.952 --> 01:31:56.410 align:middle line:84%
will turn them
around where they're

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:58.610 align:middle line:84%
facing toward the
center of the circle.

01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:02.760 align:middle line:84%
They're going to move back
and become part of you

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.990 align:middle line:90%
for the next five days.

01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:05.582 align:middle line:90%
They will be part of your body.

01:32:05.582 --> 01:32:08.040 align:middle line:84%
They will sleep with you, they
will look through your eyes,

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and they will begin to
help you understand what is

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.160 align:middle line:90%
about to be presented to you.

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.045 align:middle line:84%
When you have a problem and
you don't understand something,

01:32:16.045 --> 01:32:18.390 align:middle line:84%
you can close your eyes,
connect with this angel

01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to soon
become familiar with,

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and they can tell you
anything you need to know.

01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:27.575 align:middle line:84%
It is the beginning of what
is called your higher self.

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:30.380 align:middle line:84%
A higher self has higher
selves to higher selves.

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.340 align:middle line:90%
There are many higher selves.

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Other beings that
actually are you

01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:36.990 align:middle line:90%
on another level of existence.

01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
They actually interface
directly in the fourth dimension

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.770 align:middle line:90%
with human beings.

01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And they are you, and you
exist on that level also.

01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so this is who you're going
to be connecting with when

01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:50.465 align:middle line:90%
they walk back into your body.

01:32:50.465 --> 01:32:52.190 align:middle line:90%
It is not somebody else.

01:32:52.190 --> 01:32:54.820 align:middle line:84%
It is you on another
level of existence.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.560 align:middle line:90%
And for this reason, it's OK.

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You can relax and
let this happen.

01:32:58.550 --> 01:33:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Once it does happen,
they will stay here

01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:05.090 align:middle line:84%
for the entire five days that
we are doing this workshop.

01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And then at that end of those
five days, they will leave you.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:11.990 align:middle line:84%
If you wish them to stay longer,
that's between you and them,

01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:13.460 align:middle line:90%
and you can talk to them.

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But right now, it's only
for these five days.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the prayer
that we say right

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
before we bring in
the angels, and this

01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:25.050 align:middle line:90%
is how the prayer goes.

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Great spirit, mother, father,
child, God, creator of all life

01:33:29.530 --> 01:33:32.950 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, we thank
you for these circles,

01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and we thank you
for the love that is

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.370 align:middle line:90%
flowing through these circles.

01:33:36.370 --> 01:33:38.590 align:middle line:84%
For without this
love, we would never

01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:43.300 align:middle line:84%
be able to see you in the eyes
of every person before us.

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And may all the
beings of light who

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
wish there to be love and
truth and beauty and trust

01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and harmony and peace
and reverence for God,

01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:54.940 align:middle line:84%
may the beings that
hold these principles

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and that are working with
us now be here to help us

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:01.590 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
what is being given to us,

01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and we can live it and
breathe it and make it

01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.240 align:middle line:90%
real here on Earth now, today.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.800 align:middle line:90%


01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Now for the Angel
Ceremony, we are

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.650 align:middle line:84%
going to invite the
angels in at this time.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
go inside yourself

01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:21.470 align:middle line:84%
to invoke them or
ask them to come out

01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:23.532 align:middle line:90%
and to be here in front of you.

01:34:23.532 --> 01:34:24.990 align:middle line:84%
