00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>Just so we're
clear, everything

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.060 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
talking about from now on

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.970 align:middle line:84%
is really two things--
to find ways for you

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.180 align:middle line:84%
to remember who you really are,
because we've forgotten this.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.440 align:middle line:90%
This is all remembering.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And everything will
also be focused

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.247 align:middle line:90%
on the creation process.

00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned this once already,
but I'm going to say it again.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It's on exactly how
things came into being,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:84%
so you understand how you
got this body, and where

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
this planet came from, and
all these other things.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So you get it,
you understand it,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and you know how
to do it as well.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:84%
You can't go on into
Ascension if you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:90%
don't know those two things.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:90%
You will remain human.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:90%
You will die.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
You'll go through the death
process and into another level.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:90%
The spirit never dies.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.946 align:middle line:90%
You can't be destroyed.

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:02.695 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
You have been around from
the beginning of everything.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And you will be around
till the end and beyond.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.100 align:middle line:84%
You are greater
than this universe.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.335 align:middle line:84%
You are the one who created
it in the first place.

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And so everything is aimed
at getting your memory back,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and trying to
remember who you are,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and what your relationship is
with everything, and exactly

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:90%
how this process works.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
As you enter into
higher consciousness,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand that
there's a time lag here.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.729 align:middle line:90%
It's not very long.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
It depends a lot on
how you build it.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.169 align:middle line:84%
But when you create
something here,

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:84%
there's usually a little
bit of a time lag,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.793 align:middle line:90%
and then it happens.

00:01:49.793 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And we don't realize that
we're doing everything.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
From the fourth dimension on,
it's instantaneous, absolutely

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:90%
instantaneous.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:84%
When you create something--
poof-- it's there.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no ch-- ch-- or waiting
for it, or anything like that.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to put your
timer on or something like that.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:90%
It'll happen instantly.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But most people
doing it don't know

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
that that's what's
happening, and so that's

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:90%
part of the problem.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to remember
not only who you are,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:90%
but how you do these things.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But as we unfold
these two things,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.012 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do all kinds
of things from here on out.

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of them won't look
like they have anything

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
to do with what
we're doing here,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and other ones will
be pretty obvious.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's a procedure that has
taken a long time to develop,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.524 align:middle line:90%
and it works pretty well.

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
By the time you get out of
here, I think most of you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
will have a much expanded
view of who you are,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on in this
world, and everything else.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I don't think I
need to talk about that.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.315 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go straight
forward, forward, forward

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It was Hermes who said the
words, "as above, so below."

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:90%
That was 2,000 years ago.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It took us just about 2,000
years to figure it out.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're just now
beginning to understand

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that if you look at the Earth
circling around the sun,

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and you go down and
look at an atom,

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
you see the electrons
circulating around, moving

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
around that, only at
9/10 the speed of light.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
That you can just intuitively
see this relationship

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:84%
as you go smaller and
smaller, or bigger and bigger,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that everything
is interconnected.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But that one, we're
pretty much getting that.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.794 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not perfectly, but we've
got a pretty good understanding

00:03:58.794 --> 00:03:59.293 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
But the one that
we don't get at all

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:84%
is the other part
of what Hermes said,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
which was "as
within, so without."

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is a creation process.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
What goes on in here is what
creates what's out there.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to learn
what's going on inside here.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:90%
They are directly related.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Nothing happens in
the universe that you

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:90%
don't have a responsibility in.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know it seems big
to do something like that,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:90%
but it's still true.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We believe-- and I'm going
to jump ahead a little bit--

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
we believe that the stars, and
the planets, and all that stuff

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:84%
has been there for at
least 16, 17 billion years,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and that it's just
the way it is.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But from a Melchizedek point of
view, we have a different view.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been there
very long, actually.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't even there.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
out there at all.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.250 align:middle line:90%
There are no stars.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:90%
There are no planets.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have a body.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
A better modern day
way of thinking of it

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
is it's just a hologram, it's
just an image that was created,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't actually exist.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But we get emotionally
connected into it.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:84%
You remember that movie
"Contact" by Jodie Foster?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And so for those
of you who saw it,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
she's who is in a
pentagonal dodecahedron

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and dropped through that
thing for a few seconds.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And in those seconds, she went
deep into space, and time,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.965 align:middle line:84%
and dimension, and came
out on some planet that

00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:84%
had a bunch of stars, and moons,
and things that were around it.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And at first, she's in
a solid metal thing.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And then she starts seeing
that image appearing just out

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:90%
of her fingertips.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon,
there's a beach there.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's one point
which is very important.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
She reached forward
and put her finger out,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.687 align:middle line:84%
and the beach rippled,
which showed you

00:06:06.687 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:90%
that it was just an image.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.330 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't really a beach.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But a moment later, she
started looking into it

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and seeing somebody
walking toward her.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And she got so much into
it that the metal container

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
she was in disappeared,
and she was on this beach

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:90%
with all that stuff.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is pretty
much how it is.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
We are not where
we think we are.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
We are not doing
what we think we are.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And nothing that we know
is what we think it is.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
We are living in just
100% complete illusion.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
make this jump over

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.304 align:middle line:84%
into a world that
is really uniquely

00:06:47.304 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
different than
anything we've been

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:84%
told in school, or from
our parents, or anyone.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:90%
It is not what we think.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I don't expect
you to believe this.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you go deep
enough into what

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:84%
we're doing into meditation,
you come to a point

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
where you understand, and you
begin to see that it's true.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
There are many other
universes besides this one.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about dimensional worlds,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
or parallel worlds, or any
of these kind of ideas.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
There are literally other
creations of other universes

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that have nothing
to do with this one.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is
no place inside

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
of all these stars and
planets that you can reach

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:90%
any of these other universes.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Except one, and it's
always inside the heart

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:90%
of a human being or a person.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
In their heart, there is
a tiny, tiny little place,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and that place is where all
other universes were created.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's a near
infinite number

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:90%
inside of everybody's heart.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Other places that
don't look like this,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:90%
don't feel like this, nothing.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But they're worlds that
other people have created,

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:90%
which is really us.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And from there, in
that tiny space,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
you can actually step
out and come back

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:90%
into another universe.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.390 align:middle line:84%
But you can't get
there from-- there's

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
no portal or anything
here that will get you

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:84%
from here to any of
these other creations,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:90%
because they don't exist.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
They only have their roots or
their stem within your heart.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I know this is
different than what

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
many people feel about their
reality, especially scientists,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's nothing new.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
You can go back into the
Vedas 6,000 years ago,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about
this very same thing.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
In Hinduism, the world
is called "maya."

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:90%
It's illusion.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:84%
What it actually means
is simply "not true."

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:90%
It just isn't true.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And we must also
begin to understand

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
what we mean by it's not true,
because in order to step over

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get into the
creation process on this level,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
you can't do it
with this mindset

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:90%
that this stuff is really there.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to
understand the nature

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:90%
of what you're looking at.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The most distant stars are
right at your fingertips.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe is right
here, right out, that far away.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It's out of the Leonardo sphere.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the imaging
sphere of your Merkaba.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And before we get
out of here, we're

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:84%
going to trace the entire
mapping of consciousness

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.842 align:middle line:84%
inside the body, exactly how
it's all linked together,

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and which glands,
and how it works,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and all these kinds
of things, so you

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
can see clearly how this
works, and then you can do it.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And you will eventually
have to come to this place

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:84%
where you take the courage
to leap over and begin

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:90%
to actually create things.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, not so that
you actually are

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:84%
creating whatever that thing
is, but so that you can see

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:90%
the process of how it works.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into this in great
detail, really great detail,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:90%
before we get out of here.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that's
connected to that "as within,

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
so without," is the
nature that love

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
has to do, the role that it
plays in the creation process.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:90%
It is primary.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:84%
You have no power
if you have no love.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
The creation process
requires love.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And it requires a very
certain kind of love.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever you go from
love and you go into fear,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:84%
you lose your
ability to do this.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
If you're literally in
fear, you can't enter

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:90%
into the creation process.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do it.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't be totally
shaking in your boots

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:90%
and trying to do this.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It will not work.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to be in this
expanded, open place.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Vulnerable, not
afraid, absolutely

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
fearless of anything,
fearless of death,

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
fearless of pain
or anything else,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.450 align:middle line:84%
where you know your
connection to God.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can sit in this place
and then do this process

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
from your heart without
any fear at all.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
The moment fear enters in--
[SOUND EFFECT]-- it's over.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to show you
this directly, right now.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
through an experiment,

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and you can see for yourself
what I'm talking about.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:45.347 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to do this, we
begin by you finding a partner.

00:11:45.347 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do this
in direct experience.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:90%
So somebody just find a partner.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if
it's male or female.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
None of that stuff
matters to me,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.195 align:middle line:84%
just as long as you find
someone, hopefully, you like.

00:11:55.195 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.875 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to do this if
you at least like them.

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like
them, maybe you

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
should find another
partner if you can.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.255 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
get the partner,

00:12:09.255 --> 00:12:10.652 align:middle line:90%
then we're going to start.

00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:13.886 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.886 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:90%
This is always like magic to me.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
People just make little
links and things like this,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and then everybody
has a partner.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, at this point, who
does not have a partner?

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.880 align:middle line:84%
If the people that
do not have a partner

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
would go to the back of
the room, back there so

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:90%
you can all be together.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And we can call that
the singles bar.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you guys can
just meet and decide

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:90%
who you want to be with.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, next thing is you have
to be together physically

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:90%
with your partner.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care, you can move
these chairs any way you want.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:90%
You can sit on the ground.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:90%
You can do anything you want.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But just get where you're
facing your partner.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:06.275 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:06.775 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:06.775 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.422 align:middle line:90%
That's enough socializing.

00:13:13.422 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's
facing your partner.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Now move close enough
so your knees touch.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you're wearing
glasses, if you can remove--

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:90%
it's better without them.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.079 align:middle line:84%
But if you can't see
the end of your nose,

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:90%
then maybe you need them.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.661 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:29.661 --> 00:13:33.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:84%
The energies work better if you
don't have them on because you

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:90%
don't have to see.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be
looking at the person's

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:90%
surface of their body.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be looking
in a different way.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Now just face your partner
and close your eyes.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, your
knees have to touch.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
You want to physically
be touching,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:90%
but just a little tiny bit.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, just close your eyes.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And begin to breathe,
and feel the prana

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.536 align:middle line:84%
coming from above and below, and
meeting in your heart chakra.

00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:90%
You can feel that prana too.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And feel it, and see it, or
sense it turn into a sphere.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Or see this sphere,
or sense this sphere.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.595 align:middle line:84%
It's about the size of two hand
lengths, like a big basketball.

00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Now let me just explain
what we're going to do.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have an
interaction with your partner.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.312 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.312 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
First, we're going to
do something, which

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:90%
I'll describe in a moment.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.498 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to have an
interaction with your partner.

00:14:51.498 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to talk
about that for a little while.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
have another interaction,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.742 align:middle line:90%
a second one.

00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to discuss that one.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards, we're
going to come back and repeat

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:90%
what we just are about to do.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm talking
about by that,

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean the first thing I'm
going to ask you to do,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:84%
before you begin connecting
with your partner,

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is I am going to give
you three minutes

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:84%
to go in and connect with
the spirit of the earth,

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Earth.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And the best that you can,
whatever it means to you,

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
connect with her, and
feel connected, and begin

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with her.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:84%
At the end of those
three minutes,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I will have you come
back, and then we'll

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:90%
do these two exercises.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
After those two exercises,
we're going to repeat this.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
The reason is because
you'll find that these two

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:90%
exercises open your heart.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a lot of choice.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
If you really do this exercise,
it will open your heart.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, when you go
back and do the exercise where

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:84%
you go to connect with
Mother Earth a second time,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that it's usually
incredibly stronger and more

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
remarkable because you've opened
your heart relative to where

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:90%
you normally are.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're going to show

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:90%
you-- the power of love.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give
you three minutes

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
now, and in whatever way that
you know, go in and connect

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Earth.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
call you back out,

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:39.246 align:middle line:84%
kind of gauge how well you did,
the best you can for yourself.

00:16:39.246 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.326 align:middle line:90%
Now, here we go.

00:16:41.326 --> 00:16:46.862 align:middle line:84%
Just go in into the
earth and visit her.

00:16:46.862 --> 00:16:47.362 align:middle line:90%
[BEEP]

00:16:47.362 --> 00:16:47.862 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:16:47.862 --> 00:17:19.732 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.732 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, now come back, but
keep your eyes closed.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:90%
[BEEP]

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And just feel how well
that communication was.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.771 align:middle line:84%
And now, put your attention
on your partner with your eyes

00:17:35.771 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:90%
closed.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And to the best you can,
begin to sense your partner,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:84%
to feel their body and their
light body around them,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:90%
their aura, also.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Their thoughts, their feelings.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
See everything, sense everything
you can with your eyes

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.079 align:middle line:90%
closed first.

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, in just a moment,
I'm going to ask you

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.120 align:middle line:90%
to open your eyes in a minute.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, I'd like you
to look into your partner's eyes

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:90%
and just stare into their eyes.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And begin to look for that
sacred and holy person that

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:90%
exists in all of us.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to look
at their ego or anything

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:90%
you know about them.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:84%
You're going to look
past all of that.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And look to see if you can find
that sacred and holy person

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:90%
inside of them.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're looking for.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
About now, an interesting
thing begins to happen.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.865 align:middle line:84%
Your breath begins to
link with your partner,

00:18:39.865 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to
breathe in unison.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And also about now, if
you've noticed, even though

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
without looking-- and don't
look away from their eyes--

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:84%
but be aware that there
is a glowing light

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.736 align:middle line:90%
around their head.

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:90%
You can see it.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.785 align:middle line:84%
Almost everyone
here will see this.

00:19:01.785 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like you to
send a beam of light

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:84%
from your heart to their
heart, a couple inches around.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And make it this
beautiful pink color.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:19.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And feel the love for
them through that beam.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
light around their head

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:90%
when you did that?

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to ask you to do
an exercise within an exercise.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
If you can't do it,
do the best you can.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
If you can't do it,
then just revert back

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:90%
to what you're doing now.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But slowly cross your
eyes a little bit

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
until you can see four of
your partner's eyes, two sets.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Once you see the
four eyes, slowly,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
very slowly uncross
your eyes until two

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
of those eyes come back
and form a third eye,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:90%
one eye in the middle.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
When you see that third
eye, look into it.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:84%
For those of you
that are doing it,

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
you're probably feeling this
very strong, powerful energy

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.322 align:middle line:90%
in your own third eye.

00:20:17.322 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.795 align:middle line:84%
And you are linking
with this person

00:20:21.795 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:84%
in a very deep way, though you
may not know it at the moment.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.672 align:middle line:90%
Now, close your eyes.

00:20:29.672 --> 00:20:32.444 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.444 --> 00:20:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And give your partner a big hug.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:42.329 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.329 --> 00:20:43.245 align:middle line:90%
This is the easy part.

00:20:43.245 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, talk to your partner about
what you just experienced.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
There's one more thing
I just want to tell you

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:90%
while you're talking.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Probably 75% of
you or 80% of you

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
saw your partner's face
turn into other people.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.055 align:middle line:90%
Talk to them about that.

00:21:07.055 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.395 align:middle line:84%
OK, if we could focus
back up here now.

00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So don't go anywhere
because you're not

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.144 align:middle line:90%
done with your partner yet.

00:21:23.144 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do another one
in a minute, a second exercise.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Just to finish this one, though.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:84%
You began by first seeing your
partner with your eyes closed.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And how many people could
see their energy field

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and everything with
your eyes closed?

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of get
where we're at here.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
You can see a lot of things much
better with your eyes closed.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Really, you can.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then you
opened your eyes,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and you started looking
for that sacred space

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:90%
or person within them.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point,
I had you see the aura.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
the thought process

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:84%
because you're looking
around the head of what

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:90%
that person's doing.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.741 align:middle line:84%
How many people could see
that light around the head?

00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:19.705 align:middle line:90%
Looks like most of you.

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:90%
There's a little hole over here.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I had you
connect your heart

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to their heart with
a beam of pink light.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the light?

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:90%
She's going-- shoo.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:90%
It expands.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:90%
It gets bigger.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:84%
When you feel love coming from
someone, you respond with love.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, your aura
expands, it gets bigger.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It can get really huge
just by feeling that love.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Right after that, I
didn't say anything,

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.287 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure a lot
of you saw this.

00:22:58.287 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting there,
looking at the person,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.411 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, their
face goes-- [SOUND EFFECT]--

00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and morphs into a
completely different person.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:90%
How many people saw that?

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a lot of you.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it may morph into
another completely different

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
person, and then it could go
into five, or six, or seven

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And it could go from male to
female, and back and forth,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:90%
and different ones.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Also other kinds of life forms.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.550 align:middle line:84%
ETs will sometimes-- hey,
what are you doing out here?

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:90%
And even other animals.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:90%
How many people saw animals?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:90%
You saw him turn into an animal?

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:84%
These are what the natives
call power animals.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:84%
You have done a very
good deed to that animal

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
at some time in your
life, and they love you,

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:90%
and so they protect you.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And they stay with you.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.402 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a bad thing.

00:23:55.402 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good thing.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And then at the very end,
I had you cross your eyes

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
so you see four eyes, and then
move the two center ones in,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:90%
and you look into it.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:90%
How many could actually do that?

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.779 align:middle line:90%
Wow, very good.

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Usually, I only get about half.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:90%
That was like 75%.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:84%
That is a Tibetan practice,
and it is in their White Tantra

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It's actual sexual
energy you're feeling,

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's not sexual energy
that we normally think of.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I can't keep you
there very long.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:84%
When I first learned
that, I still

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:84%
can remember every
second of this.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:84%
When my wife and I
did this, and what

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84%
happens is when your
spirits link in that way,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:90%
it's a very sexual thing.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But you can't get apart after
a certain length of time.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:84%
If I left you there
for 20, 25 minutes,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.085 align:middle line:90%
the workshop would be over.

00:25:03.085 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:90%
That'd be it.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
We would just sit there
for the rest of the day.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
It takes about four,
five, six hours

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
before the two people
could break apart.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.295 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to.

00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't even push them apart.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:84%
You can push as
hard as you want.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Nothing will happen.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:90%
They're just like rocks.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:18.921 align:middle line:90%
They will not move.

00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And because they're
exchanging energy

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
on a very, very
deep level, I really

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.990 align:middle line:84%
think you'll know more--
you could have been

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
with your partner
for 20, 30 years,

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and you do that one
time, and you'll

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:84%
know them better than you've
ever known them before.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Because you're exchanging
from deep within them

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
all this just knowledge
and wisdom and energy,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of stuff.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
But it's beautiful.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:90%
But I had to stop it.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
If you do this at home,
when you get home,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
you might as well
just lock the doors,

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.544 align:middle line:84%
take all the telephones
off, everything else.

00:25:54.544 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get to the
certain place, you can't quit.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be a long time
before you can quit.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.226 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if the room burned
down, you'd just sit there.

00:26:02.226 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't go anywhere.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're going to
do another exercise.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And this one's going
to take you deeper.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go into
a little bit of psychic work

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
that some of you
might not be used to.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Just trust yourself.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.860 align:middle line:84%
You're more psychic
than you know.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And so this time, though,
instead of facing your partner,

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:90%
get back to back.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Before we begin, I'm going to
talk about the breathing tube,

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:90%
your Merkaba breathing tube.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
create another one.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
It won't be logical to you,
but just play the game.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's just a game.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, everything we're
doing, between now and the end,

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.888 align:middle line:84%
it works a lot better if
you're not serious about it.

00:27:00.888 --> 00:27:03.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Just don't care
about the results,

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and just be like a little
child and have fun.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the higher year
your degree in college,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.550 align:middle line:90%
the harder it is to do this.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:24.467 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got to get out of
your brain and into your heart.

00:27:24.467 --> 00:27:25.092 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:25.092 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, feel your
Merkaba rotating around you.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And feel the Prana coming
from above and below

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.300 align:middle line:90%
and meeting in your heart.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, also, this time,
be aware of the angel

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:90%
that you've met, down there.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.143 align:middle line:84%
I know some of you
probably already know

00:27:46.143 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:90%
that angel real well.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
But for some of you,
it's a new experience.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Let the angel guide
you or connect you

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:84%
through all of this,
this next step.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, just begin to breathe
through your Prana tube.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:11.862 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.862 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to give you a minute

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:90%
to breathe with your partner.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.242 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.242 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, about now, your breathing
begins to sync and go

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:90%
into unison with your partner.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself breathing in
unison with your partner.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, see, sense, or feel
a third breathing tube

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:90%
between your backs.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not yours or
your partner's.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:51.230 align:middle line:84%
It's an imaginary one,
put in between the middle.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.365 align:middle line:90%
Just be aware of it.

00:28:52.365 --> 00:28:55.979 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.979 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, your spirit
is not your body.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And your spirit is very
free in ways that many of us

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.010 align:middle line:90%
are not aware of.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And for once, just
allow this to be.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And feel your
spirit, or whatever

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:84%
you think your spirit is, begin
to move out of your breathing

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:84%
tube and back toward
the imaginary breathing

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:90%
tube between your backs.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And align yourself with
that breathing tube,

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:90%
and begin to breathe through it.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So your spirit is slightly
out of your body, partly in

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and partly out.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin to
breathe through this tube.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.225 align:middle line:84%
Now, realize both
you and your partner

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:59.030 align:middle line:84%
are breathing through the
same tube at the same time.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:90%
What does that feel like?

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.785 align:middle line:84%
You may not know
it at this moment,

00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:08.785 align:middle line:84%
but you are getting
very, very close.

00:30:08.785 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like you to send a
beam of light from your heart

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:84%
to theirs, and realize it's
diagonally across your body,

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.430 align:middle line:90%
your bodies.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Only this time, instead of
pink, make it a shimmering gold,

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:90%
and link your hearts.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.419 align:middle line:84%
And feel the love moving between
your bodies and your hearts.

00:30:27.419 --> 00:30:28.585 align:middle line:90%
And don't forget to breathe.

00:30:28.585 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like you to rotate on
the axis of that breathing tube

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.742 align:middle line:90%
and turn 180 degrees.

00:30:39.742 --> 00:30:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't care which way
you turn, left or right,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.390 align:middle line:90%
but rotate around.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:50.285 align:middle line:84%
And face in the direction
of your partner's body.

00:30:50.285 --> 00:30:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And now, either sense or
see or feel and look down

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:90%
into their body.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:90%


00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.295 align:middle line:90%
And continue to breathe.

00:31:02.295 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, with your
intention, you ask

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
their very innocent part
of them to come forth,

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:90%
the childlike part of them.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.960 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And ask that to come
up out of their body.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And connect with that
innocent part of them.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:84%
The moment you do, you
can feel everything.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.905 align:middle line:84%
You can feel everything that's
happened to them, all the pain

00:31:34.905 --> 00:31:38.134 align:middle line:84%
that they've gone through,
all the happiness and joy.

00:31:38.134 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Everything is open.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you're feeling
and seeing and sensing

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:49.100 align:middle line:84%
all of this about them,
a feeling very much,

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:84%
very often, comes up, and
it's a feeling of compassion.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it becomes clear,
as you're doing this,

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.200 align:middle line:90%
that you're just like them.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We all just want love and
comfort, to be taken care of.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's really simple things
that we really want.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And all the problems
that happen in our lives

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:09.909 align:middle line:90%
are just things that happen.

00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And they happen to
everyone, different degrees

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:15.670 align:middle line:90%
and different ways.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, very gently, give love
to that innocent part of them.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And let go, and
rotate back around,

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and face in the direction
of your own body.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
do it again, with you.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Look down into your
own body the same way

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.310 align:middle line:90%
you did with your partner.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:45.662 align:middle line:84%
And ask your innocent part, your
childlike part to come forth.

00:32:45.662 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:84%
When you feel it, when
you connect with it,

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.550 align:middle line:84%
go back in time, as
far back as you can go,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:90%
when you were a child or a baby.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And go back to a
happy moment that you

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.890 align:middle line:90%
had when you were little.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.518 align:middle line:90%
And that'll re-experience it.

00:33:13.518 --> 00:33:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, slowly come back
to your body, this room.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And be aware of
your breath again.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Feel the tube, and
realize that you're

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.305 align:middle line:90%
breathing with another person.

00:33:30.305 --> 00:33:33.155 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.155 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And you haven't
probably noticed it,

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.190 align:middle line:84%
but you have become incredibly
connected to this other person

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.580 align:middle line:90%
by doing this.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.606 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to know this,
in just a moment, because now,

00:33:45.606 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
you to come forth,

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.755 align:middle line:84%
to stop breathing
from that tube,

00:33:51.755 --> 00:33:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and go back into your
own body, and begin

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:57.875 align:middle line:84%
to breathe through your
own breathing tube.

00:33:57.875 --> 00:34:00.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to let go

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>So you began to-- you
moved back out of your body.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:84%
You began to breathe
with another person.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
At first, it just seems like
it's imaginary sort of stuff,

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:90%
usually for most people.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:58.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's real.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.910 align:middle line:90%
You really are.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to change
things inside of you.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So then, I asked
you to rotate around

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and face into the
other person's body

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and look down and
bring their childlike.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.070 align:middle line:84%
You can connect with various
parts of their consciousness,

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:84%
but that's a real
easy one and-- I

don't know exactly
how to say it,

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:84%
but it's just-- it's not
something that is fearful

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to accept that.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And so how many
people could do that?

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.020 align:middle line:90%
That's almost everybody.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:84%
When you did, how
many of you were then

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:53.320 align:middle line:84%
able to actually
feel everything that

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.680 align:middle line:84%
was going on inside
of their body

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and their experience,
their life, and everything?

00:36:01.915 --> 00:36:02.415 align:middle line:90%

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.510 align:middle line:84%
If you want to repeat
this at home, where you're

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.319 align:middle line:84%
safer and quiet, and everything,
you can get into a place

00:36:12.319 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:84%
where you could just
know everything.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're really just
wide open, at that moment,

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and you can know anything and
everything about that person.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:26.270 align:middle line:84%
You could probably really
accelerate therapy,

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.050 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, I had you turn
around and do it to yourself.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.660 align:middle line:84%
How many could do
it with their self?

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.370 align:middle line:84%
More could do it
with themselves.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.210 align:middle line:84%
It's usually hard to
do it with yourself

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and easier to do it
with someone else,

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:84%
than to look at your
own inner child.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, you went back
in time and experienced

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:84%
something that took place in
your life a long time ago,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:90%
hopefully a positive thing.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Could everybody do that?

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:90%

Then, there was an interesting
thing that happens,

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:84%
where I had you rotate-- well,
you had already rotated back,

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:84%
but then you had to separate
back into your own body.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.166 align:middle line:90%

Not connected, a lot
of things like that.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time
when we ran around

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.880 align:middle line:90%
in packs, basically, groups.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And we all knew how to do that.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And we were all
one living being.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.030 align:middle line:84%
They still do that,
a lot of tribes.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.030 align:middle line:84%
When you move around with
some of these tribes--

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I was just with a Kogi and
the Arhuacos in Colombia.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And they get so close that
they become totally telepathic.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And distance doesn't matter.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.469 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched them call in
people from all over the world.

00:38:10.469 --> 00:38:12.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't do anything, just
close their eyes, and bam,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.509 align:middle line:90%
they're all there.

00:38:13.509 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time when all of
us in our past used to do this.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.675 align:middle line:90%
And I think we miss it.

00:38:23.675 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Because now, we're just
on our little houses,

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.000 align:middle line:84%
our little boxes, and we're
separated from everything,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.360 align:middle line:90%
pretty much.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.330 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
different a long time ago.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.330 align:middle line:84%
The dolphins and the
whales are still like that.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.400 align:middle line:84%
We can actually
scientifically prove it,

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because we can see the
Merkaba fields around them.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
watch what's going on.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.590 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:48.554 align:middle line:84%
They usually choose the oldest
male, but not necessarily.

00:38:48.554 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they choose
the oldest female.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's not always
the oldest one, but just older.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And they choose one, and they
do exactly what we just did.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They all breathe through
the same-- they breathe

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.700 align:middle line:90%
through their breathing tube.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And it makes them all
cells in the larger body.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:09.005 align:middle line:84%
They all breathe
through one tube,

00:39:09.005 --> 00:39:10.255 align:middle line:90%
and they all become connected.

00:39:10.255 --> 00:39:13.050 align:middle line:90%


00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why you'll see
a whale beach themselves,

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.392 align:middle line:84%
and here's whales 20 miles
back, and they'll come in,

00:39:19.392 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:90%
and they'll beach themselves.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And they just keep
coming, because they're

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:84%
following this one being,
and they're so connected.

I mean, only you can
say that for yourself.

But we're trying to show
you that this is not a game.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:90%
The love is essential.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is the power
of the universe.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:90%
It's what drives everything.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.800 align:middle line:90%
It's what creates everything.

And so this is for sure.

00:41:04.147 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:84%
If it was something
else, we would go there.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.160 align:middle line:90%
But that is what it is.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And so everything we're going
for or toward is based in love.

It is the key to
higher consciousness.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Without the love, you
could never get there.

loving yourself.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with
my wife's work.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:84%

about her for a moment.

introducing this here.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.830 align:middle line:84%
She was sent there
by an organization.

of the oldest Jewish groups

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And she may not agree with
me, but I'm pretty clear.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.119 align:middle line:90%
She was sent as a spy.

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:49.690 align:middle line:84%
She had happened is, about 6,000
years ago, the Jews decided

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that they were
going to reintroduce

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:90%
the Merkaba to their community.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:43:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they hadn't used it
for, oh, about 60,000 years.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And the males were
the ones that did it,

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.430 align:middle line:90%
all the men in this tribe.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And they created
this Merkaba field.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't really know
how to do it very well,

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.710 align:middle line:90%
because it had been so long.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And they created a
situation very similar

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:22.280 align:middle line:84%
to the Philadelphia Experiment,
if you know about that.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.500 align:middle line:90%
They lost control of it.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.000 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them died.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were--
it was pretty horrible.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And when they got out of that,
the survivors of all of this

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.140 align:middle line:84%
came back and said,
wow, we just really

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.460 align:middle line:90%
don't know what we're doing.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.793 align:middle line:84%
They were the first ones to
ever write about the Merkaba

00:43:39.793 --> 00:43:42.560 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the women got
together, and they

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.720 align:middle line:84%
decided that what it was is
that they were emotionally not

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.750 align:middle line:84%
prepared, exactly what I
was talking about before.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You can't have all
this trauma in you

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and do these kind of an
interdimensional stuff.

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:58.793 align:middle line:90%
It just stops you.

00:43:58.793 --> 00:44:01.920 align:middle line:90%


00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.090 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just the trauma.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they hadn't
experienced fourth dimension

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:90%
in a very long time either.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So what the women
decided to do was

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:19.830 align:middle line:84%
to create a system to heal
the mental, emotional,

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and physical bodies.

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And even they realized that
it didn't have to be perfect.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.080 align:middle line:90%
It just had to be good.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It just couldn't be too far out
of balance in any one of them,

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.787 align:middle line:84%
or you can't-- I mean, if you're
just a totally broken up body,

00:44:33.787 --> 00:44:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a bed and tubes,
and you're unconscious, I mean,

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.710 align:middle line:84%
you've got a body, but it
doesn't do you much good.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And so emotionally,
there's a lot

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.190 align:middle line:90%
of people that are like that.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.898 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:44:43.898 --> 00:44:45.620 align:middle line:90%
But they're just like that.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.100 align:middle line:84%
They're on tubes in a
hospital, and they can barely

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.670 align:middle line:90%
keep it together.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And so they made
a system to heal,

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to bring, the emotional-- the
mental, emotional, and physical

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.620 align:middle line:84%
body together, and
also to prepare them

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.650 align:middle line:84%
for interdimensional experience,
because it's really unique.

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:02.350 align:middle line:90%
It's different than this.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Every different dimension
is completely and totally

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and absolutely and one
million percent different

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.770 align:middle line:90%
than the last one.

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:10.930 align:middle line:90%
And it takes a while.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Every time you enter
into one, you're a baby.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And you have to figure
everything out all over again.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.830 align:middle line:90%
And so they set up this school.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's been called
the School of Images,

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.820 align:middle line:84%
only-- Claudette calls
it the Blue School.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Because she has slightly
changed this school

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:31.670 align:middle line:90%
in her understanding.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And she's the only
Jew ever allowed--

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:38.530 align:middle line:84%
a person who is not a Jew,
ever allowed into the school.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:39.420 align:middle line:90%
She's not Jewish.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:40.390 align:middle line:90%
She's Polish.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't have
that lineage in here.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.207 align:middle line:84%
But the leader of
this, Colette, she

00:45:46.207 --> 00:45:51.230 align:middle line:84%
was 96 when she died,
about 10 years ago or so.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And somebody passed
a photograph of her.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And she stopped and said, that
person; you can let her in.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.800 align:middle line:90%
She can do this.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, that person actually
is changing the whole course

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.630 align:middle line:90%
of this, right now.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when she came
to me, the school

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:84%
sent her here to
learn the Merkaba,

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:84%
because they had--
after 6,000 years,

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:90%
the female side was intact.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.630 align:middle line:84%
They had that school
perfectly intact.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.795 align:middle line:84%
But the male side
of the Merkaba, they

00:46:26.795 --> 00:46:28.090 align:middle line:90%
had just completely lost it.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:29.567 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have it.

00:46:29.567 --> 00:46:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And so she was to come
there and learn the Merkaba

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and go back and tell
them how to do it.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:37.345 align:middle line:90%
But I took one look at her.

00:46:37.345 --> 00:46:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I fell in love with her
and brought her home.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.876 align:middle line:84%
And she's been
with me ever since.

00:46:40.876 --> 00:46:43.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And I still love her.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And she still has a
one-way ticket back.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.510 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And so what she changed in
that is that in all these 6,000

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:03.140 align:middle line:84%
years, it was always a
one-to-one person, the person

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.320 align:middle line:90%
doing the work and one person.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
work on one-to-one.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.994 align:middle line:84%
And Claudette said, well, I
think we can do this in groups.

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:11.910 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no, no.

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.330 align:middle line:84%
She says, well,
I'm going to do it.

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And so she went out all over, in
Argentina and Japan and Germany

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and places around the world,
and started doing this,

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.714 align:middle line:84%
and found a way that she
could take large groups--

00:47:27.714 --> 00:47:29.130 align:middle line:84%
they can't get too
large, but they

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.530 align:middle line:90%
can be this big; no problem.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And she can completely
track with that many people

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and move with their
emotional bodies

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and their physical bodies and
whatever their problems are.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:46.522 align:middle line:84%
And after about, I don't
know, five, six, seven years,

00:47:46.522 --> 00:47:48.230 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the school
was watching this.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
doing it, too,

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:52.260 align:middle line:84%
because they saw
that it was working.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, when she
went into Russia,

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:02.120 align:middle line:84%
she learned a great deal
more about how to work

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.710 align:middle line:90%
with large groups of people.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just tell you a
few things about the school.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.950 align:middle line:90%
And it took me forever.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was watching
what she was doing,

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.270 align:middle line:90%
it seems like magic.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:22.170 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like how could
you make these kind of changes

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.340 align:middle line:84%
so simply and in such
an easy way; just things

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.650 align:middle line:90%
that like a normal therapist.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:27.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she is a psychologist.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.880 align:middle line:84%
She has a degree,
and everything.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.900 align:middle line:90%
But she's never used it.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.570 align:middle line:90%
She's only used this.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But in normal therapy, it takes
forever to work this stuff out,

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.370 align:middle line:90%
usually.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And she can move through
years and years of what

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.540 align:middle line:90%
would be therapy, in just days.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And the person is
totally balanced.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But it begins with a completely
different view of the reality.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we think that all
the stars and planets are real,

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.220 align:middle line:84%
like I was saying before,
and all that other stuff.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.880 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't 6,000 years ago.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:04.840 align:middle line:84%
They never considered any of
this stuff actual or tangible

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.020 align:middle line:90%
that is real.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond them.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And their way of perceiving
it is that anything you

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:19.440 align:middle line:84%
are perceiving, no matter
how that image is coming to,

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.300 align:middle line:90%
is of equal value.

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking
at reality, it's

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.217 align:middle line:84%
no different than a
dream; or no different

00:49:29.217 --> 00:49:31.050 align:middle line:84%
than what happens if
you take a psychedelic,

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and you go into other
images moving in that way;

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.720 align:middle line:84%
or if you get a bump in the
head, and you go unconscious,

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and you have images
coming through that way.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.600 align:middle line:84%
However the images
are coming to you,

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.040 align:middle line:90%
they're of all the same value.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And they all have
meaning just as important

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.530 align:middle line:90%
as this world does.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And also another thing that
is hard for us to understand

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:58.100 align:middle line:84%
is that positive and negative
images have the same value.

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at an image
of someone killing somebody,

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at someone,
a mother holding the baby,

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.590 align:middle line:90%
one isn't better than the other.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:09.840 align:middle line:90%
They're the same value.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:84%
This goes beyond everything
we understand, at this point.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's how they
saw it, at those times.

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:19.689 align:middle line:84%
And that includes, I
just realized here,

00:50:19.689 --> 00:50:21.230 align:middle line:84%
even if you go into
other dimensions,

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, and you
see all this other stuff.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:25.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no difference.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just an image.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And they have two
different kinds of images.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.570 align:middle line:90%
One of them, we understand.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:37.330 align:middle line:84%
That's called guided imagery,
where you would take somebody--

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.350 align:middle line:84%
say, you'd tell them
to close your eyes.

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:40.750 align:middle line:90%
You're walking along a beach.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.450 align:middle line:84%
You see the waves,
see white clouds.

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're telling
them what to see.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And you're guiding them along.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.540 align:middle line:84%
They say, there are places
for that kind of work,

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:84%
but it's basically
at the bottom.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.470 align:middle line:84%
It's almost useless,
because you have

00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:00.960 align:middle line:84%
to get the imagery coming
within the person out,

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.626 align:middle line:90%
not what you're putting in.

00:51:03.626 --> 00:51:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
their own imagery.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
called translation imagery.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is a school that
is divided into, I think,

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.480 align:middle line:90%
it's six parts.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.920 align:middle line:84%
There's the school of
numbers; the school

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.940 align:middle line:84%
of form, which is
basically sacred geometry;

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:29.810 align:middle line:84%
the school of colors;
the school of images;

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.300 align:middle line:90%
the school of reversing.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I guess there's five schools.

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's schools
within the schools.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So within the school of
images, here's the reality.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:90%
We call it reality.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.030 align:middle line:90%
That's one school.

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
a school of dreams,

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and there's all these other
places that are in there.

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And they teach you how to
remember every single thing

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.970 align:middle line:84%
that happens all night
long, every word you said,

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:00.750 align:middle line:84%
everything that happened to
you for the entire night.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:04.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't imagine that you
can do that, but you can.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Because I was watching.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:07.260 align:middle line:84%
She used to have
individual students,

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and they would fax in
their night before dreams.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.049 align:middle line:84%
And here, you're getting
these-- every word.

00:52:13.049 --> 00:52:14.090 align:middle line:90%
It goes on and on and on.

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.570 align:middle line:90%
It was just amazing.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.296 align:middle line:84%
And you could
remember everything.

00:52:18.296 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know how
she teaches you to do that,

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.060 align:middle line:90%
but they do.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
Colette was still alive,

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and she was the
last living member

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:36.610 align:middle line:90%
of this tribe, the last one.

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And she was holding
on to that knowledge.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So it came down to one person,
just like the Hopi prophecy,

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:43.086 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:52:43.086 --> 00:52:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It would come down
to one person.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.920 align:middle line:84%
She was literally the
last one knowing this.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.641 align:middle line:84%
And she gave it to 12
people around the world.

00:52:49.641 --> 00:52:50.640 align:middle line:90%
My wife was one of them.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:90%


00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to
study with my wife.

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to understand
what she was doing.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I could see the
power in what she was doing.

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.631 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't-- it just
didn't make any kind of sense.

00:53:02.631 --> 00:53:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm logical, and
this is not logical.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.437 align:middle line:84%
And so I tried to
get it from her.

00:53:08.437 --> 00:53:09.770 align:middle line:90%
And I tried and tried and tried.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And I walked away, because I'm
never going to get it from her.

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.096 align:middle line:84%
And she's not interested
in telling me either.

00:53:14.096 --> 00:53:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:18.730 align:middle line:90%
She's [MAKES HESITANT NOISE].

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to her
teacher, Catherine Shainberg.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.290 align:middle line:84%
I went out there, and I studied
with her for a little bit.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And basically, she said,
you can't talk about this.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.430 align:middle line:90%
You can only experience it.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Talking doesn't do anything.

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I pushed
her, and she says,

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.720 align:middle line:84%
well, it's kind of like if you
think of the emotional body

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:43.780 align:middle line:84%
as something, you--
the way she was saying

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.590 align:middle line:90%
is you play tennis with it.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:49.740 align:middle line:84%
You put an image in,
and the emotional body

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:51.840 align:middle line:90%
will respond with another image.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you do,
once you see that image,

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.330 align:middle line:84%
then a communication
begins back and forth

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:59.820 align:middle line:84%
with images on a very deep
level within the person.

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you get back to
the source of the problem,

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:05.266 align:middle line:90%
you can completely change it.

00:54:05.266 --> 00:54:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And from their
point of view, you

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.000 align:middle line:84%
can heal any disease in the
world, either instantaneously

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.370 align:middle line:84%
or at anytime-- in any
time frame you wish.

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And they actually go
before the thing happened.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:22.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, I was over here,
at another conference center

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:26.590 align:middle line:90%
in Sedona, many years ago.

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And we had a break in
the middle of this.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And my wife was-- we were
teaching together at that time.

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's drinking coffee
and eating cookies, and things,

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.510 align:middle line:90%
and talking.

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And this one lady
came up who was blind.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.940 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't see.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And she'd been blind
for about 15 years ago.

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:48.020 align:middle line:90%
But she was about 30 years old.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.210 align:middle line:90%
And so we were talking to her.

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of it, I
don't know why I said it,

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I just said, how
did you get blind?

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.370 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:58.730 align:middle line:90%
And she made a joke out of it.

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:01.060 align:middle line:90%
She said some joke.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And it included her father.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And Claudette just looked at
me and says-- and took her over

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:09.950 align:middle line:90%
in the corner.

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And she started doing
imagery with her.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And she was there
for about 15 minutes.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
to someone else,

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.520 align:middle line:84%
but I was watching what
was going on there.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.985 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
this girl just screams.

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.225 align:middle line:90%
And she's, oh, my God.

00:55:23.225 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- she goes up.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Everybody turns around.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.450 align:middle line:90%
She goes, I can see.

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:29.060 align:middle line:90%
I can see.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out,
she ended up with 20/15.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:35.300 align:middle line:90%
She could see a fly on a tree.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It was perfect.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:40.400 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing ever
wrong with her eyes.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.355 align:middle line:84%
She shut them off because
of something her dad

00:55:42.355 --> 00:55:43.790 align:middle line:90%
did to her a long time ago.

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And she just didn't
want to see anymore.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And Claudette picked
that up instantly,

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:52.697 align:middle line:84%
went back to the time when that
happened, kept using the images

00:55:52.697 --> 00:55:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and going back further
and further until she

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:55.950 align:middle line:90%
got to where it was.

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, what they do is
they go five minutes before it

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.030 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And they take that
ima-- they change

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:08.329 align:middle line:84%
the image that your spirit
is accepting as reality.

00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And they throw it away,
and they replace it

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:15.280 align:middle line:84%
with another one that
is a more healthy one.

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, they bring
it forward in time

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and into the future, from
the time that they're

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.980 align:middle line:84%
doing that until it's at least--
first, three months and then

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.034 align:middle line:84%
six months, and I think,
nine months or something

00:56:25.034 --> 00:56:25.700 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.917 align:middle line:84%
They could see it's still
holding, and then let go.

00:56:28.917 --> 00:56:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, what happens, that
person goes [SOUND EFFECT],

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.420 align:middle line:90%
up to the present time.

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's gone.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And they no longer have
that problem anymore.

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.890 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't exist.

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:43.902 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I was there--
I couldn't figure it out

00:56:43.902 --> 00:56:46.110 align:middle line:84%
from Claudette's teacher
either, Catherine Shainberg.

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Israel,
and I went to Jerusalem.

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I went to this
lady's house, Colette,

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:56.410 align:middle line:84%
which they say Colette is a
very famous person in Israel.

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.625 align:middle line:90%
She was.

00:56:57.625 --> 00:57:00.000 align:middle line:84%
She was given the
highest award possible.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.630 align:middle line:84%
She was given an
award that-- the aware

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:07.490 align:middle line:84%
was the most beloved of
Israel in the last 500 years.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.790 align:middle line:90%
And she was a Moroccan Jew.

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And she just sat in her house
and never left her house.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:16.400 align:middle line:84%
She hadn't left her
house in 40 years.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And people, just a
steady stream of people,

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:22.130 align:middle line:84%
would come to her house to
get five minutes with her.

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Because in five minutes, she
could heal anything they had.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they would wait
four or five years

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to get that five minutes
with her, and come in there.

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:32.880 align:middle line:90%
But I wanted to see her.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And somebody just figured
it out and just brought me

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to our house and sat
me down next to her.

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how I
got in there, but I did.

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And she just looked
at me and kept going.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And as I was watching, there was
about 15 or 20 medical doctors

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.050 align:middle line:84%
there, and they were
all taking notes,

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:50.040 align:middle line:84%
because she had a way of--
that she was teaching them

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.460 align:middle line:84%
how to use this for
healing, physically.

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were getting patterns
from her in all different ways,

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:07.649 align:middle line:84%
But I just sat there
for two or three hours

00:58:07.649 --> 00:58:08.690 align:middle line:90%
while she was doing that.

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:09.550 align:middle line:90%
And I was just being polite.

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:10.425 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't interrupt.

00:58:10.425 --> 00:58:13.308 align:middle line:90%


00:58:13.308 --> 00:58:15.766 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, at one point,
she just, out of the blue,

00:58:15.766 --> 00:58:17.974 align:middle line:84%
she just turns to me, and
she goes, what do you want?

00:58:17.974 --> 00:58:20.090 align:middle line:90%


00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, I
have a question.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, what is it?

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And I says, well,
it's about reversing.

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought she
was going to kill me.

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:31.935 align:middle line:84%
She goes, well, what do--
how did you know about that?

00:58:31.935 --> 00:58:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And she was just
like-- I thought

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:35.980 align:middle line:84%
she was really going to get out
of her chair and come after me.

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And I says, well,
is that-- and I

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:39.330 align:middle line:90%
said I'd try to protect myself.

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:40.996 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, like
Catherine Shainberg

00:58:40.996 --> 00:58:43.650 align:middle line:90%
to-- naming the lineage down.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:47.000 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, oh, oh, OK.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.630 align:middle line:84%
She says, OK, you
came through the--

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and then she realized that I
was coming through the channels

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.829 align:middle line:84%
and not through some
other way, because I think

00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:56.120 align:middle line:84%
she would have picked me up
and thrown me on the street

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.260 align:middle line:90%
otherwise.

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:01.505 align:middle line:84%
She was a feisty little
lady, even in her 90s.

00:59:01.505 --> 00:59:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And then, I saw it in her face.

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:10.760 align:middle line:84%
She went, oh, like that, right
while she's talking to me.

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And she turns to the
group, and she goes, oh.

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a secrets part
of the school, and nobody

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.290 align:middle line:90%
knew about it.

00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:20.215 align:middle line:84%
And they're all going,
what's reversing?

00:59:20.215 --> 00:59:24.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.942 align:middle line:90%
And so she's, uh.

00:59:25.942 --> 00:59:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And so she had to
explain it to them.

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:29.775 align:middle line:90%
And she gave this example.

00:59:29.775 --> 00:59:32.450 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, you guys
know a certain such?

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And he was 27 or 28 years old.

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:37.775 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
yeah, we know him.

00:59:37.775 --> 00:59:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, he didn't
used to have a right arm.

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.610 align:middle line:90%
And they went, what?

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:43.780 align:middle line:90%
Because none of them knew that.

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:47.200 align:middle line:84%
His right arm was taken off
in an automobile accident

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.650 align:middle line:90%
and when he first came to me.

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And so after we taught
him to the certain level

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.910 align:middle line:84%
where you're at now,
we then brought him

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:56.710 align:middle line:90%
into the school of reversing.

00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And we went backwards
in time, to the place

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.480 align:middle line:84%
when the automobile accident
went in front of that,

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and then changed
the image, and then

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.340 align:middle line:90%
brought it forward in time.

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened is his
arm grew all the way back.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It took about a year,
but everything grew back

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:15.970 align:middle line:90%
perfectly normal.

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:19.056 align:middle line:84%
And she had it all documented
with videos, and everything.

01:00:19.056 --> 01:00:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And so these medical doctors
were, let me see this stuff.

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.180 align:middle line:90%
I got to see this.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Is this really real?

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:23.549 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:24.590 align:middle line:90%
They're all excited.

01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, she turns back
to me and says, OK, you.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.730 align:middle line:90%


01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to
know about reversing?

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
middle of something

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't want
to get involved in.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:38.020 align:middle line:90%
But I was involved in it.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:38.790 align:middle line:90%
I had no choice.

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was on a
global level, where

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I had learn certain things
that probably nobody on earth

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.400 align:middle line:90%
knows hardly.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.705 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
deal with these things.

01:00:52.705 --> 01:00:56.260 align:middle line:90%


01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that I
had been in two of them

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
at that time, two of these
global events, that were--

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.290 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to explain this.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.130 align:middle line:90%


01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:15.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like, the first one was
in-- I was in Switzerland,

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.920 align:middle line:90%
giving a class there.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, I drove through
Austria, over to Germany.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I got into
Germany, it was three days

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.634 align:middle line:90%
before the Kosovo War began.

01:01:24.634 --> 01:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And the angels came in
and said, well, there's

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
going to be a war started
here in three days.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to-- but it
isn't just an ordinary war.

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
It is a war that is
designed to bring

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.510 align:middle line:90%
the Arab world into jihad.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what the
whole purpose of that was.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was in
conjunction with Saddam.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's his name,
[Melanovich, or something--

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Melosovich.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Melisovich?

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The two of them, a lot of
the world doesn't know it,

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:57.357 align:middle line:90%
but they were best friends.

01:01:57.357 --> 01:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
They were really,
really good friends.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the entire
underground military system

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
that was in Iraq was
built by Melanovich.

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.579 align:middle line:90%
Did I-- How do you say it?

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Melosovich.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>How do you say it?

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:11.699 align:middle line:90%
>>Melosovich.

01:02:11.699 --> 01:02:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Melosovich?

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>You've got it.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Melosovich.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.770 align:middle line:90%
He built that for Saddam.

01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And they had planned together,
according to the angels,

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:22.080 align:middle line:84%
to create-- that's
why they were pushing

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
the women and the children and
killing the men, because they

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
were trying to get
NATO to attack.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted-- and
then, in the reverse,

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:36.950 align:middle line:84%
they were hoping that the Arab
world would just go full tilt

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and call for jihad.

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted
us to do something.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, what
am I supposed to do?

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.815 align:middle line:84%
And they says, well, you're
about to go into Germany

01:02:45.815 --> 01:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
with a group of--
and as it turned out,

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.640 align:middle line:90%
it was exactly 100 people.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And he says, that's not
an ordinary workshop.

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Those people had planned
this from a long time ago.

01:02:54.910 --> 01:03:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And their purpose is to stop
what it is about to happen.

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And they continued,
through the dream world,

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.910 align:middle line:84%
to show me all these different
things that was going on

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.570 align:middle line:90%
within these people.

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:12.295 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I got
there, I told them.

01:03:12.295 --> 01:03:12.965 align:middle line:90%
I just laid it on.

01:03:12.965 --> 01:03:14.090 align:middle line:90%
I just told them the truth.

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is--
you're not here for what

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.680 align:middle line:90%
you think you coming here for.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.272 align:middle line:84%
And they all says,
yeah, we know.

01:03:22.272 --> 01:03:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And I says, what do you know?

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.600 align:middle line:90%
And they says, well, we know.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Kosovo War
started the very day

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.710 align:middle line:90%
we started the workshop.

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And they knew.

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
They said, we-- and
they knew that this war

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
was designed and aimed
at the third world war.

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
stood up and said,

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
we started the Second
World War, but we're here

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:48.880 align:middle line:90%
to stop the third world war.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.620 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.940 align:middle line:90%
They went into a meditation.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And they all understood.

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Once I had given them the
parameters of how to do it,

01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.750 align:middle line:90%
they all went in.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And they went deep
into that level.

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
They just-- it was
pretty amazing.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
This huge sphere of light
appeared over the top of them

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and stayed there
for the whole time.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:15.035 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have a photographic,
because it seems like you'd

01:04:15.035 --> 01:04:15.910 align:middle line:90%
just photograph that.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It was just sitting here.

01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were gone for about
two hours, not moving a muscle.

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, simultaneously,
altogether, all 100 of them

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.370 align:middle line:84%
opened their eyes
within one second.

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
They went,
(CLICKING), like that.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
All of them said-- and they
all looked at each other.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.260 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.320 align:middle line:90%
And they knew it.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And it changed the
course of history.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.690 align:middle line:90%
And this happened.

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And it happened to me when
I was in Russia in 1999.

01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:52.744 align:middle line:84%
That's when the day that I
got there, Chechnya attacked.

01:04:52.744 --> 01:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And they blew up this
huge building in Moscow.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember, about 300
people were killed?

01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And the angels came
in immediately,

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
and they told me it was
Chechnya right at that point.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that's
what's going on.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's Saddam, again, who
was friends with that country

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:11.010 align:middle line:90%
and the one next door.

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And during that workshop, the
king of that country next door,

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was, invited
me to his palace.

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And when he's sitting
there, he shows

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
me a picture of him and
Saddam, with their arms

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:23.730 align:middle line:90%
around each other.

01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And I already knew what
was going on in that level.

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that's again
what they were trying to do.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to get
Russia to come in and attack

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that country, hoping this little
hopeless Arab country would--

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.910 align:middle line:90%
the rest of them would do jihad.

01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:46.660 align:middle line:90%
But this was really interesting.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.800 align:middle line:84%
During the break in
all of this, the angels

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:56.880 align:middle line:84%
had me call in Russians
to do this meditation.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.980 align:middle line:90%
300 people showed up.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they were all in
this huge auditorium.

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:06.784 align:middle line:84%
And I started talking
to them, telling them

01:06:06.784 --> 01:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
what we were there for
and what they're doing.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And they seemed to know also,
not like the Germans did,

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
but they just had
a "we understand."

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:21.596 align:middle line:84%
And one of them says, we
want to discuss this first.

01:06:21.596 --> 01:06:23.210 align:middle line:90%
And I says, OK.

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it was, about a
third of them were Jewish,

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:28.510 align:middle line:84%
about a third of them were
Christian, and about a third

01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
of them were Muslim;
and what a discussion.

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were screaming
at each other, ah,

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:39.129 align:middle line:90%
you Jews and you Muslims.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And the Christians,
they were saying,

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:42.221 align:middle line:84%
were all involved
in pornography.

01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And you were doing this.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
on and on and on.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.630 align:middle line:90%
They were screaming.

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I just sat
down and watched this.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And it went on for,
ppfff, a long time.

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I really don't
know; over an hour.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the guy
who was helping me,

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Tom De Winter, who
is from Holland,

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:04.060 align:middle line:84%
but he works with the Russians,
he says, he immediately says,

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.690 align:middle line:90%
I think you've lost the group.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And I says, no, just wait,
and see what happens.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
they got done.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
bit of quietness.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And somebody stands up and
says, OK, let's do this.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400 align:middle line:90%
And they all hold hands.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.634 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:21.634 --> 01:07:23.482 align:middle line:90%


01:07:23.482 --> 01:07:24.870 align:middle line:90%
And I go, wow.

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And they closed their
eyes, and they're

01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:30.400 align:middle line:84%
gone, just like the Germans,
for an hour or longer.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
It was an hour and
a half, at least.

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, this big, white
sphere of light formed.

01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:35.472 align:middle line:90%
It took longer.

01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It took about a half an hour.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.110 align:middle line:90%
But it formed above them.

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.270 align:middle line:90%
They went in total unity.

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what was
going on in their minds

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.730 align:middle line:90%
or in their hearts.

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:47.827 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it was, when they'd
done, the same thing happened.

01:07:47.827 --> 01:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
They all just opened
their eyes all at once.

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And and they were--
felt absolutely

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.570 align:middle line:84%
that what they had done
was going to-- that

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
we would not go into
a third world war.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.860 align:middle line:90%
And it never developed into one.

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
through 19 of these.

01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
There's 19 places in the
Torah, 19 secret places,

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.356 align:middle line:84%
where it describes this
and that we're going

01:08:11.356 --> 01:08:12.480 align:middle line:90%
to go through these places.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And if any one of them
were to break down,

01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:16.569 align:middle line:84%
it would be the end
of life on Earth.

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But and I don't know
where we're now.

01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
We're probably at number
15, or something like that.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of
things secretly going on

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.770 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:31.263 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we'll come
to number 19, at which point,

01:08:31.263 --> 01:08:31.804 align:middle line:90%
we transcend.

01:08:31.804 --> 01:08:35.279 align:middle line:90%


01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And so this way
of being, this way

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of what they call reversing,
in the Hebrew world,

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.330 align:middle line:90%
is-- it's real.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very real.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.432 align:middle line:90%
>>I'll stand up.

01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
because in the Nassim Haramein

01:08:54.640 --> 01:09:01.569 align:middle line:84%
mind is doing a teaching
about reversing,

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:08.340 align:middle line:84%
explaining in terms of geometry
and space-time coordinates.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.475 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you change to
geometry, when you go backwards

01:09:11.475 --> 01:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and to the point
you had the problem,

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.649 align:middle line:84%
you changed the
information there.

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And the old geometry
backwards changes forward,

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:24.149 align:middle line:90%
changes up to the present.

01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Thinking of it in terms
of geometry, what happens

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:29.609 align:middle line:84%
is there are only
certain places where

01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
you can make those changes,
certain very precise times,

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.689 align:middle line:84%
and geological locations on
the earth simultaneously.

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, at that moment,
you can do something.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.988 align:middle line:84%
Any other time, you
can't do anything.

01:09:44.988 --> 01:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I really like
what he's doing.

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I was just on a BBS
television, or radio,

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was,
with him recently.

01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:55.550 align:middle line:90%
And I like his work.

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I like what he's doing, and
I like where he's going.

01:09:57.930 --> 01:10:01.532 align:middle line:84%
And it's very good
work he's doing.

01:10:01.532 --> 01:10:06.430 align:middle line:90%


01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Reversing is something I'd
also like you to do tonight.

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
When you go home,
you have homework.

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:18.550 align:middle line:90%


01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is to write
the word reversing

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and put it on your
table by your bed,

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.030 align:middle line:84%
so that you'll remember when
you wake up in the morning.

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
in, take this day.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
But this day may
not be the best one,

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
but it's the only one
we've got, right now.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And take this day, and after
you've brushed your teeth

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're in bed and
you're ready to go to sleep,

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
then take the day
and go backwards.

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
walking backwards.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.930 align:middle line:84%
You go in, and you
scan through the day

01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to find something
that didn't feel good,

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
something that somebody
said to you or something,

01:10:58.670 --> 01:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%
or who knows what.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have anything,
you don't have anything.

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.088 align:middle line:84%
You just scan through
until you find something.

01:11:03.088 --> 01:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
If you don't find
anything, then it's OK.

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But this shouldn't take more
than a minute, where you just

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:11.530 align:middle line:84%
scan the entire day;
but going backwards.

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:13.070 align:middle line:90%
It does not work going forwards.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:15.930 align:middle line:90%
You have to be in reverse.

01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you get
to some place-- let's

01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:19.630 align:middle line:90%
just use an example.

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You get somewhere, and somebody
said something dumb to you,

01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it hurt your feelings,
or something like that;

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.890 align:middle line:90%
or maybe worse.

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
You come to that, and you
do exactly what I say.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Then go five minutes
before it happened.

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:37.489 align:middle line:84%
And in your own mind,
change it to a way

01:11:37.489 --> 01:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
that you would have liked
to have seen it happen.

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:42.160 align:middle line:90%


01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you
see that image of how

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
you would like to
see it happen, then

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:51.890 align:middle line:84%
look 30 days into
the future and feel

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
that it is still holding, that
the image still works there.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And then go another time.

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
They have different feelings
about how intense something is.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have to
go further, but usually,

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.990 align:middle line:84%
at least two months
or three months

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
into the future, that you can
see that it's still there.

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you
have done that,

01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:19.550 align:middle line:84%
then stop, and keep going back,
reversing, until you either

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:22.100 align:middle line:84%
find another one or you get
back to when you woke up.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.980 align:middle line:90%


01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:31.430 align:middle line:84%
According to this
way of understanding,

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
you not only change
yourself, but you change

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.700 align:middle line:90%
the image with the person.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
They won't even remember,
if you really do it.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
You literally are
changing reality.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.160 align:middle line:90%
And so just try it.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
valuable tool, and you

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:56.736 align:middle line:90%
can use it as much as you want.

01:12:56.736 --> 01:12:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But once you understand
it, you can apply it

01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:02.070 align:middle line:84%
to what happened a month
ago or 10 years ago

01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
or when you were born, or even
back into other past lives,

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:07.580 align:middle line:90%
if you want to.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.620 align:middle line:90%
You can alter anything.

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Because from their
way of seeing,

01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:12.430 align:middle line:90%
there is no linear time.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:15.030 align:middle line:90%
There just is images.

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And you change the images,
and you change everything.

01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
We have a very
specific understanding.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And we think that what our
way of perceiving today

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:28.540 align:middle line:84%
is what everybody
used to think of.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.230 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't true.

01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
We have changed many
times over the past.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.657 align:middle line:84%
So often, we go
into archaeology,

01:13:35.657 --> 01:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and you go into these
ancient temples, and things.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.330 align:middle line:90%
And people look at it.

01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And they apply their
modern day thinking

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
to try to interpret
what that is.

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't work,
because the people who

01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
did that were in another world,
have a totally different belief

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.370 align:middle line:84%
pattern, and everything
and understanding.

01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do that.

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, a lot of
times, they fake it.

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:59.120 align:middle line:84%
I was in Peru once,
at Machu Picchu.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And I remember there's
a big stone there.

01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was all done
doing what I was doing.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking at it
thinking, what is that?

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to understand it.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make any sense.

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And this archaeologist
came with a group.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And he stopped, and he
was speaking English.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And he gave them this
explanation of what it was.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And I went, wow, that
makes so much sense.

01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Now I understand.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they left, and
I was thinking, god,

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:24.790 align:middle line:90%
that's really fantastic.

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
They did this and that,
and that's what happened.

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:29.149 align:middle line:84%
And then, another
one came along.

01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he was going
to tell them the same thing.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.231 align:middle line:84%
And he told them a
totally different thing.

01:14:33.231 --> 01:14:33.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.450 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even--
completely different.

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.036 align:middle line:90%
But it was really good.

01:14:39.036 --> 01:14:40.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.100 align:middle line:90%
I says, OK.

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.987 align:middle line:90%
One of these is true, but maybe.

01:14:44.987 --> 01:14:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe neither one
of them are true.

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:50.005 align:middle line:84%
But definitely one
of them is wrong.

01:14:50.005 --> 01:14:51.880 align:middle line:84%
But that was just
when I was beginning.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But later, I
realized this, once I

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
got into more and
more ancient ruins.

01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
We've changed over
and over and over.

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And we're about to change again.

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:05.535 align:middle line:84%
Where if we looked at humanity
just two or three, four years

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:10.150 align:middle line:84%
from now, our belief patterns
are going to be so different,

01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that anything that we did
now, if you looked at it,

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:18.175 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't make any sense with
who we will be in the future.

01:15:18.175 --> 01:15:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And so if we came back--
if somebody else came back

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.619 align:middle line:84%
in later, with the
kind of thinking

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that we had in the future, and
try to apply to that to who we

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.120 align:middle line:90%
are now, it won't work.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
We're doing things deeply
from polarity thinking.

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
We judge everything
that takes place,

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and we do it all from that.

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:56.134 align:middle line:90%
