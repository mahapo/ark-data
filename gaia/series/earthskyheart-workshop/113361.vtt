00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.692 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.692 --> 00:00:02.845 align:middle line:90%
>>Day 4 is the day of the heart.

00:00:02.845 --> 00:00:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.160 align:middle line:90%
It's working.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.510 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.910 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.260 align:middle line:90%
The day of the heart.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Finally, we made it.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:90%
This is day 4.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I really like how
straight and-- all these rows

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:90%
are perfect.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to move
all the chairs-- [LAUGHS]

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.645 align:middle line:90%
--in a minute, in just a second.

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
begin with a dance.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:90%
It's called a Sufi dance.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's about a
700-year-old dance.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's not really a dance.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a meditation.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you dance
and you're moving,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's a moving
meditation is what it is.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Sufis did this
every single morning

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:90%
in their khanqahs.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:84%
A khanqah is like a
monastery or an ashram.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And every morning,
they would do this,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:84%
because it was the essence of
what they were trying to learn.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And by doing it every
morning, it changes you.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:90%
It is a very powerful thing.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And so in a moment,
we'll do that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And that takes a while.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:84%
By the time you get
started and finish,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:90%
it makes almost an hour.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
After that, we will begin.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:90%
But let's just do this.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's just start here.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.498 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
The reason I do this is that
it is so powerful putting you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people end up
crying a lot, can't help it,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.567 align:middle line:90%
especially if you're a crier.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
If you are a crier, just fill
your pockets with Kleenex,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.483 align:middle line:84%
because you know
it's going to happen.

00:01:53.483 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll pass them around.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.157 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if we can
get 127 people in a circle.

00:02:01.157 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try it.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
work, then I'm going

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:90%
to have to go to two circles.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But first, we'll try that
and see how it works.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can just take the chairs
and put them up here, I think.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Just stack them.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Start stacking them.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Use all the space you can.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.779 align:middle line:84%
Just see that there's about
6 feet all the way around.

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:90%
That's all we need.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Here's what we're going to do.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:84%
This is faster if I just do it,
because I've tried it before.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.194 align:middle line:84%
And if you guys do it,
it takes twice as long.

00:02:48.194 --> 00:02:49.121 align:middle line:90%
>>Dance for us.

00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm going to just
say you're number one.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:90%
You're number two.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And number two, come
into the inner circle

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:90%
and face him that way.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
So you're one.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.225 align:middle line:90%
And you're two.

00:02:57.225 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:90%
And you're one.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.785 align:middle line:90%
And you're two.

00:02:58.785 --> 00:02:59.285 align:middle line:90%
And one.

00:02:59.285 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And two.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:90%
One and two.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:90%
One and two.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:90%
One and two.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:90%
We are even again.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:90%
We're a very even group.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Now try to space yourselves
so that you have room.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.300 align:middle line:90%
It goes left to right.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody have a partner?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Say yes.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.769 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.685 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:90%
I know you guys like each other.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But I need your
attention up here.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.941 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the way
it's going to work.

00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Is Diane here?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.061 align:middle line:90%
>>I am.

00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Come here so I can
show everybody.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And I hope everybody can see.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:90%
This is how it begins.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
with one person here.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
hugging this person.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:90%
This is the very end.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
We're going from the
end to the beginning.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:90%
And you're hugging this person.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to hear
these bells go ding.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And it then means
that you have to break

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
your hug, which is really
hard, because-- you'll

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:90%
understand a little.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But you get so close to
these people that it's hard.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.435 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, you have
to break the hug.

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:90%
You bow to them.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And you take a step to the left.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And now you have a
brand new person.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:84%
When you meet that
person, you bow to them.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:84%
You honor the divine
light within them.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you give
them your right hand

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and let them place it
over their heart chakra.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin to
look into their eyes.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.159 align:middle line:84%
And I can't talk if I'm
looking into your eyes.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's do it this way, because
there are others [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.199 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:90%
So you bow.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
You give them your right
hand and let them place it

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:90%
over their heart chakra.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin to
look into their eyes.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the
same thing that you

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
did on the first day, where you
look into the person's eyes.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And you look past
their personality.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And you look for that sacred
being that is within them.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Only now you're going to be
looking through many people.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And it does something
entirely different.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing what
happens in this.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And so you have 60 seconds.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually timing it
with a little clock.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to think about that.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And in those 60 seconds, you
just find that sacred place

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:90%
within them.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And what's so interesting
is that you'll

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
realize that as you go
from person to person,

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:90%
it's always the same.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not a different energy.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the same exact
energy in everyone.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacred place.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And so at the end of
60 seconds, you're

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:90%
going to sing them a song.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And the words to the song
are, "You are my beloved.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.900 align:middle line:90%
I open my heart to you."

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But you're not opening to the
ego or to the personality.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
You're opening your heart to
that sacred being within them.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:84%
It's really different than--
it's not just a person.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You're really going
straight to the source.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you sing them a
song, "You are my beloved.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:90%
I open my heart to you."

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:90%
And it goes like this.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.373 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) You are my beloved.

00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I open my heart to you.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And you have their
hand on your heart

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:90%
and your hand on their heart.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And so what you do is
when you open your heart,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
you feel your love go down
your arm and into their heart.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And you feel their love
come back from them to you.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:90%
And you feel this connection.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:90%
We hold that for 20 seconds.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%
You're just doing
it for a little bit.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And you feel that connection.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And then after
another 20 seconds--

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
it's a very simple thing--
and then hug that person.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.362 align:middle line:90%
They'll just say, hug.

00:07:02.362 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And you just give them a hug.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's also for 20 seconds.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
you'll hear the bells.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:90%
And you have to break the hug.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to
break this hug sometimes.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you've just connected
with a sacred being.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.297 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it.

00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Where's the Kleenex?

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.158 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Diane will distribute this.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.706 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
one or two boxes?

00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
If you know you're going to
cry, just go ahead and do it.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:84%
If you think you even
might want to cry, do it.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:90%
When you need it, you need it.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is important.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:84%
This was traditionally always
done in absolute silence.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a meditation.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:84%
It's actually in
the physical heart.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:90%
It's inside the physical heart.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The chakra is connected
directly to it.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a direct relationship
between the heart chakra

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:90%
and the tiny space in the heart.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:90%
But it is not exactly the same.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:90%
We're going to sing the song.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:90%
So you know it.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:90%
So I'll sing it one more time.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And then you come after that.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.793 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) You are my beloved.

00:08:08.793 --> 00:08:13.271 align:middle line:90%
I open my heart to you.

00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.838 align:middle line:90%
Let's all do it.

00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:19.718 align:middle line:90%
>>(SINGING) You are my beloved.

00:08:19.718 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:90%

>>You just sing it one time.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you actually
feel the love go down.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it come back.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:37.581 align:middle line:84%
And I'll lead you through it
for at least two or three times.

00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
And then after
that, you'll get it.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:90%
You'll know what to do.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Now turn around.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and start the music.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes first.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And remember your Merkaba
and the flow of energy

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.105 align:middle line:90%
coming into your heart chakra.

from the first day.

Feel her or him.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Feel that angel within
you and all around you.

OK.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Bow to your partner, honoring
the divine light within them.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And hand them your right hand.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And let them place
it over your heart.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And now look into their eyes and
find that sacred and holy place

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:90%
within them.

And then eventually,
all of this is

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
going to lead into a
meditation toward the end

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:84%
of the day, where we actually
go into the sacred space

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:90%
of our heart.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.557 align:middle line:84%

feel that they know how

00:16:02.557 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and they've been into their
sacred space of their heart?

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
It's approximately
51 out of 127.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:90%
So we've got a lot of work.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We probably will get most people
before the end of the day.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And there will be
a few of you that

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:90%
still won't be able to get in.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to program now.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But there will
probably be a few.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when
you get home and you're

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.579 align:middle line:84%
in the safety of your own place
and you can repeat what's done,

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:90%
then you find you can do it.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But there is a thing which
is the emotional trauma.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just talk about
that just for a second.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.310 align:middle line:84%
If you can't get
in, most often, it's

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:84%
because you've had an emotional
trauma centered around love

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that was so deep that when
you begin to move back

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.925 align:middle line:84%
into the heart, it either
hurts or it feels cold

00:17:41.925 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:84%
or it's something that
makes you back away.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I've discovered
is if you're brave enough

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and if you can go
through it, you're

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:90%
fine once you get in there.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything's OK.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you can't,
and you keep trying

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and you still have
that same feeling,

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that you can
do is to go through therapy

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and find out what that was
and to release that pain.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Then it's easy.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But there is
another thing, which

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
is not having to do
with trauma at all,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:84%
but having to do with-- there's
a specific vibration that

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.622 align:middle line:90%
must be within you.

00:18:34.622 --> 00:18:35.955 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about this later.

00:18:35.955 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
the way that you

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:90%
connect with the outer reality.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have to do this
in a certain kind of way.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, you're
wasting your time.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But we will clearly
explain what it

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:84%
is, what you have to do to
get that vibration within you.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.004 align:middle line:84%
But so often, people
hear it, they do it here.

00:18:59.004 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And then they go home.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.545 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't think
it was important.

00:19:01.545 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And they just forget it.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But when I get to that point,
I'll be very clear on that.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it is another
one of the reasons why

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:14.580 align:middle line:84%
if you don't follow one of the
instructions, there's nothing

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:90%
you can do.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
you do, you can't get in.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
But we'll work with that
when we get to there.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But in your physical heart,
there is a tiny, little place.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It's so small that I don't know
if you can actually see it,

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:90%
it's so little.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And science has been
trying to find it,

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:84%
especially HeartMath
at Stanford has been

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:90%
spending years working on this.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:90%
They know the vibration.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
They actually have an
instrument that you can buy.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:84%
You push your finger
on the button.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in your
heart, it'll say so.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not-- it gives you
a red light or a green light.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And it tells you if
you're in or not.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a very specific frequency.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:84%
It's actually more
than a frequency.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a waveform.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
beautiful waveform

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:90%
when you see it on a screen.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And so science is
slowly getting there.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
They've never been
able to figure out--

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and they know it's
true-- they've never

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
been able to figure out how it's
related to the pineal gland.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship
between this and the heart.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And they know that for sure
because of their experiments.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But they have never been
able to figure out--

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I haven't talked to them
for two or three years.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.671 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know for sure.

00:20:47.671 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
But they've never been able
to figure out what it is.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And they've checked every single
possible electrical connection

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
within the body, and
they can't find it.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The reason, I believe, is
because it's not in the body.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It's external to the body.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And we'll explain that,
too, once we understand

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:90%
what we're having to say.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of information
around the heart that

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:90%
is kind of important to know.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
know it to do this,

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're entering
the heart from a female way.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:84%
If you do it from a female
way, you just do it.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:90%
You just do it.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.494 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing
it from a male way,

00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:28.785 align:middle line:90%
you've got to know the doorway.

00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to know
exactly how to get in there.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:90%
It's male, right?

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to know
the instructions.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:90%
So we will talk to the male way.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:90%
But there is the female way.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.385 align:middle line:84%
I would love to have my
wife come here today.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if she will or not.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I never know about her.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.810 align:middle line:90%
She is her own woman.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But she doesn't use any
of the stuff that I do.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.763 align:middle line:90%
It's all imagery.

00:21:57.763 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what she uses.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:84%
There has been almost nothing
written about this in history.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
It's all been oral and oral
traditions all over the world.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
As far as I know,
there's only been--

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:84%
let me see, two-- three books
written-- well, if you count

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:90%
my book, I guess four books.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But without that, there's only
been three books written ever

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:90%
about this sacred space.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.576 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.576 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to say
what's the oldest one.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Probably the oldest
one is with the Torah.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Many Jews don't
know that there's

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:90%
a separate book to the Torah.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little, tiny book.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:54.093 align:middle line:84%
And it's named the secret
cavern, or cave, of the heart.

00:22:54.093 --> 00:22:56.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think at least
half or more of the Jews

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:90%
don't know it exists.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it's bound separately
in this little, tiny thing.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to get one
of those and understand it.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:90%
I've tried.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.785 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to two or three
rabbis-- yeah, that there.

00:23:13.785 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Can I have a copy?

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Sure, of course.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:90%
But I never get it.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, yeah,
I've got one at home.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Can I have it?

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Sure, I'll give you one.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.852 align:middle line:90%
But I never get it.

00:23:27.852 --> 00:23:29.435 align:middle line:84%
And it's just because
it's too sacred.

00:23:29.435 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:90%
And I understand.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.090 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's another one in
India called the Upanishads.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And that book I
remember a long time

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:84%
ago in the '60s, early '60s,
when I became interested

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
in spirituality, I started
reading spiritual books.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up reading every
single book in this store

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:90%
that I was in.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And I began to realize they
were all saying the same thing.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with different slants.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's all the same thing
over and over and over and over.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But when I came to the
Upanishads, I read that.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading it and
going-- I got all through it.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And I put it down and
just kind of looked at it

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:90%
and went, what is that?

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It didn't fit into
anything else.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.800 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
else that approached

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:90%
or that it was similar to.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.232 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't know
what they were talking about.

00:24:31.232 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know till
many, many, many years

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.660 align:middle line:84%
later, where I had
direct experience myself.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when I reread
that book many years later,

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:90%
it makes perfect sense.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just 108 people--
just like you and me,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:84%
no different, human
beings-- who found

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:84%
their way into
their heart and then

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:90%
wrote down their experience.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:58.075 align:middle line:84%
And so it's 108 people saying,
this is what happened to me,

00:24:58.075 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:84%
this is what happened to me,
this is what happened to me.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of similarities

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:90%
running through it.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So after you've
been into the heart

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and you really become more
familiar to it, read that book.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:90%
And it'll make total sense.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it'll be
the same experiences

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that you're having, only
they might have ones

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:90%
you haven't had yet.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.376 align:middle line:84%
Or this this one might
have ones you have had.

00:25:19.376 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:90%
But you'll see.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an important
book on the subject.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:84%
There was a modern day book that
was written about 20 years ago

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:90%
out of New Zealand.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's from the Waitaha tribe.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They are one of the oldest
tribes in the world.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
They go back about
roughly 160,000 years.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And they remember going
back 65,000 years.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.319 align:middle line:90%
I am Waitaha now.

00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I've been through
all the ceremonies.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And they-- it takes a long time.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It takes three days just to
go through the ceremonies.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm now legally a Waitaha.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.162 align:middle line:84%
So I can talk
about these things.

00:25:56.162 --> 00:25:57.370 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And they can remember
their lineage

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:84%
going back 65,000 years,
which was at the end point

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:90%
when Lemuria sank.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:90%
They came from Lemuria.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And in their
ceremonies, the elders

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
can repeat their entire
names of all their lineage.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
It takes days, and
especially since the names

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.692 align:middle line:90%
are from here to the wall.

00:26:22.692 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have little names.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.577 align:middle line:90%
They have long names.

00:26:25.577 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So they can remember their
mother and their father

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and their grandfather
and their grandmother

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.423 align:middle line:84%
and their great-grandfather
and their great-grandmother.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps going
back 65,000 years.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're product in to
some of their sacred temples,

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:84%
you can see on the walls
all their memories,

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:90%
if you can read it.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about how they
used to live in the water.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't have a spine.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:90%
It was all more like cartilage.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:90%
They were more like a fish.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And right on the
walls, you can see

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
they have webbed
hands and webbed feet.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.290 align:middle line:90%
They weren't very tall.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
They were probably
maybe only this high.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were incredibly
sexual beings.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their entire focus on
life was on sex, just about.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.090 align:middle line:90%
That was everything to them.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And they had very
interesting relationships

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:84%
in what they believed sexual
energy was to other tribes

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that are farther north, like in
Finland and in the Netherlands

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and up in there-- there are
ancient ideas from them that

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:84%
aren't talked about
in modern day times.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But their relationship
was almost identical.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:90%
And they feel a relationship.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:90%
They feel this kinship within.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
New Zealanders feel

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:90%
that they are related somehow.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what all
that is about exactly.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But they wrote a book called
"The Song of the Waitaha."

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can't buy it, unless
you're in New Zealand.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Maybe somewhere.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a big, white book, heavy.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And they put in there
their understandings

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
of the heart and
the dreaming and how

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:90%
the dreaming becomes real.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.402 align:middle line:84%
And they could change their
world through their dreams.

00:28:32.402 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And to us, dreams
are just dreams.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But what most of us
don't know is that we

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.810 align:middle line:90%
have two dreaming bodies.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
We have one dreaming
body associated

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.750 align:middle line:90%
with our right brain.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.405 align:middle line:84%
And we have another dreaming
body associated with our heart.

00:28:48.405 --> 00:28:51.135 align:middle line:84%
The dreaming body from our
right brain is polarized.

00:28:51.135 --> 00:28:52.885 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
can have a good dream,

00:28:52.885 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
or you can have a
really bad dream.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:90%
You can have nightmares.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
dreams that are

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.490 align:middle line:84%
totally separate and
individual, completely different

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:84%
dreaming body associated
with the heart, that

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.470 align:middle line:84%
never has a negative--
it's not polarized.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So it has no-- you can't have
a bad dream from the heart.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It only makes good dreams.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Or it could make a neutral
dream, but nothing that

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:90%
would be considered negative.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.320 align:middle line:84%
If you think you're
in your heart

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're having
a negative image,

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.076 align:middle line:90%
you're not in your heart.

00:29:27.076 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
You're just in your brain
imagining you're in your heart.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.930 align:middle line:90%
Because it just won't happen.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
very little that has

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:44.420 align:middle line:84%
been talked about throughout
the world on this subject.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:90%
It's always been oral.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:90%
And they would tell people.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But they would
never write it down.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:84%
It was just considered too
sacred to even write down.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
you write it down,

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
some people will
misunderstand it.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's always problems
in those kind of ways.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what I feel, anyway.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about
the ascension being

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:84%
just a movement from the
brain back to the heart again.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And really, after
all the study I've

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:84%
had on this in my whole
life, it's really all it is.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.450 align:middle line:90%
You can make it complex.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.237 align:middle line:84%
You could say, OK,
ascension is spaceships

00:30:38.237 --> 00:30:40.070 align:middle line:84%
coming down and getting
on and they take you

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
into other dimensions
and all these kinds

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of ideas with the Ashtar
Command and on and on and on.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
But really, really,
really, it is just

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.410 align:middle line:84%
returning back to the
heart, where we fell,

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.507 align:middle line:90%
where we came up here.

00:30:53.507 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:90%
And we're just going back there.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And once you're
there, that's it.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.690 align:middle line:90%
It's it.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.575 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're still
completely in your human body

00:31:03.575 --> 00:31:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and you're in your
job and you're

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.210 align:middle line:84%
doing everything else
like that, ascension

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
has reached its most
important point as soon

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:90%
as you return back to the heart.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart will lead
you through everything else.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.860 align:middle line:90%
But it will bring you back.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.470 align:middle line:84%
If there is a
spaceship involved,

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.236 align:middle line:84%
it will come to
you, whatever it is.

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to
do anything after that.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you've found that, all
the rest of it is automatic.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've received this
information primarily

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:90%
from indigenous people.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Because they're the only ones
who remember what this is.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:54.740 align:middle line:84%
The industrial world, regardless
of the color of your skin

00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:84%
or where you're from or
what your religion is,

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:84%
if you're living
with televisions

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and cars and this
industrial world

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and you've accepted it
into your life, most of us

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.260 align:middle line:84%
have completely
forgotten the heart.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know we have one.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.870 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And where I find the truth
is out in the jungles

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.397 align:middle line:84%
and in these high
deserts and places

00:32:24.397 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:84%
where there are
indigenous people that

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.330 align:middle line:90%
are still living this truth.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.106 align:middle line:84%
It's so amazing, just
like right now-- we

00:32:32.106 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:84%
were hugging each
other and everything.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And you were
beginning to feel what

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.910 align:middle line:90%
it's like to be in a tribe.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Because in a tribe there's
no-- well, a lot of the tribes

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
have been corrupted, like the
relationship between the Navajo

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:90%
and the Hopi here in Arizona.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:84%
There's been lots of trauma
that have happened to them.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you go out in places
where they've completely

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.490 align:middle line:84%
isolated from the world, it's
a different thing altogether.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Once they allow
you into the tribe,

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.320 align:middle line:84%
you're just like with
a bunch of children.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.950 align:middle line:90%
They're so easy.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Their hearts just
leap over to you.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't get those kind
of experiences very much.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.670 align:middle line:84%
You had a little bit of
it just a few minutes ago.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But just imagine in
your entire world

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:28.230 align:middle line:84%
living like that, where
everybody loves everybody,

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and there's hardly
any problems at all--

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.080 align:middle line:90%
occasionally, but not much.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.000 align:middle line:90%
And so that's where I found it.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was the Kogi
and Arahuacos in Colombia

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.100 align:middle line:90%
that really did it for me.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I was beginning to understand
it a little bit before that.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until I
met them that I really

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
began to understand the nature
of what we were talking about.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Studying the Merkaba and
sacred geometry and even

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:84%
the beams of light and all this
other stuff, that's one thing.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:90%
But the heart is another world.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's another totally secret,
other way of existing.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just love.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.590 align:middle line:84%
It's much, much, much,
much more than that.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:28.159 align:middle line:84%
And so communicating it
to the industrial world,

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:90%
it's not easy.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't make a
straightforward translation.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And there are no
words you can use.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try to use a few.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:39.402 align:middle line:84%
But it all comes
down to experience.

00:34:39.402 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:90%
It's experiential.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.985 align:middle line:90%
It's touch.

00:34:41.985 --> 00:34:43.120 align:middle line:90%
It's feel.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:90%
It's feeling it.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk about it.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.630 align:middle line:90%
You can talk about it forever.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't do anything
until you actually

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.429 align:middle line:84%
get into the actual experience
of what the heart is.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:35:00.721 align:middle line:90%


00:35:00.721 --> 00:35:01.673 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:01.673 --> 00:35:02.173 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:35:02.173 --> 00:35:05.580 align:middle line:90%


00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>When you say that once
you get in your heart,

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:12.490 align:middle line:84%
then it's very easy-- can
you talk more about that?

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:84%
That once we go there,
ascension can seem complicated.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:90%
But once we go there, it's--

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.051 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I am slowly
going to do that.

00:35:21.051 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:84%
But I would really like you
to get the experience more

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:23.883 align:middle line:90%
than anything.

00:35:23.883 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I probably won't have
to say much for most of you.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But ascension comes down to--
and this is what the Mayans

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and the Hopi and the
Kogi and Arahuacos,

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:38.140 align:middle line:84%
all of them are saying, even the
Zulu in Africa and the Waitaha

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and the Maori and
the [? Kuna ?]--

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I think almost all tribes
will agree with this--

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.220 align:middle line:84%
is that it's so simple, it's too
simple for me to tell you right

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I have to wait
till we have a little bit

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:90%
more experience.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And then at the right moment,
I will say this really simple

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:00.880 align:middle line:90%
thing to do.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, you've
just won the game of life.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:11.280 align:middle line:84%
You're a totally safe-- you
absolutely will go all the way.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But I can't say it
now, because it's

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.410 align:middle line:90%
too-- you won't believe it.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.610 align:middle line:90%
It's too easy.

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.735 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll have to go
a little bit further.

00:36:20.735 --> 00:36:23.231 align:middle line:90%


00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about darkness.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.960 align:middle line:90%


00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:34.590 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland uses
two eyes to see with.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And your eyes can't see
unless there's light.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You have to have light,
or you can't see.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:84%
If it's totally darkness,
you're blind and you can't see.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.610 align:middle line:84%
With your heart, it
is the exact opposite.

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The heart requires
darkness to see.

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:58.270 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a strange thing
when you really think about it.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Light interferes with being
able to see with the heart.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:84%
You can learn how to be in
your heart and see in light.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.030 align:middle line:90%
But you have to learn how.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:90%
It takes a little bit.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:15.350 align:middle line:84%
The super psychic kids
all over the world,

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.830 align:middle line:84%
they basically do
everything they

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:90%
can to get rid of the light.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.137 align:middle line:84%
Some of them put tissue
crammed inside of here

00:37:24.137 --> 00:37:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and things wrapped around and
everything else like that.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And people think that
they're cheating and looking

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.380 align:middle line:84%
underneath and everything,
when, in fact, they're trying

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.700 align:middle line:90%
to get it as dark as possible.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Because once they go into total
darkness, then this shuts down.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it's very, very
easy to move into the heart,

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.150 align:middle line:90%
because it sees with darkness.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you enter
into the heart,

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.460 align:middle line:84%
it's always black,
just totally black.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And you then have to
ask for the light.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.850 align:middle line:84%
You have to use intention
to get the light.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you do, the
darkness becomes a light field.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And you can see in it.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:14.820 align:middle line:84%
However, the heart isn't quite
as straightforward as this.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
In this with the eyes, you
have all kinds of light

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.270 align:middle line:90%
that you can see with.

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But in the heart, when you ask
for light-- which you must do--

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:33.910 align:middle line:84%
but when you ask for light, it's
hard to say what kind of light

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get back.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.955 align:middle line:90%
It might be daylight.

00:38:36.955 --> 00:38:40.470 align:middle line:84%
It might be white, like
this kind of light.

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.350 align:middle line:90%
It could be like moonlight.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:90%
It could be psychedelic light.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
get that, too,

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:51.625 align:middle line:84%
where just the colors are
incredible and vibrant

00:38:51.625 --> 00:38:52.250 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:56.260 align:middle line:90%


00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:04.687 align:middle line:84%
And the light may come on
anything you can imagine.

00:39:04.687 --> 00:39:06.270 align:middle line:84%
It might come on
like a dimmer switch.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.850 align:middle line:84%
You ask for it, and
nothing happens.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And it comes on very,
very, very slow, so

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:14.410 align:middle line:84%
slow that you don't even
realize it's happened.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember I had--
several people, actually--

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:84%
but this one guy, though,
I remember he was going,

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.769 align:middle line:90%
light never came on.

00:39:26.769 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
talking to him, he says,

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:84%
it just stayed absolutely
black the entire time.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I kind of
got bored with it.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
chair sitting there.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So I went over and I
sat down in the chair.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:90%
And then I said, wait a minute.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.750 align:middle line:90%
How did you see the chair?

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:90%
And he went, I don't know.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.020 align:middle line:90%
And that happens all the time.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.565 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it'll just
come on so slow.

00:39:54.565 --> 00:39:56.812 align:middle line:84%
And it might take 15
minutes to come on

00:39:56.812 --> 00:39:58.020 align:middle line:90%
and you don't even notice it.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're actually
seeing, but you're still

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.490 align:middle line:84%
thinking you're in the
darkness when you're not.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I've seen
that many times.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.104 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
it'll come on.

00:40:11.104 --> 00:40:12.020 align:middle line:90%
And then it'll go off.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.436 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll
come back on later.

00:40:13.436 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:90%
And it'll come back on.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And it'll do all
kinds of things.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
ask for the light

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.970 align:middle line:84%
and then just accept
whatever happens.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.210 align:middle line:90%
And just go with it.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:90%
It's between you and God.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And God will give you
the source of life.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Literally-- well,
it's everywhere--

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:84%
but the source of
life is very vibrant

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and can communicate with you
totally in the sacred space

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.247 align:middle line:84%
It's not even easy to do it in
the outer space of the heart.

00:40:45.247 --> 00:40:47.580 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about-- there are
two different spaces of it.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But the inner space of the
heart, God is always there.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.415 align:middle line:84%
And you can connect
directly with the source.

00:40:55.415 --> 00:40:59.370 align:middle line:90%


00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:00.990 align:middle line:90%
But we'll get into that.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:07.948 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sort of opening
the door on all of this.

00:41:07.948 --> 00:41:13.020 align:middle line:84%
But this darkness is an
important part of all of it.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Also, the light, when you
receive it through the eyes,

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:84%
it goes into a brain
that is polarized.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And so your light is coming
from somewhere to somewhere.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.775 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
you can make a shadow.

00:41:28.775 --> 00:41:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But in the heart, it's a
different kind of light.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a non-polarized light.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not coming from
anywhere, going anywhere.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything just is light,
and not the kind of light

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.030 align:middle line:90%
that we normally think of.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what's interesting is
you cannot throw a shadow inside

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:84%
of there, because
there's no polarization.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways-- it's
not an absolute foolproof way,

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:84%
because the mind is pretty
tricky, the ego-- but sometimes

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:03.940 align:middle line:90%
I do that.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's, am I really-- yep.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:90%
No shadows.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.740 align:middle line:90%


00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The inner space of the heart
can look a lot like this.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:90%
But you'll see the difference.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
everything just is light.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:20.610 align:middle line:90%
And it just glows.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
primary reason why

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.640 align:middle line:90%
we've given you the blindfolds.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.690 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
an essential tool.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
sitting here like this,

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and even if there's just
like an exit sign in there,

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:84%
it affects the being able
to shut down the brain

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and making it easier
to get into the heart.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.610 align:middle line:84%
But once you've done it,
once you know how to do it

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and you go back and
forth a few times,

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.490 align:middle line:84%
then you can get to
the place where you're

00:42:55.490 --> 00:43:00.770 align:middle line:84%
doing what I'm doing right now,
where I'm totally in the brain,

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.070 align:middle line:84%
but not in a way most
people are in their brain.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my heart.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually sitting
cross-legged right now

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:90%
in some sand in a little place.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's where my essence is.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned how to be there
and also look through here.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while
to do that one.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:28.870 align:middle line:90%
But we'll slowly get there.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know I've written--
how many people have not read

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.450 align:middle line:90%
the book, Living in the Heart?

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:40.910 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four, five.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.060 align:middle line:90%
A few of you.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of you have
read all this stuff.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.865 align:middle line:90%
And you can go into it.

00:43:47.865 --> 00:43:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But basically, I was
led through this.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just give
you a real quick sense

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.340 align:middle line:90%
of the history of this.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I was meditating
doing the Merkaba meditation

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought that's all
there was in the beginning.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know there
was more to this.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any idea
of all this stuff we're

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.767 align:middle line:90%
starting to talk about then.

00:44:12.767 --> 00:44:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But I would do the
meditation, which usually

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.766 align:middle line:84%
takes about four and a half
minutes for most people,

00:44:16.766 --> 00:44:17.730 align:middle line:90%
or five minutes.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I would go for
usually a half an hour,

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:21.855 align:middle line:90%
45 minutes longer.

00:44:21.855 --> 00:44:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I would just sit in
the energy and feel it.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was
just sitting there

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:31.230 align:middle line:84%
meditating in the
darkness and just feeling

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.090 align:middle line:90%
the flow of energy.

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, bam, like a light
switch, I was inside of a cave.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote about
it in the book.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was the weirdest feeling,
because I was in my body.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure
out what happened I

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:90%
had no idea what had happened.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I just thought I was
having a hallucination,

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.610 align:middle line:84%
except that when I would
go up to the walls,

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.720 align:middle line:90%
I could touch the walls.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And they just felt
exactly like this.

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was really,
really confused.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking
around and looking at things

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.150 align:middle line:90%
and going, what is going on?

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.030 align:middle line:90%
What is happening to me?

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And then as quickly
as I came-- [SNAPS]

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting back in my
body meditating again.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember getting out
of that thinking, that

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:23.775 align:middle line:90%
was a very weird experience.

00:45:23.775 --> 00:45:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.299 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of felt like maybe
some wires got shorted out

00:45:31.299 --> 00:45:32.340 align:middle line:90%
in my brain or something.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what happened.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.250 align:middle line:90%


00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And if it had never
happened again,

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I would have completely
forgotten about it by now.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But then a few days
later, it happened again.

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
happening every single time

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:90%
I went into my meditation.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.420 align:middle line:90%
I would end up in this cave.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And the angels weren't
saying anything.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.981 align:middle line:84%
They were just
sitting there watching

00:45:51.981 --> 00:45:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to see how I'd respond
to this, I think.

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if he has a complete
breakdown or what happens.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:02.125 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.125 --> 00:46:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, well, I'm going
to study while I'm in here.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm here all the time.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I've got to figure
out what this is.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And there were-- I
call them photographs.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
really photographs.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to explain
what they are.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:14.960 align:middle line:90%
They were etched into the wall.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.710 align:middle line:90%
But they really looked real.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But they were 20 of these
photographs of people

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:23.082 align:middle line:90%
on one side of the wall.

00:46:23.082 --> 00:46:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never seen
them in my life.

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.970 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who they were.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this
little round circle of sand

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.840 align:middle line:90%
back there with a lip.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Everything was like one piece.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.980 align:middle line:84%
You could see where
somebody had chipped it out.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:84%
But the whole cave
was like one piece.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:40.517 align:middle line:90%
And this lip came up.

00:46:40.517 --> 00:46:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was a circle.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's this white,
soft, silicon sand in there.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know what that was.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.060 align:middle line:84%
There was another
thing over here,

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.210 align:middle line:84%
which was a big kind of an
opening of about 20 feet or so.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.600 align:middle line:90%
It was real high.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And it had a sheet of
light running down it.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.167 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't see
into the light.

00:46:56.167 --> 00:46:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't put my hand
through it or anything.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.720 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't allow me to.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.230 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't know what that was.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.646 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
farther end, there

00:47:02.646 --> 00:47:07.710 align:middle line:84%
was a staircase that spiraled
down to another level.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And later I found out--
the light up in here

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.150 align:middle line:84%
was kind of a whitish light--
but when I went down in there,

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:16.190 align:middle line:90%
it turned into a green light.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.355 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
doors, a hallway

00:47:18.355 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:90%
with lots of doors and doors.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't know
what those things were.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I was so confused.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what was going on.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.845 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly-- this
went over many years.

00:47:31.845 --> 00:47:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I hit the Kogi

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that I understood what
had been going on,

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.240 align:middle line:84%
really understood what had
been going on all these years.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And they're experts.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:46.450 align:middle line:90%
They really are.

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And they live in caves
almost all the time, too.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.680 align:middle line:90%
That's their whole thing.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.610 align:middle line:84%
It's inside the Earth is
where they do almost all

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.370 align:middle line:90%
of their work.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
it began for me.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when the Kogi did
this thing with me, really,

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:15.100 align:middle line:84%
through the Mayans,
they sent a runner to me

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.040 align:middle line:90%
with a little gift.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.550 align:middle line:90%


00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted
to say thank you.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And then so the
runner said, this

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.750 align:middle line:84%
is from the Kogi
and the Arahuacos

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And they're saying thank you.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was going--
well, first of all, I'd

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:middle line:90%
never heard of them before.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I was saying, this is a
tribe I don't even know about.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So why are they
saying thank you?

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Mamos-- there's
a tribe within a tribe.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Bigger tribe is
about 14,000 people.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:53.370 align:middle line:90%
The Mamos are about 200 people.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And the outer tribe
looks at the inner tribe

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:04.760 align:middle line:84%
as-- they see them
almost on the same par

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.260 align:middle line:90%
as we would see god, in a way.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.660 align:middle line:84%
The Mamos, what they are
is direct manifestations

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.804 align:middle line:84%
directly from Mother Earth,
the spirit of the Earth.

00:49:15.804 --> 00:49:16.970 align:middle line:90%
They are directly connected.

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.660 align:middle line:90%
They call her Aluna.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.085 align:middle line:90%
And they are one with her.

00:49:20.085 --> 00:49:22.870 align:middle line:90%


00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the Mamos, they
did things with me

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:84%
that are considered
normally impossible.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.760 align:middle line:84%
They literally just
would make a sound,

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and I would disappear from
one area where I was with them

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and reappear somewhere
else in one second.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never
had this happen to you,

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:55.237 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty unusual.

00:49:55.237 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:84%
The feeling is just like--
[POPS MOUTH] All of a sudden,

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:57.990 align:middle line:90%
you're here.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.406 align:middle line:84%
And then-- [POPS MOUTH] You're
on the other side of Sedona

00:50:00.406 --> 00:50:02.170 align:middle line:90%
somewhere, or something else.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.020 align:middle line:90%
It changes you.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.650 align:middle line:90%
It has a big effect on you.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It did on me.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It would have on
anyone, I think.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Were you in meditation
or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>No, I was not in
meditation at all.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:13.770 align:middle line:90%
I was just standing there.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.465 align:middle line:90%
They did this quite a few times.

00:50:15.465 --> 00:50:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:84%
They understand that we're
walking around in a dream

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and that it's just
pure consciousness.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And so because they
understand this,

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:30.480 align:middle line:84%
they know how to do things
that-- they understand

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the reality which
we do not understand at all.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
they can do anything.

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:36.180 align:middle line:90%
They can change shape.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.835 align:middle line:90%
They can change form.

00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:38.710 align:middle line:90%
They can do anything.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:41.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty amazing.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, by far, the
indigenous people

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.540 align:middle line:84%
have had major impacts on me
in understanding this and being

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.990 align:middle line:84%
able to bring it to
you in a coherent way.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.600 align:middle line:10%
But there has also been others.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And the psychic children that
originated out of China, then

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.720 align:middle line:84%
went to Mexico and then
South America and then

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Bulgaria and Russia,
and they started

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.190 align:middle line:84%
showing up all over the
world, these children

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.790 align:middle line:90%
have also blown my mind.

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's all they do, is they
just go into total darkness,

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:17.810 align:middle line:90%
go into their heart.

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And in your heart is the Akashic
records of all life everywhere.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.910 align:middle line:90%
We mentioned that before.

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:24.600 align:middle line:90%
But they can read it and see it.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they can take any
one of you-- never seen you

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:32.160 align:middle line:84%
before in your life-- and
tell you anything about you.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.220 align:middle line:84%
They can tell you
anything, anything at all,

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.040 align:middle line:90%
things you don't even remember.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:41.830 align:middle line:84%
They can tell you exactly dumb
things, like your bank account

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.330 align:middle line:84%
number and precisely how much
money you have in your account

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:45.450 align:middle line:90%
to the penny.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:46.860 align:middle line:90%
They never make an error, ever.

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen them even
make one mistake ever.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's perfect.

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And we have that same ability.

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:56.200 align:middle line:90%
We can do that, too.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.640 align:middle line:90%
You can do that, too.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.150 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be part
of the unfoldment

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:06.100 align:middle line:84%
when you remember what the heart
is and your connection to it.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:10.600 align:middle line:84%
That in there is all knowledge,
all wisdom, everything-- past,

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.330 align:middle line:90%
present, and future.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And these children are
able to go in there

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.035 align:middle line:84%
and enter into that space
and be able to do this.

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
them do it, it's

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:23.090 align:middle line:84%
hard to believe they
can do this when

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.130 align:middle line:90%
you're watching them do it.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:27.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.572 align:middle line:90%
It is definitely true.

00:52:29.572 --> 00:52:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are millions
of these children.

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Though most of them are
hidden and very quiet,

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.220 align:middle line:90%
there are really a lot of them.

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.220 align:middle line:84%
They're different than
the Indigo or the Crystal

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.100 align:middle line:90%
kids or these things.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They're totally different.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:48.850 align:middle line:84%
The Indigo kids, primarily
their connection to each other

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:50.240 align:middle line:90%
is more psychic.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.955 align:middle line:84%
And their connection is
through computers a lot.

00:52:53.955 --> 00:52:56.746 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.746 --> 00:52:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's
unfolding through there

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.120 align:middle line:84%
is primarily coming
from the Indigo kids.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But the psychic kids
have the same thing,

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.670 align:middle line:84%
only it's internal
instead of external.

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.000 align:middle line:84%
They close their eyes,
and they see a screen.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And on that screen is
little screens that

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:15.250 align:middle line:84%
are going around it that are
moving at really high speed.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:20.200 align:middle line:84%
You've got to really get
into it to slow yourself down

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.070 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see those things.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But from there,
just the same way,

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.450 align:middle line:84%
they could know
anything from that.

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And most of these Indigo
kids are from 1972, forward.

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But there were a few
that came in earlier.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I was one.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But there are a
lot of other ones.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Mary Ann Schinfield
was another one.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.110 align:middle line:90%
I met her in 1990.

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:47.522 align:middle line:90%
And she's totally blind.

00:53:47.522 --> 00:53:48.480 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned her before.

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.730 align:middle line:90%
She has no eyes.

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But she can drive cars and read
books and watch television.

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And you'd never know,
but she has no eyes.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But her body is-- she
is one who lives--

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.170 align:middle line:84%
she's floating around the
solar system all the time.

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:05.695 align:middle line:84%
She's the one I said about
when NASA found her and made

00:54:05.695 --> 00:54:08.730 align:middle line:84%
her go along on the satellites
and read the serial number

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:10.720 align:middle line:90%
on this thing.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know what she's
doing, pretty much.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:20.515 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.515 --> 00:54:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how she does this.

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But she's interfaced
right in the middle

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.340 align:middle line:84%
between the fourth dimension
and third dimension.

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:29.700 align:middle line:84%
If she turns this way, behind
her is the fourth dimension

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and in front of her is
the third dimension.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And she's really incredible,
what she can and cannot do.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:40.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>The Indigo kids and
the super psychic kids,

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:53.220 align:middle line:84%
they are from humanity or from
an extraterrestrial region?

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>There may be
exceptions that come

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:00.030 align:middle line:84%
from humanity that have died
and come back as an Indigo kid.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But almost all of them are from
space-- and not just space,

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.880 align:middle line:90%
but other dimensions.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.712 align:middle line:84%
They're from much
higher consciousness.

00:55:08.712 --> 00:55:09.676 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:55:09.676 --> 00:55:12.570 align:middle line:90%


00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:15.659 align:middle line:84%
>>And again, this is why
there are so many people here.

00:55:15.659 --> 00:55:16.950 align:middle line:90%
This has never happened before.

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We've never had 7
billion people on Earth.

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.499 align:middle line:90%


00:55:21.499 --> 00:55:22.790 align:middle line:90%
They're coming from everywhere.

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:23.664 align:middle line:90%
They want to be here.

00:55:23.664 --> 00:55:26.780 align:middle line:90%


00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could go
on and on and on.

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell this story
about Oscar Mendoza,

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:34.640 align:middle line:90%
because it's not in the book.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:40.600 align:middle line:90%
But I did mention Inge Bardor.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.520 align:middle line:84%
She was one of the
super psychic kids.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.211 align:middle line:84%
Her and my wife
are really close.

00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:46.710 align:middle line:84%
They're always
talking all the time.

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And she was talking
a couple weeks ago.

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Inge is one of the
Mexican super psychic kids

00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.930 align:middle line:84%
that we did that video on,
Through the Eyes of a Child,

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:05.062 align:middle line:84%
where, before, 600
people in Denver-- she

00:56:05.062 --> 00:56:08.670 align:middle line:84%
was blindfolded and
was able to read

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:11.760 align:middle line:84%
with her hands and her feet and
show all these different kinds

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.620 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I wanted her to float
like a big, heavy rock

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.220 align:middle line:84%
around the room, which
she can do, easily.

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.190 align:middle line:90%
And her mentor was there.

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:23.710 align:middle line:90%
And her mother was there.

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And they just freaked
out-- you can't

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.290 align:middle line:90%
do that, you will not do that.

00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Because their worry was that
when Inge went back to Mexico,

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:37.590 align:middle line:84%
anybody doing psychic
things like that

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:40.980 align:middle line:90%
are considered evil in Mexico.

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.440 align:middle line:90%
And they'll kill you.

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And so she was seeing
with her hands and feet.

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:50.070 align:middle line:84%
They weren't too
worried about that.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But they were really concerned
about doing something obvious,

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:56.770 align:middle line:84%
like floating a rock
around the room.

00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:57.775 align:middle line:90%
So it never happened.

00:56:57.775 --> 00:57:00.270 align:middle line:90%
It's too bad.

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But we were at one time--
I mentioned in the book

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.710 align:middle line:90%
about these two guys.

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of them--
she was sitting.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.052 align:middle line:90%
And she was blindfolded.

00:57:18.052 --> 00:57:19.635 align:middle line:84%
And she was looking
at the photographs

00:57:19.635 --> 00:57:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and telling what was
in the photographs.

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you guys remember that?

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was one guy
that came in and said,

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe you.

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:31.800 align:middle line:90%
You're looking underneath here.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so she had to do this
whole thing to convince him.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.616 align:middle line:84%
And even after she was
reading everything,

00:57:37.616 --> 00:57:38.740 align:middle line:90%
he still didn't believe it.

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one that
brought up his driver's license

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and handed it up to her,
handed it to her upside

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:43.857 align:middle line:90%
down and backwards.

00:57:43.857 --> 00:57:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And she immediately turned
it over, did this whole thing

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:49.970 align:middle line:84%
like that, and read the whole
thing on the driver's license.

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:51.690 align:middle line:90%
That's your driver's license.

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to her,
I still don't believe you.

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Tell me something
that only I know.

00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:58.506 align:middle line:84%
And remember, that
was the one who

00:57:58.506 --> 00:58:01.970 align:middle line:90%
was there with his girlfriend.

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:03.790 align:middle line:90%
And she's really mischievous.

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:08.047 align:middle line:84%
So she goes, OK,
well, what you know

00:58:08.047 --> 00:58:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and your girlfriend
doesn't know is that you

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.730 align:middle line:90%
have another girlfriend.

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And her name is, "da-da-da,"
and something like that.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was just
blown away by this.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:20.420 align:middle line:90%


00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And so after that,
where there was a break

00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and he was standing over
by a big plate glass window

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.200 align:middle line:84%
looking up at the sky
and he was kind of,

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.740 align:middle line:84%
I guess, embarrassed
and not feeling good--

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and she knows exactly
what he's feeling

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:38.120 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.430 align:middle line:90%
And she saw his sadness.

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And so she went over to
him and said, you know,

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:43.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm really sorry.

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mean to
hurt you like that.

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And he says, oh, that's OK.

00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said to him, I
want to give you a gift.

00:58:55.940 --> 00:59:00.060 align:middle line:90%
And he said, OK, what is it?

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And she says, you see that
big cloud up in the sky?

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:06.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a big billowing,
white cloud like that.

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.500 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I want to show you so
you know for sure, absolutely

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.805 align:middle line:90%
for sure that this is real.

00:59:12.805 --> 00:59:15.320 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And he says, what
are you going to do?

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:22.645 align:middle line:84%
She goes-- [SMACKS LIPS]
--this is a laser gun.

00:59:22.645 --> 00:59:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to cut
the cloud in half.

00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And she goes-- [SWOOSH] and
the cloud was cut right in half

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.530 align:middle line:90%
in a perfect line like that.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, cut
it the other way.

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:30.970 align:middle line:90%
[SMACKS TONGUE]

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Four sections cut
perfectly in half

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:37.420 align:middle line:84%
with a straight line right
down the middle like that.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And he saw that happen.

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:42.140 align:middle line:84%
That's usually an
illegal thing to do.

00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.240 align:middle line:90%
But she did it.

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was instantaneously
transformed.

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:53.370 align:middle line:84%
He went from a skeptic
to an absolute believer.

00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:55.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up teaching
the flower of life

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.720 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And he became one of the
greatest facilitators down

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.740 align:middle line:84%
there, because he knew for
sure what he was talking about

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.450 align:middle line:90%
was really real.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I figured I'd just
tell you that little story.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.070 align:middle line:90%


01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So there have been many people
that have led up to this.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:30.010 align:middle line:90%


01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all
have our people that

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:34.980 align:middle line:84%
have led us up to
this moment that

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
have gotten us to
the place where

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:39.330 align:middle line:90%
we understand what's going on.

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:43.376 align:middle line:84%
It's usually other people or
events that have taken place.

01:00:43.376 --> 01:00:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>You mentioned Oscar Mendoza.

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>Oscar Mendoza,
yeah that's his name.

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.680 align:middle line:90%
He's Mexican, too, I think.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.975 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not-- he might not be.

01:00:53.975 --> 01:00:58.520 align:middle line:90%


01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
He might be from
Colombia or Venezuela.

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:02.047 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

01:01:02.047 --> 01:01:03.005 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, actually.

01:01:03.005 --> 01:01:10.850 align:middle line:90%


01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
There's another thing
associated with-- that's

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.860 align:middle line:84%
different between the
heart and the body.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
this once before.

01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to say
it clearly again.

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:22.130 align:middle line:90%
And that is the emotional body.

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:24.550 align:middle line:84%
You have a different
dream state.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.337 align:middle line:84%
The brain has one
kind of dream state.

01:01:26.337 --> 01:01:27.420 align:middle line:90%
The heart has another one.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.940 align:middle line:90%


01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The brain has one
emotional body.

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And everything is always
polarized with the brain.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you have emotions that
are love/hate relationships

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.090 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a completely
different emotional body

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:47.790 align:middle line:90%
in the heart.

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:48.470 align:middle line:90%
And I mentioned.

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But when you talk about
unconditional love,

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:54.230 align:middle line:84%
that's the only place where
there's unconditional love.

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:58.020 align:middle line:84%
There's never, ever
unconditional love

01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.785 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

01:01:59.785 --> 01:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
All you've got to do
is just find the thing

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
that really offends
the brain or the ego,

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and that personal will stop
their love for someone.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
It really is conditional
from the brain.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.990 align:middle line:84%
About the only time that
human beings have ever felt

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love from the
heart, at least one instant

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that I can think of--
and many women have

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
felt this-- is right
immediately after birth,

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%
the baby comes out.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.620 align:middle line:90%
The cord is still connected.

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And the baby is
sucking on the breast.

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And the mommy looks
down at the baby.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, she's
loving the baby from her heart.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
She would die for
that baby right now.

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe not all
women, but most women.

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's a short time when
they switch from the brain

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.090 align:middle line:90%
to the heart.

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, it's
a different kind of love

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
they're feeling than
what they normally feel.

01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It's that powerful,
unconditional love

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:58.750 align:middle line:90%
from the heart.

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is about the only--
there aren't too many ways.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a life
and death situation.

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:04.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a birth thing.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Or someone's almost dying.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, you realize
how much you love that person.

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, you switch
over to the heart love,

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
which is different
than the brain love.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:24.490 align:middle line:90%


01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are also
two creation patterns.

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
There is a way of creating
through the brain, which

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.122 align:middle line:84%
is polarized, where
you create something

01:03:34.122 --> 01:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and you get what you want, but
you get what you don't want.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.890 align:middle line:90%
It's polarized.

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a way of
creating from the heart,

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.140 align:middle line:90%
completely un-polarized.

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.200 align:middle line:90%
You get exactly what you want.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.650 align:middle line:90%
And it does you no harm.

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing that's in
the brain, any characteristic

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:52.945 align:middle line:84%
that the brain has, the heart
will have that same thing.

01:03:52.945 --> 01:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is
one will be polarized,

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.270 align:middle line:90%
and one will not be polarized.

01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:middle line:90%


01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
There's also a vibration
that is in the heart.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you enter the heart,
the first thing you have to do

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.530 align:middle line:90%
is you have to ask light.

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:12.630 align:middle line:84%
By the way, after
you've done this

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and you get the
whole procedure, then

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.510 align:middle line:84%
when you read "Genesis"
in the first paragraph,

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:21.590 align:middle line:84%
it will become pretty
clear, I think,

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that every time you
go into the heart,

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
you're beginning
"Genesis" again.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.120 align:middle line:84%
You're moving straight through
the same set of procedures

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.850 align:middle line:90%
that you do through. "Genesis."

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:36.739 align:middle line:84%
Which in "Genesis,"
the very first thing

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:37.780 align:middle line:90%
is, "Let there be light."

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.196 align:middle line:84%
You begin through
the whole thing.

01:04:39.196 --> 01:04:46.046 align:middle line:84%
And you really are
entering into the creation

01:04:46.046 --> 01:04:47.972 align:middle line:90%
again every time you do it.

01:04:47.972 --> 01:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, though, you're
going to stay there.

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:52.710 align:middle line:90%


01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So besides when you enter
in, you first ask for light.

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.950 align:middle line:90%
If you get it, OK.

01:04:56.950 --> 01:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get it,
you still keep going.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And the very next thing
I'm going to ask you to do

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is to feel the vibration
that's in there.

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels like
everything is just vibrating.

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you have
a heart beating.

01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:13.043 align:middle line:90%
So it would make sense, I guess.

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:14.820 align:middle line:90%
But it's more than that.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.950 align:middle line:90%


01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:21.755 align:middle line:84%
In the Upanishads,
they say that is om.

01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:25.965 align:middle line:84%
That is the true om, is the
vibration that's in the heart.

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
this sound that's

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
kind of just going on and on
and on and on all the time

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:33.130 align:middle line:90%
it's in there.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
things I'll ask you to do

01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
is to feel that vibration
or hear the vibration

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:43.620 align:middle line:84%
or sense it in
whatever way you can.

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And then once you do
feel it or sense it,

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you for just
a moment, for maybe 45 seconds

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.819 align:middle line:84%
or so, or something like that,
to actually use your voice

01:06:00.819 --> 01:06:03.235 align:middle line:84%
and try to duplicate what
you're sensing or you're hearing

01:06:03.235 --> 01:06:05.040 align:middle line:90%
or you're feeling.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.935 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for that.

01:06:07.935 --> 01:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
That vibration is a key--
it is the key-- for you

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:15.060 align:middle line:90%
to return instantly.

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is feel
the vibration-- [SWOOSH]

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
--then you're right
back there again.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
beginning, we're going

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:23.890 align:middle line:84%
to use different methods
of getting into there.

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But once you're in
there and you know

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.900 align:middle line:84%
where it is and you
know what it is,

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.430 align:middle line:84%
if you can remember
the vibration

01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:31.520 align:middle line:84%
or feel the
vibration, you can use

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.501 align:middle line:84%
that to pull yourself
directly back into it.

01:06:34.501 --> 01:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
You look at a Kogi,
and they'll be sitting

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.575 align:middle line:90%
there talking with words.

01:06:38.575 --> 01:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll just
close their eyes.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.574 align:middle line:84%
And they're
instantly back there.

01:06:41.574 --> 01:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be communicating
telepathically with everyone.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.280 align:middle line:90%
And so they go back and forth.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
If they're with someone that
they know can't do telepathy,

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.660 align:middle line:90%
they'll talk to you.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.215 align:middle line:84%
If they think you can,
they'll just talk to you

01:06:55.215 --> 01:06:56.215 align:middle line:90%
from within their heart.

01:06:56.215 --> 01:07:03.550 align:middle line:90%


01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Just recently when
I was there, I also

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
discovered that
depending on what level

01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:17.680 align:middle line:84%
you are on the mountains depends
on your evolutionary level.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So when you first enter
in at about 12,000 feet,

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
these people are
still using pendulums.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.430 align:middle line:90%
They're still learning.

01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Even though they might be old,
they're still kind of learning.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And you go up 1,000 feet more,
and it's a totally other--

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
they're all telepathic
from there on in.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I lived with
them for about two weeks.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.140 align:middle line:90%
And they gave me a grass hut.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And you sleep in a hammock
and all this kind of stuff.

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And they even let me come
into the [INAUDIBLE], which

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
is a big building about this
big with four fires, one

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.960 align:middle line:90%
for each of the four tribes.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And in there, it's
extremely intimate

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
the way they all lie
together and everything.

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%
And people talk.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're sharing their
thoughts and their feelings

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.480 align:middle line:84%
about everything
that's going on.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And after about a week or
so, they brought me up higher

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.187 align:middle line:90%
into the mountains.

01:08:17.187 --> 01:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there's a bridge
there that they seal off.

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:20.649 align:middle line:90%
It goes across this big river.

01:08:20.649 --> 01:08:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And I actually was
on that bridge.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But they took me up
higher into the mountains

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
into this mountain that was
surrounded by mountains.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a mountain
and then the big mountains

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:33.580 align:middle line:90%
all around it.

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And I had to meet one of
the primary Mamos there.

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:41.319 align:middle line:84%
And he was just sitting
on the edge of a cliff

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and looking out over the cliff.

01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:44.745 align:middle line:90%
And he never turned around.

01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:47.245 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't matter to
them whether they're facing you

01:08:47.245 --> 01:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
or not, because they can
communicate and see, as well.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.990 align:middle line:90%


01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I was there with this
Mamos that was 120 years old.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.670 align:middle line:90%
I could barely keep up with him.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:06.609 align:middle line:84%
He was basically at a slow run
at 12,000 feet to 13,500 feet.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:10.069 align:middle line:90%
And he's 120 years old.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And he looks like he's 60,
which is like a kid to them.

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And so he was guarding me.

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:20.870 align:middle line:90%
He was my guardian.

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:22.325 align:middle line:90%
And he brought me up there.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And he made me sit on a rock.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
When they have meetings,
they call them convenings.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.410 align:middle line:90%
They convene.

01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And they only convene when
they're on rocks, because rocks

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:35.590 align:middle line:90%
are alive to them.

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:36.507 align:middle line:90%
They're living people.

01:09:36.507 --> 01:09:37.548 align:middle line:90%
And that's where they go.

01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:39.229 align:middle line:84%
So we're on this
big rock formation

01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
on the top of this
little mountain.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.270 align:middle line:90%
And the rock came like that.

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:44.689 align:middle line:90%
And they came up higher.

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And he made me sit with my
back up against this rock.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.203 align:middle line:84%
And he says, just find a
place that's comfortable.

01:09:49.203 --> 01:09:49.830 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And then he sat
right next to me.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And the Mamos says
the other one's going

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.500 align:middle line:90%
to call all the other Mamos.

01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:00.175 align:middle line:90%
And nobody did anything.

01:10:00.175 --> 01:10:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually, on the
way up there, we

01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
had a Spanish guy that
was coming with us.

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.932 align:middle line:90%
And he was on his cell phone.

01:10:06.932 --> 01:10:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't imagine
there would even

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:09.598 align:middle line:90%
be towers there or something.

01:10:09.598 --> 01:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
But he could talk
on his cell phone.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And the other man here,
he started laughing.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.160 align:middle line:90%
And he picks up a rock.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.045 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, I got a cell phone.

01:10:19.045 --> 01:10:21.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:25.230 align:middle line:90%


01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I'm sitting
back a little bit,

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.315 align:middle line:84%
because they said the
lights were blinding.

01:10:30.315 --> 01:10:31.190 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't see me.

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting back here with
people on the side looking

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.590 align:middle line:90%
at me in the lights.

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, the Mamos
are going to call people.

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So he's still looking
out over the cliff

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:47.820 align:middle line:90%
and never had turned around.

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.862 align:middle line:90%
And so he doesn't move.

01:10:49.862 --> 01:10:50.820 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't do anything.

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And in just a few minutes,
from every single peak

01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and from every single
place, all these people

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.240 align:middle line:84%
started coming down the
side of the mountains.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.950 align:middle line:10%
And they're running down
these mountains, just

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:06.100 align:middle line:10%
down these things that
you would probably think

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.340 align:middle line:10%
you're going to slide down.

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're just like goats.

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And within a very short
time, 20 minutes or so,

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
there was about 50
Mamos standing around.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.560 align:middle line:90%


01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.150 align:middle line:90%
One started talking.

01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And they talked
for a little while.

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:27.770 align:middle line:90%
But they're talking in Kogi.

01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:29.270 align:middle line:90%
And I can't understand it.

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So my protector
here, he knows what

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking and
everything so he tells me,

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:40.785 align:middle line:90%
he says, close your eyes.

01:11:40.785 --> 01:11:42.700 align:middle line:90%
So I close my eyes.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.715 align:middle line:84%
And like, poof,
he's in my vision.

01:11:45.715 --> 01:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
He's in there,
perfectly in there.

01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:50.520 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, OK, can you see me?

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can see you.

01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear me?

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:54.316 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can hear you.

01:11:54.316 --> 01:11:55.729 align:middle line:90%
He says, OK.

01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm going to
tell you what they're saying.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.149 align:middle line:84%
So he starts translating to
me what the Kogi are saying.

01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm listening to what
they're saying by a translator

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.898 align:middle line:84%
by a guy that's
sitting next to me.

01:12:04.898 --> 01:12:07.220 align:middle line:90%


01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And then about 10 minutes into
it, he's in there talking.

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.982 align:middle line:84%
He goes-- [CHUCKLES]
and he says something.

01:12:13.982 --> 01:12:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And he starts laughing.

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, he's sitting
here, but in the inner-vision,

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
he's rolling on the
ground laughing.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And I go, why are you laughing?

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And he finally gains
composure inside this thing.

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, I've
never spoken English before.

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a weird language.

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:37.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:41.100 align:middle line:90%


01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.950 align:middle line:90%
He says, it feels funny.

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:48.120 align:middle line:90%


01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they can speak
any language at all.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's pretty
astounding how fast

01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:57.480 align:middle line:90%
they can learn a language.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Science has figured out that we
have a place inside of us that

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
can learn any language
in the world in 10 days.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm following
that one right now.

01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I wonder where that goes.

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn a
language in ten days.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.760 align:middle line:84%
There's about 10 of
them I'd like to have.

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.737 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, back to this
thing with the vibration.

01:13:17.737 --> 01:13:21.981 align:middle line:90%


01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It's important that
you can feel it.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can feel it,
you can make this transition

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:33.060 align:middle line:84%
back and forth between
the world of the heart

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.105 align:middle line:84%
and the world of the
brain really, really fast.

01:13:35.105 --> 01:13:39.780 align:middle line:90%


01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And the Upanishads says
that this vibration

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is older than the universe
itself, whatever that means.

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:52.060 align:middle line:90%


01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very similar--
the Great Pyramid in Egypt

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
was built to represent
human consciousness.

01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:05.009 align:middle line:84%
And within there-- it
comes from somewhere,

01:14:05.009 --> 01:14:06.300 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not exactly sure where.

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But in the Great
Pyramid, there is

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
this almost identical, if
not identical, vibration

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:13.590 align:middle line:90%
that's in the Great Pyramid.

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
How many people have been
to the Great Pyramid?

01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
That is about 10 people.

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:21.040 align:middle line:84%
How many people
felt that vibration

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.976 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about when
you were in there?

01:14:23.976 --> 01:14:26.200 align:middle line:90%
So it was about half of them.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Some people don't feel it.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.340 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know how.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're in
there, it feels like

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.700 align:middle line:84%
everything's-- [BUZZING]
it feels like the air is

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.240 align:middle line:90%
vibrating.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.936 align:middle line:90%
Everything is vibrating.

01:14:35.936 --> 01:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first thing
I felt when I went in there.

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:39.680 align:middle line:90%
And I go, what is this?

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything's moving.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.800 align:middle line:90%


01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I just
wanted to bring that up,

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.740 align:middle line:90%
because it's important.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is another thing
that's equally as important.

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is in order
to get into the heart,

01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.360 align:middle line:84%
you must hold that vibration
before you get into the heart.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have that vibration
within you, you can't get in.

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:11.620 align:middle line:90%
It will not let you in.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
get the vibration

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:19.150 align:middle line:84%
before you get there is by
what we call the Unity Breath.

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:20.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a meditation.

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we will lead you
through this before we go.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But in essence,
what it is is you

01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:29.650 align:middle line:84%
must connect with the heart
of the world, with love.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.730 align:middle line:90%
You must love Mother Earth.

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:32.990 align:middle line:90%
You love her.

01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And she sends her
love back to you.

01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:36.520 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, you
connect with her.

01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And then without
breaking that, you

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:43.310 align:middle line:90%
connect to the heart of the sun.

01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:45.594 align:middle line:84%
Really, by doing that,
you're connecting the heart

01:15:45.594 --> 01:15:47.385 align:middle line:84%
to all the rest, the
heart of the universe.

01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:50.410 align:middle line:90%


01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Different tribes do
it in different ways.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi do it by connecting
to the central sun.

01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:57.200 align:middle line:90%
They understand that.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And they connect directly
to the central sun.

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And I learned this
through the Hindus

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:07.280 align:middle line:84%
through Sri Yukteswar,
which is Yogananda's guru.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.837 align:middle line:84%
And he tells you to
connect to the grids

01:16:09.837 --> 01:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
that around the Earth,
because those are connected

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.520 align:middle line:90%
to all life everywhere, also.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a more sophisticated
way, in a way.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.220 align:middle line:84%
But almost all the
tribes I've ever

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
been with, they
connect to the sun.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And our star is connected
to all other stars.

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on and on.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.773 align:middle line:90%
And everything's interconnected.

01:16:26.773 --> 01:16:28.830 align:middle line:90%


01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So you connect to the
sun, the heart of the sun.

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.880 align:middle line:90%
You have to love it.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It's your divine mother
and your divine father.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to connect
to the divine mother.

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And you're the divine child.

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And you connect to
your divine father

01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:48.610 align:middle line:84%
through that heart by
sending love and feeling

01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:50.190 align:middle line:90%
his love come back.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, it
makes the holy trinity.

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:54.470 align:middle line:84%
You have the divine
mother, divine father,

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:56.190 align:middle line:90%
and you, the divine child.

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's a love flow
that goes between the child

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.380 align:middle line:90%
to the mother and father.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
But the child must also be aware
of the love between the mother

01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and the father, that connection
that's going that way, too.

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll lead
you through it.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:16.390 align:middle line:84%
But when you do that, it puts
a vibration in your spirit.

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And that vibration
is the key that

01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:23.933 align:middle line:84%
opens the door that allows
you to enter into the heart.

01:17:23.933 --> 01:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, emotional trauma
could still stop you.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.375 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the pain level
because of emotional trauma

01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:31.100 align:middle line:90%
that stops you.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But that's something
I can't help.

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But with or without, even
if you're totally clean

01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and you have no emotional
trauma and no problems,

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:42.222 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have this
vibration, you can't get in.

01:17:42.222 --> 01:17:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
very often-- and I've

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
seen this many, many, many, many
times-- is people come in here.

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.270 align:middle line:90%
I lead them through it.

01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:50.720 align:middle line:90%
They get into their heart.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.160 align:middle line:90%
They got it.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.740 align:middle line:90%
They go back home.

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And they can't ever do
it again, because they

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:01.137 align:middle line:84%
don't think that this connecting
with the heart of the Earth

01:18:01.137 --> 01:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and the heart of the
sun is important.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.780 align:middle line:90%
And they don't do that.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
And they keep trying to get in.

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But you can't You have
to have this vibration.

01:18:11.230 --> 01:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not that vibration
is identical to the one that's

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.730 align:middle line:90%
inside there, I'm not certain.

01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But if it isn't,
it's an overtone.

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Or it's connected.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Or it's in harmony with it.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Or it is identical.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really sure.

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:26.435 align:middle line:90%
It feels the same to me.

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:27.310 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not positive.

01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:32.690 align:middle line:90%


01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we get to that place,
when we do the first one,

01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I will lead you carefully
through those steps.

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't
ever done it before,

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty easy once
you understand it.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.760 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy to do.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.100 align:middle line:10%
But don't underestimate it
as just something that's

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.280 align:middle line:10%
kind of a nice thing to do.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.260 align:middle line:90%
It's more than that.

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:59.900 align:middle line:90%


01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Just as there are two emotional
bodies and two dream states

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and two ways of
creating and all that,

01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:11.640 align:middle line:84%
the sacred space of the heart
is also divided into two areas.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And the HeartMath discovered
that generated from the heart

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.759 align:middle line:84%
is the largest energy field
that the body creates.

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:24.550 align:middle line:10%
The brain is small
compared with the heart.

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:30.070 align:middle line:84%
This is 8 to 10 feet in
diameter and centered off-center

01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:32.720 align:middle line:90%
from the axis of your spine.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And right through the
center of the heart

01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:39.090 align:middle line:84%
is a toroidal field
that comes up and around

01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and comes back in, just like
the magnetic field of the Earth.

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And there is one big one
and a smaller one inside.

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Those proportions
are very important,

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:51.984 align:middle line:90%
what they've discovered.

01:19:51.984 --> 01:19:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're identical
to what you see up here.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.841 align:middle line:90%


01:19:56.841 --> 01:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who've
studied the first two books,

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
you know that you're
looking at the five

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:06.890 align:middle line:90%
platonic solids in here.

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:11.430 align:middle line:10%
So if you see this cube-- look
at the hexagon that runs around

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.270 align:middle line:10%
and the three lines that
run through the middle.

01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
If you look at only those lines,
you see a cube on an edge view.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at it
like-- this is the cube.

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But you're looking
at it like that.

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And so these lines and
these lines come together.

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:32.990 align:middle line:90%
And they form three lines.

01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So does everybody see
what I'm talking about?

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But then in here farther is
another one, another cube.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.535 align:middle line:90%
There's a cube within a cube.

01:20:44.535 --> 01:20:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's true
with all of them.

01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And here's the star
tetrahedron in here.

01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
go inside smaller,

01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
there's a smaller star
tetrahedron inside of there.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through all
the five platonic solids.

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Each one has a big
one and a little one.

01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of related to
the male and female thing,

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
where males are bigger
and females are smaller.

01:21:12.010 --> 01:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But there is always
this relationship.

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not only
in sacred geometry,

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:22.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's also in the actual
way that the heart configures

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.450 align:middle line:90%
the original place of creation.

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you enter
into your heart space,

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you always enter into
the external space first.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you first walk in
or move into that space,

01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:42.970 align:middle line:90%
you're not in the sacred space.

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It is all sacred.

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:48.790 align:middle line:84%
But they call this
little, tiny place-- well,

01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
the Upanishads keep
referring to it

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
as just the tiny
space of the heart.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.120 align:middle line:90%
But it's more sacred.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And so you first enter
into the external space,

01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
which has relative to
it a size relationship.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
But once you're in
that external space,

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that external space can
appear to you as infinite.

01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It can actually appear to you as
the universe itself, and very,

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.670 align:middle line:90%
very, very often will.

01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But you have to learn how
to find the tiny space.

01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And when I say tiny,
it's usually not

01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:32.350 align:middle line:90%
much bigger around than this.

01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a very small,
little place somewhere.

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:39.630 align:middle line:84%
However, its appearance
could be anything.

01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:40.540 align:middle line:90%
It could be a cave.

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:41.770 align:middle line:90%
It could be a little house.

01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:43.380 align:middle line:90%
It could be a room.

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.520 align:middle line:90%
It could be a spaceship.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.925 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything at all.

01:22:46.925 --> 01:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It could be a temple.

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:55.215 align:middle line:84%
But it is always really
small relative to the big one

01:22:55.215 --> 01:22:55.715 align:middle line:90%
outside.

01:22:55.715 --> 01:23:03.630 align:middle line:90%


01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:07.920 align:middle line:84%
This is also a means
of getting into it.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
This was a problem
I was confronted

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:13.220 align:middle line:84%
with after the Kogi taught
me all these things.

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:19.080 align:middle line:90%


01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.250 align:middle line:84%
There was a point
where they didn't think

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:24.120 align:middle line:90%
that we could be taught this.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And they really only
wanted me to work

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.120 align:middle line:90%
with animals in the beginning.

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So I worked with only
animals in the first part,

01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:35.690 align:middle line:84%
with horses and all
kinds of animals.

01:23:35.690 --> 01:23:39.520 align:middle line:84%
After a while, it got
pretty exciting, really.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I could just
walk into a middle of a--

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
there'd be a bunch
of deer in a thing.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And usually when you
start to walk toward deer,

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.130 align:middle line:90%
they all run away.

01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in
your heart space,

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:52.890 align:middle line:90%
you're not seen as a threat.

01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:54.680 align:middle line:90%
They feel the vibration.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.661 align:middle line:84%
They just look at you and
just keep right on eating.

01:23:57.661 --> 01:23:59.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like a bird landing
on their back or something.

01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:01.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't even mind.

01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:02.546 align:middle line:84%
And I would walk
right up to them

01:24:02.546 --> 01:24:04.587 align:middle line:84%
and stand there and pet
them and everything else.

01:24:04.587 --> 01:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And they would just
keep right on eating.

01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't even disturb them.

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:10.740 align:middle line:90%


01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I could see that
it was biofeedback.

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:15.890 align:middle line:90%
I could see that this was true.

01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:18.210 align:middle line:84%
They also told me the
more wild they are,

01:24:18.210 --> 01:24:20.960 align:middle line:90%
the easier it is to do this.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, I
like being out where

01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:31.620 align:middle line:90%
there are lots of wild animals.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.136 align:middle line:90%
I prefer it.

01:24:33.136 --> 01:24:34.010 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to explain.

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:39.230 align:middle line:90%


01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time
I was in Paraguay.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was just into this whole
thing with animals and stuff.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And somebody says,
well, could you show us?

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And so I went out.

01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
any animals anywhere.

01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:57.650 align:middle line:90%
There aren't even cows there.

01:24:57.650 --> 01:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find anything
hardly, at least where

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.100 align:middle line:90%
I was in Paraguay.

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:02.670 align:middle line:90%
There was just nothing.

01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:03.880 align:middle line:90%
And I was sitting there.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.185 align:middle line:84%
And this big frog-- this
frog was like that big.

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:09.760 align:middle line:84%
[JUMPING SOUNDS] I suppose
he went, ah, animal.

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.580 align:middle line:90%


01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And I just dropped
into the heart.

01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And this little
sound came out of me.

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And the frog went--
[JUMPING SOUNDS] Then he went--

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
[QUICK JUMPING SOUNDS] --right
up to me and looked up at me.

01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And I got down really low.

01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was right down like this
and looking into its eyes.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And we started making sounds
together and all this stuff.

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And these people
were watching me

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And then I was at a break.

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And I had to go back.

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.439 align:middle line:90%
And I said, don't go away.

01:25:42.439 --> 01:25:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right back.

01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:44.340 align:middle line:90%
And it says, OK.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.090 align:middle line:90%
And I go in there.

01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
or three hours.

01:25:46.110 --> 01:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I come back, and it's
still sitting there.

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Hadn't moved.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.840 align:middle line:90%


01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And really, it changes your
relationship to all of life.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It just completely changes it.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Remember in the Bible when it
talks about the Tower of Babel.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It states clearly that
before the Tower of Babel,

01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
there was one
language in the world.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And that one language we
could talk to each other with.

01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And we could speak
with the animals

01:26:26.170 --> 01:26:28.840 align:middle line:90%
with this same language.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that
this is what it is.

01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:32.920 align:middle line:90%
You can speak to any lifeform.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And even ETs understand
this language.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a language that
comes from the heart.

01:26:40.690 --> 01:26:44.900 align:middle line:84%
The Kogi say it's a
language that has no words.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:50.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's a sound
that does not mean something.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a sound that
creates an image in you.

01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they mean.

01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the same sound can
create many different images,

01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:06.720 align:middle line:84%
depending on what your
heart is putting with it.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you that know
Pleiadians, it is Pleiadians.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians people use that
language when they talk.

01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And it is how they
communicate with each other.

01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:23.200 align:middle line:90%


01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, slowly getting there.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
But you need to know
all these little things.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, when we
say, OK, let's do

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.639 align:middle line:84%
it, you're going to
go, let's do what?

01:27:36.639 --> 01:27:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:42.860 align:middle line:90%


01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.910 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that this
is a mental concept and idea.

01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:49.360 align:middle line:90%
But it's really true.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:55.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't be in your
heart-- with the way

01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:59.530 align:middle line:84%
that we have fixed
ourselves into the brain

01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and seeing through
these two eyes,

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
be in your heart,

01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
you have to break
that connection.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.370 align:middle line:90%
You have to leave it.

01:28:09.370 --> 01:28:11.940 align:middle line:90%


01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Later, you can come back.

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about this
when we get into it here.

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Once you get into the heart, you
can reestablish the connection

01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
in a different way
from your brain,

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:26.370 align:middle line:84%
where you could be in your
heart and see from your brain.

01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
But initially, you can't.

01:28:29.130 --> 01:28:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Initially, you have to sever
the connection with the brain.

01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You literally have to
let go of it and move.

01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:38.250 align:middle line:90%
There's a movement.

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:40.340 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual
physical movement

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:45.430 align:middle line:84%
that you have to make in
order to get to your heart.

01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:48.255 align:middle line:84%
And that movement has to
do with spirit itself.

01:28:48.255 --> 01:28:53.690 align:middle line:90%


01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Most people think that
they are their bodies.

01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:59.720 align:middle line:90%
But you're not your body.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Your body is more like
a coat you put on.

01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And spirit can drop that body
and take another body anytime

01:29:06.670 --> 01:29:07.570 align:middle line:90%
it wants to.

01:29:07.570 --> 01:29:10.440 align:middle line:90%


01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.645 align:middle line:90%
You're not this.

01:29:11.645 --> 01:29:14.770 align:middle line:90%


01:29:14.770 --> 01:29:16.350 align:middle line:90%
You're separate from that.

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:18.539 align:middle line:84%
And I think almost everybody
here understands that.

01:29:18.539 --> 01:29:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people in the
world don't understand that.

01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:22.121 align:middle line:90%
They think they are their body.

01:29:22.121 --> 01:29:30.460 align:middle line:90%


01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Spirit-- just
talking about spirit

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.650 align:middle line:90%
itself-- there's great spirit.

01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:36.630 align:middle line:84%
There's one spirit that
moves through all life

01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:43.920 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, of which we are
intimately connected to.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:51.334 align:middle line:84%
But great spirit has also
done all kinds of things

01:29:51.334 --> 01:29:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to create different
kinds of experiences.

01:29:55.270 --> 01:30:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And so our spirit,
really, we can think of it

01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
as coming out like a
piece of the great spirit.

01:30:04.210 --> 01:30:05.500 align:middle line:90%
It's much more than that.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But we are actually great
spirit experiencing humanness.

01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But spirit has an
ability that isn't quite

01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:20.130 align:middle line:90%
understood here on Earth.

01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is that spirit can
either be infinite or finite.

01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you can be
the entire universe

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:35.690 align:middle line:84%
on all levels of existence
simultaneously now.

01:30:35.690 --> 01:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots of
people that have done that

01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and are doing it at this moment.

01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And then a spirit
can also be finite.

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It could be a piece of it.

01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:51.710 align:middle line:84%
It could be a galaxy or a
planet or a sun or an animal

01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
or a human being or an
atom or anything else.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.930 align:middle line:84%
When it's infinite,
it has no center.

01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:03.480 align:middle line:90%


01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.700 align:middle line:84%
There's no place that you
could say, this is the center,

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.910 align:middle line:90%
because it's everywhere.

01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But the moment it chooses
to become finite, whatever

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:17.700 align:middle line:84%
it is-- if it's a
planet, then the center

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:19.700 align:middle line:90%
is in the exact center.

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:22.890 align:middle line:84%
If it's a human being--
it's interesting.

01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are able to
move their center around.

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we can go through
this in a moment.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we will.

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Most people are centered
in their pineal chakra.

01:31:35.770 --> 01:31:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
possibilities.

01:31:40.410 --> 01:31:42.531 align:middle line:84%
You could also be
centered in your heart.

01:31:42.531 --> 01:31:44.030 align:middle line:84%
You could be centered
in your liver.

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:47.990 align:middle line:90%


01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Carlos Castaneda is centered
over his right shoulder,

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe it is, out
here, about that far away,

01:31:56.710 --> 01:31:58.680 align:middle line:90%
not even in his body.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are centered
out here in front of themselves.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:06.310 align:middle line:90%
And they know this.

01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So just for example,
how many people

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.590 align:middle line:84%
know that they're centered
somewhere not in their body?

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:18.850 align:middle line:90%
One-- only one person?

01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:20.532 align:middle line:90%
Where are you centered.

01:32:20.532 --> 01:32:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>It varies.

01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>It varies?

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.220 align:middle line:90%
You move it around?

01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:23.886 align:middle line:90%
>>It fluctuates.

01:32:23.886 --> 01:32:29.460 align:middle line:84%
It seems that it
definitely zips in and out.

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:32.670 align:middle line:90%


01:32:32.670 --> 01:32:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Where are you now?

01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm here.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.546 align:middle line:90%
I'm definitely cognizant.

01:32:38.546 --> 01:32:40.545 align:middle line:10%
One thing that definitely
struck a chord with me

01:32:40.545 --> 01:32:43.265 align:middle line:10%
just now is you said there
could be one intelligence

01:32:43.265 --> 01:32:45.330 align:middle line:10%
in multiple people.

01:32:45.330 --> 01:32:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I look
at myself almost

01:32:47.710 --> 01:32:50.750 align:middle line:84%
like a LimeWire or
a Napster program,

01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:55.800 align:middle line:84%
where multiple things might
be able to utilize me.

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.778 align:middle line:90%


01:32:58.778 --> 01:32:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, there
are whole planets

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.230 align:middle line:84%
where every single
person on that planet

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:08.319 align:middle line:84%
is a cell in a larger
consciousness, just

01:33:08.319 --> 01:33:10.110 align:middle line:84%
the same way that we
have cells in our body

01:33:10.110 --> 01:33:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're all connected
together to create us.

01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And all of us are connected
on other levels of existence

01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:20.310 align:middle line:90%
with other parts of ourselves.

01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really only
referring right now

01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to just this body and
where they're centered.

01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:32.010 align:middle line:84%
In the last workshop, I had
about seven or eight people

01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
that were centered in different
places around their bodies.

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
go inside the body

01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and see where you're centered--

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Inside the body--
is anybody centered

01:33:43.090 --> 01:33:45.400 align:middle line:84%
in some other place other
than the heart or the brain?

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.260 align:middle line:90%


01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you guys are boring.

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:51.845 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:33:51.845 --> 01:33:57.040 align:middle line:90%


01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm not really sure.

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But when I first
started to wake up,

01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:07.870 align:middle line:84%
it's like I would
leave my brain.

01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would think, but I
would be somewhere else.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.880 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like I would come
out here and be something

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.340 align:middle line:90%
of an observer of myself.

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
talking about?

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I really
couldn't identify--

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I was actually going
to ask you about it.

01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Where am I going when I--
something just shifts.

01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking through
my eyes anymore.

01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm out here.

01:34:33.630 --> 01:34:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, there's really a
near infinite possi-- well,

01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I guess it actually
is mathematically

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:43.120 align:middle line:90%
infinite of where you could be.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Usually, though, you're always
inside of your Merkaba field.

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:51.277 align:middle line:84%
Which, the whole Merkaba
field is just a giant sphere.

01:34:51.277 --> 01:34:53.360 align:middle line:84%
You may see the stuff
inside of it and everything.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a huge
sphere, about 55 or 60 feet

01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:58.080 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And usually when
people are centered,

01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:01.920 align:middle line:84%
they're inside that
sphere somewhere.

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:05.260 align:middle line:90%


01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it something
that you can look at?

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.110 align:middle line:90%
And can you see where they are?

01:35:10.110 --> 01:35:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:14.100 align:middle line:84%
That's really-- I don't know
if you could perceive that.

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I guess you could somehow.

01:35:15.450 --> 01:35:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do it.

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I just know that
after talking to lots

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and lots and lots
of people, I know

01:35:23.710 --> 01:35:25.800 align:middle line:90%
that they're not all centered.

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I know that most people are
centered in their heads.

01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
sensation, is that you're

01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:33.140 align:middle line:90%
looking out of your eyes.

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is more going on
here than anywhere else.

01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And maybe when you're in
sexual energy, it's different.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Your attention changes.

01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:44.565 align:middle line:84%
And your centering
changes a lot on that.

01:35:44.565 --> 01:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%
It depends on your chakra system
and where you're focused, too.

01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:50.080 align:middle line:90%
A lot of things.

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I don't
think I'm going

01:35:53.130 --> 01:35:57.890 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get to what I'm
really trying to say here.

01:35:57.890 --> 01:36:02.330 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, I'll just state it.

01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:05.070 align:middle line:84%
When your finite,
you have a center.

01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And that center can
be moved around.

01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And in just a little
bit, we're going

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to move your center around.

01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:14.185 align:middle line:84%
You maybe never moved
your center around before.

01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:17.956 align:middle line:84%
But any minute, it's
going to happen.

01:36:17.956 --> 01:36:20.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do some
exercises where you're going

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.492 align:middle line:90%
to move your center around.

01:36:21.492 --> 01:36:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Once you start moving
your center around,

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.230 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty interesting.

01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Because your view of
the reality can change.

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And when it does change,
you can start doing things

01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that you normally wouldn't
allow yourself to do.

01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
about probably--

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I usually do-- about 30%
of the people in here

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:42.160 align:middle line:84%
will be able to see with
their hands pretty soon.

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
You'll actually be able to look
around the room with your hand

01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:48.590 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you move
your center off.

01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:54.190 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is also
always connected to the heart.

01:36:54.190 --> 01:36:57.070 align:middle line:90%


01:36:57.070 --> 01:37:00.520 align:middle line:84%
There are certain things that
are in the heart consistently.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
water, and usually moving

01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:09.400 align:middle line:84%
water or deep pools of water
that, when you dive into it,

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.820 align:middle line:84%
you come out into other
worlds and things like this.

01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:14.820 align:middle line:90%


01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
the sound of water.

01:37:16.570 --> 01:37:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
is consistent-- in fact,

01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:24.820 align:middle line:84%
you really can't escape
it-- and that is the stars.

01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:28.650 align:middle line:90%


01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You might wake up
and you look in

01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and you find that the
external place of your heart

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:39.952 align:middle line:90%
is a temple, say, a pyramid.

01:37:39.952 --> 01:37:41.160 align:middle line:90%
And there are rooms in there.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So you're going through
all these different rooms.

01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're indoors all
the time when you're

01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:46.810 align:middle line:90%
going through your heart space.

01:37:46.810 --> 01:37:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But then you'll come over
and you'll see a window.

01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:50.118 align:middle line:90%
You'll go over to the window.

01:37:50.118 --> 01:37:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And poof, there are the stars.

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The stars are
always in the heart.

01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:59.910 align:middle line:84%
The Upanishad, those 108 people,
when you read each one of them,

01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
almost every one of
them talks about how

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.750 align:middle line:90%
there are stars in the heart.

01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, right after I
wrote "Living in the Heart"

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and I sent it to my publisher,
the very next day somebody

01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:25.447 align:middle line:84%
sent me this, which
is from the-- I

01:38:25.447 --> 01:38:27.635 align:middle line:84%
don't know if I can say
this right-- Chandogya.

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:31.180 align:middle line:90%


01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are
different Upanishads.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:35.900 align:middle line:90%
There are 108 people.

01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them
have eliminated that

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and brought it down
to a smaller number.

01:38:40.190 --> 01:38:43.380 align:middle line:84%
They just picked out the
best ones is what they did.

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And so there are different
translations of it.

01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:49.479 align:middle line:90%
But this is what it says.

01:38:49.479 --> 01:38:50.520 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the book.

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But most people read it and
don't really think about it.

01:38:53.210 --> 01:38:54.980 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to say it again.

01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:57.860 align:middle line:84%
It says, if someone
says to you, quote,

01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:00.290 align:middle line:84%
"In the fortified city
of the imperishable--

01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:02.770 align:middle line:90%
our body-- there is a lotus.

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:05.760 align:middle line:90%
And in this lotus, a tiny space.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
What does it contain that one
should desire to know it?"

01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
You must reply, "As vast
as this space without

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is, the tiny space
within your heart,

01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.240 align:middle line:84%
heaven and Earth
are found in it--

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.240 align:middle line:84%
fire and air, sun
and moon, lightning,

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.040 align:middle line:90%
and the constellations."

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Whatever belongs
to you here below

01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and all that
doesn't, all this is

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.680 align:middle line:84%
gathered in that tiny
space within your heart.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.210 align:middle line:90%


01:39:34.210 --> 01:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
This is 5,000 or
6,000 years old.

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be just as true
today as it was then.

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:45.912 align:middle line:84%
The stars were originally
created in your heart first.

01:39:45.912 --> 01:39:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the things we're going

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.970 align:middle line:90%
to be talking about later.

01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And later, we're transferred
to the external world.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And they are not what you
think, which I've been saying.

01:39:57.010 --> 01:40:00.730 align:middle line:84%
They're an image, a
dream state image,

01:40:00.730 --> 01:40:03.140 align:middle line:84%
created by the
heart, which was then

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:06.530 align:middle line:84%
transferred to the brain in
a very specific way, which

01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.520 align:middle line:90%
we'll go into later.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we're
living it and believing

01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:17.050 align:middle line:84%
it's real, when, really,
it's just an image.

01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:19.800 align:middle line:90%
It's just consciousness itself.

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:22.850 align:middle line:84%
But you will find the
same stars in your heart

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that you will find
external to the Earth.

01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned
recently-- because I've now

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.870 align:middle line:84%
connected with another
intelligence inside the Earth

01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:37.340 align:middle line:84%
that I never knew was
there-- and they took me

01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:38.890 align:middle line:90%
into the center of the Earth.

01:40:38.890 --> 01:40:46.570 align:middle line:90%


01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:48.870 align:middle line:84%
When you enter into the
very center of the Earth,

01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:50.360 align:middle line:90%
it is external.

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just infinite space,
and the same stars,

01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:00.990 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same
ones, that are there.

01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It's changed my whole view of
everything I thought was real.

01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And now that I understand
it and I understand

01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:09.240 align:middle line:84%
the geometries of
how this is working

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and everything else like
that, it makes so much sense.

01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:14.380 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:18.040 align:middle line:84%
If you take a golden
mean rectangle

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and you take the shorter edge
and come over here and make

01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:22.785 align:middle line:84%
a square out of it,
what's left over

01:41:22.785 --> 01:41:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is another golden
mean rectangle.

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:26.860 align:middle line:84%
We all know this,
or most of us do.

01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:28.771 align:middle line:84%
And so then if you
take the shorter edge

01:41:28.771 --> 01:41:30.896 align:middle line:84%
and make another square
out of it, what's left over

01:41:30.896 --> 01:41:32.320 align:middle line:84%
is another golden
mean rectangle.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And that creates a spiral that
goes in and in and in and in

01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:38.460 align:middle line:90%
forever.

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.250 align:middle line:90%
It never ends.

01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And so it's constantly
getting littler and littler

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.600 align:middle line:90%
and littler and littler.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:50.740 align:middle line:84%
But where you started from,
which is where you are now--

01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:54.252 align:middle line:84%
we're in between the
microcosm and the macrocosm.

01:41:54.252 --> 01:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we start
with this triangle.

01:41:55.710 --> 01:41:58.190 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it goes forever.

01:41:58.190 --> 01:42:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, it'll go
out the other way.

01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:02.389 align:middle line:84%
That triangle, if you
take the longer edge

01:42:02.389 --> 01:42:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and make a square
out of it, you have

01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:06.180 align:middle line:84%
another golden mean
rectangle that's bigger.

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:07.620 align:middle line:90%
And it keeps going out.

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just
keep doing that forever.

01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And now that same spiral
that went in forever

01:42:12.330 --> 01:42:15.040 align:middle line:84%
will now spiral
outwards forever,

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.954 align:middle line:84%
getting bigger and
bigger and bigger,

01:42:16.954 --> 01:42:18.870 align:middle line:84%
this one getting infinitely
big, the other one

01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:20.940 align:middle line:90%
getting infinitely small.

01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
nature of our reality.

01:42:24.450 --> 01:42:30.650 align:middle line:84%
You can go inside the moon, any
star, any galaxy, the Earth,

01:42:30.650 --> 01:42:31.440 align:middle line:90%
or anywhere else.

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to the center,
you'll be in the same stars

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.540 align:middle line:90%
that you were at externally.

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a sphere,
the sphere is the surface.

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.930 align:middle line:84%
That is the size that is
in between the macrocosm

01:42:42.930 --> 01:42:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and the microcosm.

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything external
here, that's all stars.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But you go in the middle--
it's all stars again.

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And science will
eventually-- right now

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:55.920 align:middle line:84%
they're beginning
to understand this.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is changing our
entire view of everything.

01:42:59.630 --> 01:43:04.520 align:middle line:84%
When science really does
understand that one thing,

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:06.350 align:middle line:84%
then spirituality
and science will

01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:09.520 align:middle line:90%
begin to merge and become one.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Because that will happen.

01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:12.200 align:middle line:90%
It always happens.

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Every planet
eventually comes to--

01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:15.860 align:middle line:84%
their scientific
understanding of everything

01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and their spiritual
understanding of everything

01:43:18.710 --> 01:43:20.250 align:middle line:90%
merge at one point.

01:43:20.250 --> 01:43:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
they're no longer

01:43:24.010 --> 01:43:27.812 align:middle line:90%
whatever level they were at.

01:43:27.812 --> 01:43:29.270 align:middle line:90%
They become aware.

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:31.610 align:middle line:84%
That's when they
first really, truly

01:43:31.610 --> 01:43:36.180 align:middle line:84%
become aware of what is
actually happening in the world.

01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We're just looking at a
total illusion right now.

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Science is.

01:43:41.170 --> 01:43:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so are we, spiritually,
on a lot of levels.

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:47.035 align:middle line:84%
We're not quite clear
on what is happening.

01:43:47.035 --> 01:43:49.990 align:middle line:90%


01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I've got to take a time check.

01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:54.801 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we don't have any time.

01:43:54.801 --> 01:43:55.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:58.235 align:middle line:84%
So I only have just
another few minutes.

01:43:58.235 --> 01:44:07.185 align:middle line:90%


01:44:07.185 --> 01:44:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's perfect.

01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:11.520 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have done this
any better if I'd have tried.

01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where we start
going into the sensory aspect

01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:22.010 align:middle line:90%
of things.

01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:23.902 align:middle line:84%
So I pretty much told
you everything you

01:44:23.902 --> 01:44:26.040 align:middle line:90%
need to know on a mental level.

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to start doing it
on a physical, tactile level

01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:31.440 align:middle line:90%
and emotional level.

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think we can just stop
right here and go to lunch.

01:44:37.330 --> 01:44:40.510 align:middle line:90%
And we'll come back at 2:30.

01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we do,
we're going to-- have

01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:47.160 align:middle line:90%
you ever danced in the dark?

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:50.080 align:middle line:90%


01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do dancing
with your blindfolds on.

01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:07.904 align:middle line:90%
