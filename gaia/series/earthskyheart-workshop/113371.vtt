00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>This is day five.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.930 align:middle line:90%
It's called Tantra of the Heart.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, good morning.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.909 align:middle line:90%
>>Good morning!

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Here we go.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Another day!

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a fun day
because it culminates.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.092 align:middle line:84%
It brings everything
together, which

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:25.925 align:middle line:84%
doesn't happen until
almost the last minute.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.076 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're going
to go out into the woods

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and do our final meditation
where, at that point,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:84%
we should note everything
and how to do it.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:90%
But it'll be new to you.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So I will lead you through
it when we get out there.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
In the advanced workshop
if you come to that,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume you
know this staff perfectly.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go beyond
it, which I love that workshop

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:90%
because of what happens in it.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:90%
It's so cool.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.209 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I always have
to look at my notes

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
because I never know where
I'm going or what I'm doing.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.865 align:middle line:84%
So this day is called
Tantra of the Heart.

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
in all kinds of ways

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
and not normal ways.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.316 align:middle line:84%
Ways that you would normally
not probably ever think about.

00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about sexual energy

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates
to spirituality.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's the focus
because sexual energy

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:90%
is the key to creation.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:84%
When you create anything,
it's done with sexual energy.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
There is sexual energy in ways
that you probably have never

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
thought of before, even if
you've really sat and thought

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot about it because
it's just we don't

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:90%
think of a lot of these things.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:84%
There's actually sexual
energy between the heart

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, and not in the
way that we normally think,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't involve
the genitals at all.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a totally different thing.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's still sexual energy.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.091 align:middle line:90%
And it's really powerful.

00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, from
our point of view,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
from a Melchizedek point of view
in our study of the universe,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
every single thing that
came into creation,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and there are things that are
constantly still being created,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.345 align:middle line:84%
came in because of
the union of opposites

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
of the coming together of
the male and female that

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:90%
create that thing.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a
planet, or a galaxy,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
or another universe,
or whatever,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:90%
it's always the same thing.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why we have to
talk about this because you

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:90%
could study spirituality.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:90%
You can meditate forever.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't get
the sexual aspect that's

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
associated with it,
you're wasting your time

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
because you'll never,
ever, get there without it.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to begin speaking
about sexual energy

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:90%
through alchemy.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And my study of alchemy,
it's very appropriate.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And it'll also explain a lot
of what's going on today.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
In the last 50
years or so, there

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
has been changes
in sexuality, which

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure most of the
world's aware of by now,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:90%
that were not there before.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
They were there,
but not in the way

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
that they are now, which
has to do with homosexuality

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:90%
and bisexuality.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're also going to
talk about asexuality.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Asexuality, from a
spiritual point of view,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
is the highest
form of sexuality,

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:90%
which is like no sexuality.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But you can't achieve
that by force.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, the Catholic
church forces people

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to stop having sex,
even when they're young,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:90%
and being celibate.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't work.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they're figuring
that out right now, I think.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The only way that you can
achieve this sexuality

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
is by going through all the
possible sexual combinations.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.967 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way that you
arrive at it in a natural way.

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of them.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:84%
We think that there's only
just a few different kinds

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:90%
of sexuality.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:90%
But there's actually 64.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
64 entirely different,
completely unique,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:90%
forms of sexuality.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And it stretches through all
forms of nature everywhere.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Not just humans, but everything
that reproduces on every level

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:90%
existence.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll slowly get to
all of that and explain it.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to begin with
alchemy because it begins

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
to explain another level of
the reality that isn't really,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.630 align:middle line:90%
usually, understood too much.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy right now, there
are two forms of alchemy

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:90%
that have been recognized.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
One is turning lead
into gold and the other

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:90%
is mercury into gold.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that there has been

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:84%
so much time and energy put on
the subject throughout history

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
is because it's, again,
as above, so below.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
layers to our reality.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:90%
There's the atomic layers.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And they continue on
forever beneath that.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
subatomic particles.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
It's an endless game
that never ends.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's the other way, too.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Like, it goes out forever also.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But on any layer, whether
you're taking a cellular level,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:84%
atomic level, a molecular
level, et cetera,

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:84%
every level reflects
every other level.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes
to human consciousness,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:84%
they've discovered
a long time ago that

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:84%
if you go to a
molecular level and you

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
watch the way lead turns into
gold, the precise procedure,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:84%
the pH levels as they're
changing the temperature

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
levels, and all those
things relate directly

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
to human experience going
from human consciousness

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:84%
into a higher level
conscious sometimes called

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Christ consciousness
or unity consciousness.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just a name.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's the next
level of consciousness

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:90%
above human consciousness.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So to go from here
to the next level,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying
to understand it,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
you can just study the
way lead goes into gold

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
or the way mercury
goes into gold.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
They're two different pathways.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can understand it
just by looking at that.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:90%
You can say, oh, OK.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.667 align:middle line:84%
I realize that coming
up here is going

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:84%
to be an event where
the temperature's going

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:90%
to rise tremendously.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And you have to translate
that into human consciousness

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:90%
and what that means.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually
see the whole thing.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And so that was what
was really going on.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:90%
So they had to actually do it.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.165 align:middle line:84%
They had to actually take the
lead or the mercury into gold.

00:07:43.165 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And they had to see
they were doing it.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, they even studied the
chemistry that was behind it.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the first
things the angels had me do.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
They sent me to, initially,
over about 70 teachers.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And they did that by giving
me their name, address,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and phone number of people that
I'd never even heard of before,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:90%
most of some.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.774 align:middle line:90%
Some of them.

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Like Ram Dass, I knew.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.023 align:middle line:90%
And there were some that I knew.

00:08:06.023 --> 00:08:10.224 align:middle line:84%
But about 3/4 of them
I never heard of.

00:08:10.224 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting
when you just

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
call a name and number
you get from meditation

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.163 align:middle line:90%
and it's that person, you know.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:90%
And they were always ready.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They go, yeah, I
know you're coming.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.954 align:middle line:90%
Come on over, you know.

00:08:22.954 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The angels sent
me to this person.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:90%
His name was Will Chipman.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And he was an alchemist.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:90%
He was truly an alchemist.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
He was not just somebody
thinking about it.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I studied with him for
a little over two years.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And he changed my life
forever, and ever, and ever.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And he used me as a
Guinea pig to study

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:90%
with some of his ideas.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.507 align:middle line:90%
And they worked.

00:08:53.507 --> 00:08:54.215 align:middle line:90%
It was very cool.

00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
He lived in Burnaby,
for you in Canada,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
outside of Vancouver
in British Columbia.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.161 align:middle line:84%
And he lived in,
kind of, a suburb.

00:09:12.161 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Suburb.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.265 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.265 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Suburban area.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Suburban area.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Whatever you call it.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.832 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, whatever
it is, you know.

00:09:20.832 --> 00:09:23.270 align:middle line:90%
All those little boxes.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:90%
They're all the same.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.739 align:middle line:90%
And he lived in one of those.

00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:27.488 align:middle line:84%
So if you were just
driving down the road,

00:09:27.488 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
it looked just like
any other house.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But after a year, one
day he says, OK, now I'll

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:33.442 align:middle line:90%
show you my lab.

00:09:33.442 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And I been going into his house
every day for about a year.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going where's
your lab, you know.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.902 align:middle line:84%
And he takes me over
to a broom closet.

00:09:40.902 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like one of those
Steven Spielberg things.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, he goes in
there, turns a handle,

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.668 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing
is an elevator,

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:48.474 align:middle line:90%
and it goes down to the ground.

00:09:48.474 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was way
down in the ground.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:84%
It was like 100 feet
into the ground.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And we got down
there, there was a lab

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:90%
about the size of this room.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a little bigger, actually.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And it had the finest equipment
on Earth was in there.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had
electron balances,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.645 align:middle line:90%
and it was everything.

00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:84%
He had millions of
dollars in this room.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And he brought me
over to this sphere

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
about so big of,
looked like, Plexiglas.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.409 align:middle line:84%
Perfect sphere
sitting on a stand.

00:10:26.409 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So the sphere was about
this high off the ground.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:90%
It was on a stand.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't know what was
inside the stand.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of motor.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a greenish,
yellowish liquid

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.267 align:middle line:90%
that was in there.

00:10:38.267 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And a little tiny
bit of mercury would

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.395 align:middle line:90%
come out and form a sphere.

00:10:41.395 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And it would start
rising at the bottom.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And you could watch it.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And it'd go through all
these different colors

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.870 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
through transformation.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:90%
It's going up.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.526 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets within
about two inches to the top,

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.087 align:middle line:84%
it would turn into a solid
gold, and drop to the bottom.

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And it did this all
day and all night.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he
had all this money

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.965 align:middle line:90%
to buy all this equipment.

00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And so he really did
know how to do it.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But he also made the
proper interpretations

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:84%
of the chemical
reaction relative

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.242 align:middle line:90%
to human transformation.

00:11:20.242 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:90%
He was very good.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned the other
day that we have now

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:90%
discovered a third way.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, there is now
definitely, it's not a maybe.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
We know for certain there
is another way, which

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:90%
is taking silicon into gold.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And it is much cleaner, simpler,
and easier than the other ones.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that it has ever been

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:90%
done ever before in the world.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:84%
If it has, then it has
been done secretly.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.712 align:middle line:90%
So it could have been.

00:11:56.712 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But I've never seen
anything written about it.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody here ever seen
anything written about silicon

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:90%
into gold?

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I never seen it
either, but it's real.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:90%
We have physically done it.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And they did it 20
times in Phoenix.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Another lab did it 10 times
in another independent lab.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:90%
And we have done it twice here.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're about to start
back into it next week,

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and then begin to
study exactly what I'm

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:90%
talking about right now.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
That may take me
awhile because I don't

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:90%
know exactly what I'm doing.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But there must be a reason
why I'm being given this.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of excited
about it really.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I like games and play.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like a game,
kind of, you know.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's going
to be a fun thing.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now that you
understand about how as above,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:84%
so below, and on
a molecular level

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:84%
that there are these
two, maybe three, things

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that will translate human
consciousness into higher

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, I want to bring
it into a more general pattern

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and make a statement.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
That is that every single
chemical reaction in existence

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:84%
relates to some
life form somewhere.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the entire thing.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:84%
On every level, it relates
to life in one way or another

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.230 align:middle line:84%
where we are now on this
level and on other levels

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:90%
All things are together.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's also true if
you drop down further

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:90%
into the atomic levels.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.470 align:middle line:84%
You go down another one
below molecular level

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:90%
into the atomic levels.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And the atomic reactions that
take place are very basic.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
deep relationships

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:90%
with human life also.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Differently than the
molecular levels, but they do.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to explain this,
I'm going to talk about stars.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And stars from everything I have
learned and know at this point

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:90%
are living beings.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:90%
They are alive.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:90%
They are conscious.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:90%
They have personalities.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:90%
They are people just like us.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But they are existing on
another level of life,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
and so are planets.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Planets and moons.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Some moons are in the
process of being born.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're not quite
into that conscious level.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:90%
But they will be.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
But looking just at
the stars right now

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
or our sun, which is a star
also, you look at the process.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Stars are born.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:84%
They're born from
hydrogen clouds, which is

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:90%
the debris from a dying star.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So when a supernova
goes bam and explodes,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:84%
it puts out all this
hydrogen, which then reforms

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:90%
into hundreds of new stars.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's a form of reproduction.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.435 align:middle line:84%
The death becomes the
birth, which it always is.

00:15:22.435 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:90%
And those stars become born.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
They go through a procedure
that is identical to the way

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that we are creating
the Merkaba.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:90%
It is exactly step by step.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same thing.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing what the stars do
to bring our consciousness up.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing exactly the
same thing on another level.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
it, it is precisely

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
the same exact movement
that we make when we perform

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:90%
the meditation of the Merkaba.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And these stars go
through various stages.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Like, our sun is a hydrogen sun.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:84%
They always begin
as a hydrogen sun.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen is the first element
in the periodic table.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
It's where it all begins,
the very first element.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the hydrogen sun,
it's always the same thing.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
It brings two hydrogen atoms
together through fusion

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and creates helium, which
is one octave above this.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It makes a huge jump.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Really, a huge jump when it
goes from hydrogen to helium.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
produces the light that

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:90%
comes to this planet.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Every scientist on earth will
tell you that all life on Earth

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:90%
came from the sun, literally.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
It is this light that
comes from the sun.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And all the
radiation and pulses,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
that comes here from it,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:90%
is what creates our life here.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.005 align:middle line:84%
If the sun was not there, we
would just be a rock in space.

00:17:10.005 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever
happens on the sun

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
influences us here
big time, huge.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.099 align:middle line:84%
Every time a solar
flare goes off,

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
another level of the cosmic
DNA has been unfolded.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps going.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And it will be a
solar flare, probably,

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that triggers ascension
on this earth.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It comes from the sun.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:90%
But it's more than that.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It's in ways we
normally don't know,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:84%
especially when you talk about
sexuality, which is where we're

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:90%
going in all of this today.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:84%
When the light that is
arriving here on Earth

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is a hydrogen light and it
has a helium element to it,

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and that light determines how
we come together as people

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:90%
in sexual relationships.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:84%
You remember in the
book we mentioned

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:84%
that the male aspect
of our race, the father

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
aspect of our race, we
said was from Sirius.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And the female aspect
was the Nephilim

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
from the planet Marduk or
Nibiru is another name for it.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the Sirian family
that came here, I mentioned,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:90%
was 16 males and 16 females.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:90%
And they were married.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is
that on that planet, which

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
happens to come from Sirius B--
there's three stars up there.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
A, B, and C. And they come
from Sirius B, third planet

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:84%
out, just like this one, which
is a near completely water

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
There's only one island on it
about the size of California.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, one
little tiny island.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's more water
than anything.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And on that planet, the
people that are on that land,

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
they only, only, marry
16 males and 16 females.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:90%
No other way.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:90%
They would never dream of it.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.593 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't dream of it.

00:19:27.593 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:84%
17 would be, oh my
God, never do that.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.780 align:middle line:90%
That's bad.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Only 16 and 16.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:90%
And so why?

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find, if you
go to other planets,

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.000 align:middle line:84%
there's very specific
geometrical arrangements

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that are there the way
people come together

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:90%
to make relationships.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
a certain planet,

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:90%
you won't see anything else.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
It'll only be that
and nothing else.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of
these configurations.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:90%
And we stay with it.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
On our planet, it has been
one male and one female

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:84%
for a very, very,
very long time.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:90%
That's about to change forever.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the
process of doing that.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
It'll usually take
about 50 to 100 years.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're still
probably, at least,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
50 years away before
it will click in.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:90%
And we won't be here.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to be able
to see this take place here,

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:30.610 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what life
is going to do.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
going to make it.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But the reason we are
one male and one female

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
is because the hydrogen atom
has one-- well let me just

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:90%
make another statement first.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:84%
If you go down
below atomic level,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a point where
there's only three things

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the proton,
electron, and neutron.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:90%
And the proton is in the center.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
The neutron is
also in the center.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And electron goes
around it if you

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:84%
want to accept the Bohr's
understanding of it in reality.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is the proton

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
has an atomic mass
of whatever it is.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And the electron has a
much, much lower mass also.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And the neutron is exactly the
male and the female, the mommy

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and daddy.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:90%
The proton is the male.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:90%
The electron is the female.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:90%
And the neutron is the child.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.355 align:middle line:84%
And the child has the exact
mass of it's mommy and daddy.

00:21:39.355 --> 00:21:41.575 align:middle line:84%
It is of a proton and
electron, precisely.

00:21:41.575 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty interesting.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And so if you see that
the proton is male,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:84%
the electron is female, and
the neutron is the child,

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
this is the holy
trinity, again, emerging

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:84%
on a very, very low level,
even below atomic level.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the light that's
coming from our sun

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is a hydrogen that has just
moved into helium light.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's the hydrogen
component that

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:84%
determines how everyone,
all life on this planet,

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:90%
comes together, pretty much.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:90%
There are exceptions.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And because that light is
based on one proton, and one

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.110 align:middle line:84%
electron, and one neutron,
that's what we do.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
We arrange ourselves in
configuration with a light

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:90%
that's coming from the sun.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It has so much influence
on us, it's just crazy.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But in 1972, and Bell
Labs showed this,

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:84%
it so important
because we've gone

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.520 align:middle line:84%
for about five
billion years, depends

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:90%
on who you want to talk to.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
The sun has been doing this
for about five billion years.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is it's
constantly making helium.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the helium starts
building up in concentration.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And after about
five billion years,

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that concentration of
helium gets so strong

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:90%
that a new reaction begins.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And the sun goes from a
hydrogen sun to a helium sun.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And we just happen
to be at that moment.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of moments that
just happen to be right now.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going from one
kind of light to another.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And so now on August 7, 1972,
we had this blast of expansion.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get to see it
all because the Sirian's

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:84%
knew that we were
not ready for this

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:84%
because we had had an accident
right prior to it on Atlantis.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And we should have been in
position to know how to deal

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:90%
with this, but we weren't.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:90%
And so they helped us.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But still, at any rate,
what's emerged on earth

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a
brand new kind of light.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
When the helium triggers into
the next stage of a sun's

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:84%
growth, it's three helium atoms
coming together forming carbon.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And so this light
is a helium light.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:84%
But it has a component of
carbon associated with it too.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And so helium is two
protons, two electrons,

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.582 align:middle line:90%
and two neutrons.

00:24:33.582 --> 00:24:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Got to put another
finger in there.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens,
at that point,

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.620 align:middle line:84%
is we go through
a transformation.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason
why homosexuality

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.430 align:middle line:90%
is emerging on earth right now.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Whether you like it or not,
it's just what's happening.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can't stop it
because it's nature.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:90%
It's what's going on.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So in the future at
some point, we're

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
going to come together with
two males and two females.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And we will have two different
kinds of children come out

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:90%
of these relationships.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:90%
And everyone will do only that.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And they will never think
of doing anything else.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:90%
But we're not there for sure

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
transformation going

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
on where women are
getting together

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and men are getting together.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
they'll come together.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't stay that
way for very long.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they come together
because you can't reproduce.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
However, it is one
way that mother earth

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:90%
can stop the overpopulation.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
The more there is of that,
the less children there are.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:90%
The less babies are being born.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So it does have a
positive aspect on that.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.796 align:middle line:84%
I'm not I'm not
promoting anything.

00:25:58.796 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.485 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy with my wife.

00:26:03.485 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying that I'm
not judging anything either.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking at it
objectively of what's going on.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And if we didn't have such
a stigma associated with it,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:90%
this would be easier to accept.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:90%
But we do.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just
the way it goes.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
This light that's coming in now
is changing not only sexuality

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
or how we come together.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:90%
That's just one thing.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It's changing lots
of things about us.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:40.890 align:middle line:84%
This light really started to
emerge about 150 years ago.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:90%
It just reached a peak in that.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's being transforming us
slowly in all kinds of ways.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We are not the same people who
we were four or 500 years ago.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
There is a huge difference in
who we are, and how we think,

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's just, again, it's
the cosmic DNA unfolding

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:90%
through the light of the sun.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:84%
The light of the
sun is everything.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It is simply everything
relative to a planet.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:90%
And the stars keep going.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, if you were
to wait a very long time--

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
another few billion year-- the
carbon would begin to ignite.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, you
would have a carbon

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:84%
has six protons, six
electrons, and six neutrons.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:90%
It's the 666, which is us.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:90%
We're carbon based life forms.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, everything
would transform over.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
It would take about
100 years or so.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:90%
We would transform over.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.685 align:middle line:84%
And we'd become families
of six males, six females,

00:27:48.685 --> 00:27:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and there'd be six different
kinds of children that would

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.860 align:middle line:90%
come from this relationship.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the way it
will be for sure if the sun

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:90%
where to last this long.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And it continues on.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, the star dies.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.004 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
ways it can die.

00:28:10.004 --> 00:28:11.670 align:middle line:84%
It can become the
supernova that we just

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:84%
talked about where it blows
up and forms massive hydrogen

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:90%
clouds that form other sons.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It could also go within itself
and become a white dwarf

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and compress itself into this
unbelievably compressed mass

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that is so heavy that, if
we just took one inch of it

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and set it gently
on the earth, it

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:84%
would go right through the
earth right to the other side.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
It weighs so much.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Nothing would stop it.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.205 align:middle line:90%
And it just go right through.

00:28:42.205 --> 00:28:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And it would start
oscillating back and forth

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and, eventually, end up in
the center of the earth.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It's incredibly heavy material.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:90%
It's thousands and thousands.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It's tons, actually, just in
a small little piece of it.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.210 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
basics, I think, of that.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And it gets more complex
because we're a single star

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.730 align:middle line:90%
system, which is very unusual.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:90%
There aren't very many.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Most star systems are
two or more stars.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Most of them are binary systems.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the most.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's two male components
in the solar system.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And like in Sirius,
there's three.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's other ways
for these stars to die.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple other
ways that it's possible.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.215 align:middle line:84%
But they do go through a
life and death process.

00:29:47.215 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason why when
you get more than one sun

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and they're different
ages, especially

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.640 align:middle line:84%
like what's going on
in Sirius, and Sirius A

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:84%
is the brightest
star in the sky.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a 4.6 magnitude.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's the brightest
star we can see.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a big, huge star.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.670 align:middle line:90%
But Sirius B is a white dwarf.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little,
tiny star and very

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:90%
weak in its output of light.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have Sirius
C. And I don't really know.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:84%
They just discovered
Sirius C not too long ago.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what that star is.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you are coming
from space and you

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know what
the people were doing

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:84%
on these different stars,
before you ever got there,

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.360 align:middle line:84%
you can analyze the
sun's that are in there

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of
life that is coming

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:84%
from each one of those
suns to the planets.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can just calculate
exactly how they come together.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.540 align:middle line:84%
It's more complex to figure out
than it is if it's just one.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
If it's one, it's
really straightforward.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But if it's two or
three in different ages

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and different kinds,
then it's more complex.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.810 align:middle line:84%
But in that case, it was
16 males and 16 females.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And they would be able to make
16 different kinds of children

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.250 align:middle line:84%
uniquely different in
how they perceive life.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:27.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's the introduction.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:90%


00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.705 align:middle line:90%
Let me move this over here.

00:31:36.705 --> 00:31:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to talk about
human sexuality itself.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And this does not
apply to just humans.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.115 align:middle line:84%
It applies to all forms
of life everywhere.

00:32:01.115 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So you'll understand when we
go through this the complexity

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of the human sexuality.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to
study it in detail,

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:90%
read the I Ching out of China.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.770 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Some people say I Ching.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
pronounced I Ching.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the book of changes.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:34.540 align:middle line:84%
There are 64 different
hexagons that

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.110 align:middle line:84%
move through this in
a very specific order.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:41.630 align:middle line:84%
The first order
is all-male lines.

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it
wasn't that way always.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.250 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.840 align:middle line:90%
We're in the male cycle.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And during the male cycle,
one of the males changed it.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It originally started
out all-female lines.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And female is the basis at
the beginning of things.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't like that
and reversed the whole thing.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And to me, beginning with the
female lines is more accurate.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's what we got.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:90%
It's still incredibly accurate.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:21.300 align:middle line:84%
There have been three medical
doctors who've written books

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.850 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.924 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
about each other

00:33:24.924 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:84%
because I've talked
to a couple of them.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I actually wanted to
discuss this with them.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know
that somebody else

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.940 align:middle line:90%
had written the book.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you read the three
books, it is identical.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.120 align:middle line:84%
It is so much identical
that if they ever

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.737 align:middle line:84%
went into copyright court, they
would have a really hard time

00:33:42.737 --> 00:33:44.570 align:middle line:84%
because it looks like
the other one stole it

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.180 align:middle line:90%
from the first one.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:84%
They were just going
purely from science

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and relating what they could
see about the DNA to what they

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:90%
see about the I Ching.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And it describes
in detail, and I

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:03.770 align:middle line:84%
mean in minute
detail, the human DNA.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's so perfect,
it could never

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:84%
have been just a
guess or an accident.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievably accurate.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it just
shows you the power

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:90%
of what is behind this book.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And so you can also see
where the polarities reverse.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It goes from male to female,
male to female, male to female.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.929 align:middle line:84%
There's 32 male, 32 female, and
they alternate every other one

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:90%
going through the whole thing.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these
different sexual polarities

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:84%
that they refer to
in there are uniquely

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.310 align:middle line:90%
different than any other one.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.150 align:middle line:84%
They are all
completely different.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if you really want
to study human sexuality,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:58.660 align:middle line:84%
look at what it says about each
one of these different changes.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, you'll understand
what the 64 human sexualities

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:08.680 align:middle line:84%
are in detail and also
how it relates to the DNA.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But on a real simple
level, I'm only

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
the first eight

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going
to further talk

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.520 align:middle line:84%
about how the Egyptians
feel about this

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:90%
and what they did about it.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were only concerned
about the first eight

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.269 align:middle line:84%
because they superimpose
something else over.

00:35:29.269 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'll describe what that is.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because it's
another thing you need to know.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It helps to know it because
it answers a lot of questions

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:90%
that are going on in life.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'll use the black
one since it's easier to see.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm first going to layout out
this pattern of how sexuality

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:90%
goes.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And we will relate
it to human sexuality

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.190 align:middle line:84%
so it is in our language,
so we know what it means.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:84%
If I did it with grasshoppers,
it wouldn't quite be the same.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.730 align:middle line:90%
But it is the same.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.540 align:middle line:90%
But there is only one energy.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Just this single energy.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one energy,
really, in existence.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And all the other forms
of energy and physics

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.800 align:middle line:90%
all come from a single energy.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that
will be very clear.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But most physicists suspect
this is true anyway.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And that one energy breaks
into two basic patterns,

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:51.120 align:middle line:84%
which is male and female,
a male and female energy.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, that energy
breaks down further into--

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to
make it into a tree.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:84%
There's this four, which
we talked about before.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The male, the female,
the male and female,

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.640 align:middle line:90%
and the asexual or neutral.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
four basic energies

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.190 align:middle line:90%
that run through things.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it
in so many ways.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.600 align:middle line:84%
You have a male component,
a female component,

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
you have both, and
you have neither.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And just like in the
nucleic acids and the DNA,

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:84%
like I mentioned also before,
there are four of these acids.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.605 align:middle line:84%
And they combine to produce 64
different codons in the DNA.

00:37:42.605 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And those codons, to me,
they're like applications

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:90%
in a computer.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're only running
on about 20 or 21,

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.740 align:middle line:90%
22, something like that.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of them
that we have in our DNA

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:84%
are just sitting
there not being used.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.780 align:middle line:84%
The new children who are coming
in have brought in six more.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And they don't use
all six of them.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Each one chooses two.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these
different kinds.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So all the indigo
kids and everything,

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.180 align:middle line:90%
they're not the same.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:84%
They're completely
and uniquely different

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:84%
because it depends on which
applications they chose.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:26.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's just like a computer.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:84%
If you stuck in two
applications, well

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.420 align:middle line:84%
it depends on what
those applications do.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.090 align:middle line:84%
If some other kids puts in two
more and they're different,

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to be
depending what they are.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a lot of
different combinations

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:90%
of what's possible.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And so science has
now determined--

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:52.400 align:middle line:84%
it's not just me saying
this-- that there are many,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:84%
many, many children now
with two more codons

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.400 align:middle line:90%
turned on in their DNA.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots
of changes, which

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.590 align:middle line:90%
we talked about in the books.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Like, the indigo kids have a
completely different stomach

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.610 align:middle line:90%
than we do and a liver.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.280 align:middle line:90%
They are able to eat junk food.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.770 align:middle line:90%
They're made for it.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Gimme.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.985 align:middle line:90%
Gimme Twinkies.

00:39:13.985 --> 00:39:14.684 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:14.684 --> 00:39:15.986 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to somebody
else the other day.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.651 align:middle line:84%
I said it's kind of
like we're cockroaches.

00:39:19.651 --> 00:39:24.100 align:middle line:84%
If you give us bad enough stuff
long enough, we'll want it.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Good stuff.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.770 align:middle line:84%
We just take it from the
negative into the positive.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And if that's what
it's going to be,

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to
make it positive.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we did.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So they are able to
digest and use food

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.540 align:middle line:84%
in a different kind
of way than we can.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Or at least, I'm saying we.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of indigo
people in this room.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:54.120 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so from these four
basic patterns of male, female,

00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:01.458 align:middle line:84%
both, and neither, there is
a pattern that has developed.

00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:04.852 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to write it out.

00:40:04.852 --> 00:40:07.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to write the
whole thing out, and then

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.960 align:middle line:84%
talk about it because
it takes a little bit.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:15.562 align:middle line:84%
So it's a male/male, which
we call heterosexual.

00:40:15.562 --> 00:40:20.130 align:middle line:84%
A female/male, and we
call that homosexual.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a female/female.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
heterosexual female.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.900 align:middle line:10%
And then, you have a
male/female, which is lesbian.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:10%
A male/bisexual, and
that is a male bisexual.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.470 align:middle line:10%
And then, you have
a female/bisexual.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:41.614 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have a male/asexual
and a female/asexual.

00:40:41.614 --> 00:40:43.405 align:middle line:84%
Computer graphics would
be so much quicker.

00:40:43.405 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
eight basic patterns

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:52.865 align:middle line:84%
that goes from one to two
to four, and then to eight.

00:40:52.865 --> 00:40:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It then goes to
16, to 32, to 64.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.507 align:middle line:90%
And so the polarity continues.

00:40:58.507 --> 00:41:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going
to continue with it.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So like with a
male/male heterosexual,

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.390 align:middle line:84%
there's also on
the next level it

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.480 align:middle line:84%
becomes a passive
and an active one,

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.730 align:middle line:90%
which is like male and female.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And that passive and active
runs all the way through here.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So the same way
with homosexuals.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:19.550 align:middle line:84%
There's passive,
inactive homosexuals,

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.550 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, all the way
through this whole thing.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And even with asexual,
it still has this balance

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:36.680 align:middle line:84%
between male and female, even
though they're not sexually

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:90%
active.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.134 align:middle line:84%
If you continue with it and you
can you keep breaking it down

00:41:41.134 --> 00:41:42.633 align:middle line:84%
and you go through
this whole thing,

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:44.806 align:middle line:90%
you can come up with all 64.

00:41:44.806 --> 00:41:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can relate
that to the I Ching.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.305 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see.

00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can go write
specifically what

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.630 align:middle line:90%
each one is inside of there.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can study
it in great detail.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not going to do it.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.420 align:middle line:90%
But you can do it if you want.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I need to go this far
because I want to talk

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:90%
about the Egyptian part of it.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:84%
This, by the way, let see
if I have that in here.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:14.114 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:15.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I'm going to
wait just a moment.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.779 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to talk
about nature in a minute

00:42:17.779 --> 00:42:21.270 align:middle line:84%
because this is throughout
nature everywhere.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.880 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop with humans.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It's with every single life form
that moves or breaths on Earth.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians were
very much into this.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And their ideas of tantra are
uniquely different than anybody

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.040 align:middle line:90%
else I've seen.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.150 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Tibetans or the Hindus,

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:46.550 align:middle line:84%
their concepts of
tantra are one way.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:50.450 align:middle line:84%
You look at the Chinese
like through Mantak Chia

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:51.860 align:middle line:90%
and his work.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're more interested
in the flow of the energy

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of how it moves and everything.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the Egyptians have
got the flow primarily down

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:84%
to a single movement,
which is the arc.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that a little bit later.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But their concepts
of tantra are more

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:90%
interested in something else.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And in order to talk about
it, I got to explain it

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.590 align:middle line:90%
because it's different.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of
important to know this

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.090 align:middle line:84%
because, if you
do it, you'll see

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:32.260 align:middle line:84%
it'll answer a lot of things
that are going on in life.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.840 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians believe
that you're not

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.490 align:middle line:84%
a human being fully until
you've had eight lifetimes.

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Eight.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And after you completed
the eighth lifetime

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and you go into
your ninth lifetime,

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.660 align:middle line:84%
then you're a fully
developed human being.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because they
discovered a long time ago that

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.090 align:middle line:84%
with a star tetrahedron,
when you come in,

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:84%
you have to come in
as a male or a female.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.460 align:middle line:90%
You have to choose one.

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.300 align:middle line:90%
But you have to choose one.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.535 align:middle line:84%
So if you choose a female,
the configuration around you

00:44:10.535 --> 00:44:12.160 align:middle line:84%
is going to be with
this point forward.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.270 align:middle line:84%
If you choose a male, it's
going to be this one forward.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of your
lifetime, your first lifetime,

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.984 align:middle line:84%
you've developed a
personality over that

00:44:23.984 --> 00:44:26.400 align:middle line:84%
through the environment you're
in, the family you're with,

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.660 align:middle line:84%
the friends you know, and
the things that happen.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:33.260 align:middle line:84%
You create and
develop a personality.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But then when you die,
you can't be female again.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:42.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to be male to keep
the balance because if you

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:47.250 align:middle line:84%
do two male or two female in
a row, your life is over here.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It will throw you
out of the Earth.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.110 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do it.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to become
male or the opposite

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.210 align:middle line:90%
that you did in the first one.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you were female
the first time,

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.230 align:middle line:84%
then you're male
the second time.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, you're
going to be somewhere else.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.360 align:middle line:84%
A different family, a different
place on earth somewhere else,

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to develop
a brand new personality.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to be male.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So your sexuality
will be different

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:90%
but so will be everything else.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The foods you like, the colors
you like, the music you like.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Everything will be different.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Then, on your third life,
it must be female again.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.860 align:middle line:10%
And you choose another one.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And you switch not
to the ones that

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.349 align:middle line:84%
now have personalities
built on it,

00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:34.890 align:middle line:84%
but you choose one
of the other ones.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And you come in
with another female.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.314 align:middle line:84%
And you develop
another personality.

00:45:40.314 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Female, and then
you go to a male,

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and you keep going until
they're all completed.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.470 align:middle line:90%
And this rotates, too.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.420 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing
we've never talked about

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.190 align:middle line:84%
but where we say that you
got one going this way,

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and one going this way, and
you have one that's fixed.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.620 align:middle line:84%
You can move the fixed one
under certain conditions.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with the orgasm.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the only moment
when you can move it.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get back to
that in a little bit.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And so after eight
lifetimes, you've

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:10.020 align:middle line:84%
developed for male and
for female lifetimes,

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.360 align:middle line:90%
again, relating to the I Ching.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:19.970 align:middle line:84%
The I Ching is based on a
cube, rather than the star

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:20.570 align:middle line:90%
tetrahedron.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same thing.

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:25.800 align:middle line:84%
A star tetrahedron is a cube
if you turn it this way.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.910 align:middle line:90%
So they see it as a cube.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But we're looking at it
as a star tetrahedron.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:31.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same thing.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And so in the I
Ching, the whole thing

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.560 align:middle line:84%
is if you read before
you begin into it,

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.580 align:middle line:84%
it's all based on the mother,
the father, the three sons,

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:90%
and the three daughters.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.280 align:middle line:84%
That is the basis
of the I Ching.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly what they're
talking about in China

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.730 align:middle line:84%
is the same thing that they
were talking about in Egypt

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that you have four or
eight personalities.

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Four male and four female.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's who you are.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in one
of these lifetimes,

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.020 align:middle line:84%
you don't know about
the other ones.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.070 align:middle line:90%
They're hidden to you.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:08.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't know they're there.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.940 align:middle line:84%
You're just living that
one that you're in.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But you have seven other
distinctly uniquely different

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:84%
personalities than the one that
you have right now if you've

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.071 align:middle line:90%
been here for eight lifetimes.

00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:24.196 align:middle line:90%
This is my second lifetime.

00:47:24.196 --> 00:47:26.090 align:middle line:90%
So I only have one.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.810 align:middle line:90%
I was a female the first time.

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I have one developed now.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.570 align:middle line:90%
And know I'm on the second one.

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not considered
human yet by the Egyptians.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.309 align:middle line:84%
I haven't lived here long
enough to get that distinction

00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:40.350 align:middle line:90%
from their point of view.

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:44.564 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.564 --> 00:47:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And so all of their
understanding of ascension,

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.770 align:middle line:84%
which was primarily based on
Resurrection, not on ascension.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Resurrection that the Christians
are using came out of Egypt.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's really clear
if you study it.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.990 align:middle line:90%
It was not delivered by Jesus.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.850 align:middle line:90%
It was long before him.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:17.970 align:middle line:84%
The information that he was
putting out around Resurrection

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:20.640 align:middle line:84%
was already
established in Egypt.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And he was completing it.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:30.720 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians knew
that Jesus was coming.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And they knew what he
was going to teach.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
preparing for it.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.770 align:middle line:90%
They prepared 500 BC.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.040 align:middle line:84%
They were already
aware that Jesus was

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.630 align:middle line:90%
coming 500 years in the future.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They were very good at knowing
what was coming in the future.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I don't want
to get into that too much.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:54.940 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.940 --> 00:49:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in the Egyptian
way of perceiving not just

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:10.430 align:middle line:84%
sexuality but spirituality and
consciousness that they would

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.450 align:middle line:84%
go through the
left eye of Horus,

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.870 align:middle line:84%
they would go through
the right eye of Horus,

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:19.480 align:middle line:90%
and each one was 12 years.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, there was three years
after that where they studied

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.680 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about now.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.327 align:middle line:84%
They began to study this at
Kom Ombo, the second chakra

00:49:29.327 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:90%
of the temple there.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.040 align:middle line:90%
They studied sexuality.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.540 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of
sexuality continued

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:41.410 align:middle line:84%
through all the schools because
it's so basic to everything.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end,
what they would do

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.910 align:middle line:84%
is they would take a
person who was a candidate

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:51.230 align:middle line:84%
to go into the Great Pyramid and
be one of those that would go

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.180 align:middle line:84%
into the heavens and
become the heavens,

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and come back and be
an immortal being.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:58.770 align:middle line:90%


00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:02.980 align:middle line:84%
That person was subjected
to an interesting thing.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.204 align:middle line:84%
And we've done this
in a ministry school

00:50:05.204 --> 00:50:06.370 align:middle line:90%
we used to have for a while.

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I did this with two
or three people.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But it was, at least, two
people that we did this with.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And I watched what happened.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.870 align:middle line:90%


00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend
you try this at home.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Probably not a good idea.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll never be
the same if you do.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:31.760 align:middle line:90%


00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.550 align:middle line:84%
After a person has reached a
certain level of awareness,

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.800 align:middle line:84%
then what they do is
they do a ceremony

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and a procedure that you become
aware of all of your eight

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:51.400 align:middle line:84%
personalities at
once, simultaneously.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.790 align:middle line:84%
They all come forth at
once in your one body.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:58.442 align:middle line:84%
And they share information
with each other.

00:50:58.442 --> 00:51:00.525 align:middle line:84%
So they're sharing all
their wisdom and knowledge.

00:51:00.525 --> 00:51:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're bringing
it all into one place.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when you step into the
Great Pyramid in that point

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:11.280 align:middle line:84%
there, you are not
normal human being.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You have absorbed and brought
in all the various levels

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:18.190 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:23.030 align:middle line:84%
This procedure when they
do it, how they do this

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.312 align:middle line:84%
is that they're breathing
through their Merkaba

00:51:27.312 --> 00:51:28.395 align:middle line:90%
field and the whole thing.

00:51:28.395 --> 00:51:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And they're aware of this.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're using sexual
energy with Merkaba

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.390 align:middle line:84%
in a very specific
way, which we'll slowly

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:42.670 align:middle line:90%
unfold here as we go.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:47.980 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular
ceremony, what they do is they--

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a few days to do
it-- at the moment of orgasm

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.380 align:middle line:84%
when it comes up,
they arc the energy,

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.260 align:middle line:84%
which we'll talk about
again in a little bit.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.760 align:middle line:84%
But you have eight
breaths, exactly,

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.730 align:middle line:84%
from the first moment that the
energy comes up your spine.

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.050 align:middle line:84%
You have eight
breaths to do this in.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:13.990 align:middle line:84%
After that, it's
not usable anymore.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
through intention,

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:21.270 align:middle line:84%
you can turn your tetrahedron
to any other point.

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that,
that personality

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:29.950 align:middle line:84%
emerges out of the body and
the other one recedes away.

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so suddenly, I
mean, if you were female

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and you did this energy coming
up, and you transformed it,

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and you turned it to a
male, you're now male.

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:47.230 align:middle line:84%
You may be in a female
body, but you are male.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.620 align:middle line:90%
And you have male sexuality.

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:55.410 align:middle line:84%
You have male and whatever
that male's ideas,

00:52:55.410 --> 00:53:00.380 align:middle line:84%
understandings, wisdom,
desires, and all those things

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.950 align:middle line:90%
that create the personality.

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:04.230 align:middle line:90%
That's who you are now.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:09.430 align:middle line:90%


00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And they slowly move
through all of them,

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:14.020 align:middle line:84%
which also means
rotating it over this way

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.600 align:middle line:84%
to the top to get
to this other one.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.450 align:middle line:90%
So they're coming forth.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And so these different
personalities, one by one,

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.056 align:middle line:90%
come out.

00:53:26.056 --> 00:53:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, they do this thing
after each one has come out.

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.600 align:middle line:84%
You've rotated
through all of them.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And once they write in sequence
after each other, one male, one

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:37.350 align:middle line:84%
female, one male, one female
and they do this whole thing,

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:40.490 align:middle line:84%
there is this way, which
I don't quite understand.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:42.180 align:middle line:90%
But I've seen it happen.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.660 align:middle line:90%
But I haven't experienced it.

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:45.300 align:middle line:90%
So I don't quite understand it.

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:49.970 align:middle line:90%
They all come out at once.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're all in you at once.

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And they all can
communicate at once.

00:53:54.760 --> 00:54:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is the final step before
going into the great pyramid.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted you
to understand that you

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.870 align:middle line:90%
have this aspect to yourself.

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:12.700 align:middle line:90%


00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it does
come out, and especially

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.820 align:middle line:84%
during sexuality
because sometimes people

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.917 align:middle line:90%
turn these things by mistake.

00:54:19.917 --> 00:54:21.705 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:21.705 --> 00:54:25.080 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Because it only takes intention.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a female
and all of a sudden you

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:34.710 align:middle line:84%
are in a sexual
fantasy as being male,

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and it just happens
to be the right way

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:46.504 align:middle line:84%
to turn one of these things,
it could become permanent.

00:54:46.504 --> 00:54:49.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, oops.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.485 align:middle line:90%
No, it's oops.

00:54:50.485 --> 00:54:52.259 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:52.259 --> 00:55:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:06.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just so you have
the understanding.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:14.190 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a lot of knowledge
to be able to do this properly.

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:15.630 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do it by yourself.

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:17.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
external people that

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:23.980 align:middle line:84%
are watching you go through
these stages and guiding it.

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.810 align:middle line:90%
It's more complex.

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:29.181 align:middle line:84%
But what they did, they
knew that this was true.

00:55:29.181 --> 00:55:30.930 align:middle line:84%
They knew about these
eight personalities.

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So did China know about
the eight personalities.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And what the Egyptians did
was they took the eight

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.290 align:middle line:84%
personalities, and
they combined it

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:47.580 align:middle line:84%
with the first eight of these,
producing 64 different types

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:53.380 align:middle line:84%
of connections with their
eight personalities, which this

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.070 align:middle line:90%
is not conforming to nature.

00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:57.870 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that they created.

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And they used it
in their schools.

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Nature just simply
keeps going on

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.060 align:middle line:84%
with the polarity down to
64 different possibilities.

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But they combined the two, did
that, and linked them together.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I don't know.

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:25.680 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It may be that they had these
eight personalities linked

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:36.480 align:middle line:84%
with these eight different
sexual polarities.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.270 align:middle line:84%
What happened with
me is I was studying

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian tantra with Thoth
and his wife for years.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And I got about a little
more than halfway through it.

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
ascended masters made

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.010 align:middle line:84%
this decision that they were
all going to leave and go

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:02.130 align:middle line:84%
do this thing where they went
into space, and dimension

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and made the journey
that we're going to make.

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was in
about 1996 or so.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were gone, I
think, for six years.

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.620 align:middle line:90%
And so I just stopped.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, I didn't
get the rest of it.

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, in approximately 2002,
I was sitting in my office.

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:28.301 align:middle line:84%
And something just pulled
over to Thoth's picture.

00:57:28.301 --> 00:57:29.300 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking at it.

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.930 align:middle line:90%
And Thoth came in.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:32.970 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't seen him in six years.

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And he came in.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And he was not the
person I knew before.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.015 align:middle line:90%
He was transformed.

00:57:41.015 --> 00:57:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Before, he was an
incredibly intense person.

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And his name before Thoth was
Chequetet Arelich Volmalites.

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.970 align:middle line:90%
And Chequetet is a title.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It means the seeker of wisdom.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And well he wasn't
seeking anything anymore.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Whatever had happened
in this movement

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.810 align:middle line:84%
through all these
levels and coming back

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:09.200 align:middle line:84%
is that you could
tell he was calm.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.070 align:middle line:90%
He was not looking anywhere.

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:14.770 align:middle line:90%
He was just doing his job.

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:19.410 align:middle line:84%
He had been transformed
by that journey.

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And so all he did was
come in and say I'm back

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and told me that half
of them had come back

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like this,
some basic things.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And he says I'll be back later.

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So his whole moment with me
was, maybe, three minutes.

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.810 align:middle line:90%
And then he was gone.

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, about
two weeks later, he

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.280 align:middle line:90%
came back with his wife Seshat.

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.932 align:middle line:84%
And we had a long talk
then about what happened

00:58:45.932 --> 00:58:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and all the kinds of
things that were going on.

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, he said that he
was too busy to complete it.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But he left his
wife Seshat with me

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.090 align:middle line:90%
to complete the tantric school.

00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:02.340 align:middle line:90%
But she did it at high speed.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.247 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was like
in about two weeks.

00:59:04.247 --> 00:59:05.830 align:middle line:84%
She stayed with me
for about two weeks

00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and [SOUND EFFECT]
was not the same

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:14.540 align:middle line:84%
as what was before where it was
very slow and understanding.

00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:17.790 align:middle line:90%
So I kind of got it.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:23.010 align:middle line:84%
But I have not a perfect
understanding, I don't think,

00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I just realized right now I'm
not sure why they did this.

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm beginning to
see why they did it

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:30.320 align:middle line:90%
as I'm looking at it right now.

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.080 align:middle line:90%
But I still don't know for sure.

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this is one of
the Egyptian mystery schools.

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to switch
subjects again

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and that is to talk about
this in terms of nature.

00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:02.290 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to
look at it and study it,

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:06.650 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that this
sexuality and then

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:10.470 align:middle line:84%
with all the other changes and
all the other polarity visions

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that go below it are
throughout nature.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.130 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned before
the one about bees

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:23.290 align:middle line:84%
how not only do we have all
these polarities with it,

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:26.575 align:middle line:84%
but we use different
mathematics to reproduce with.

01:00:26.575 --> 01:00:29.480 align:middle line:84%
The human beings are
using a binary sequence.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 62, 64,
which is based on this.

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But the bees, which we
just gave you one example,

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:46.810 align:middle line:84%
they start out at 1,1 2, 3, 5,
8, 13, 24, 21, 34, 55, 89, et

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:47.450 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's Fibonacci in nature.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So the bees have a
different geometry

01:00:54.470 --> 01:01:00.484 align:middle line:84%
behind how they create
their reproduction.

01:01:00.484 --> 01:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But they still have
this moving through.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Everything has this
moving through it.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And so every life form
has a different geometry.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:10.930 align:middle line:90%
And lots of them use binary.

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Two primary ones
are binary sequence

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.990 align:middle line:90%
and Fibonacci sequence.

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:16.970 align:middle line:90%
There may be others.

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:20.204 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised if there
are other ones, and especially

01:01:20.204 --> 01:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
other dimensions
and other places.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:26.800 align:middle line:90%


01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
There are also what we mentioned
how in our relationship

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.740 align:middle line:84%
you have to have one male and
one female to make a baby.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
completely accurate.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how we think about it.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But science now knows, we
mentioned in the other book,

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.730 align:middle line:84%
females can make
babies without males.

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.840 align:middle line:90%
And science can just do that.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.692 align:middle line:84%
They could just go in and
just take a little thing,

01:01:51.692 --> 01:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and poke a hole in the
ovum, and stimulate it.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And it'll produce a baby without
ever having sex or anything.

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, there is
also another way

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
where they could do that,
which is inner dimensional sex.

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:10.680 align:middle line:90%
This is another thing.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
With inner dimensional sex,
you can get pregnant just

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:18.872 align:middle line:84%
by yourself having
sex but connected to,

01:02:18.872 --> 01:02:20.455 align:middle line:84%
at the same moment,
with another being

01:02:20.455 --> 01:02:22.700 align:middle line:90%
on another level of existence.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is your
immaculate conception.

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And immaculate
conception has now

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
been proven,
scientifically, as fact.

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:35.170 align:middle line:90%
It can take place.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.450 align:middle line:90%
But not just with humans.

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:43.289 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have geckos, these
little lizards, which we also

01:02:43.289 --> 01:02:44.080 align:middle line:90%
mentioned in there.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But you could go on for the
rest of your life searching

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.880 align:middle line:90%
these things out.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
There's female geckos
that don't have any males.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
There are no males
in them at all.

01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:58.770 align:middle line:90%
They're all female.

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But they have
babies on their own.

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:04.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's always a female.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So where does that fit into
the ideas of where things are?

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But we were asked to
do all possibilities.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the primary
instructions from the source

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.020 align:middle line:90%
is to try all possibilities.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And definitely,
that's a possibility.

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:25.770 align:middle line:90%
And it is true.

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:28.650 align:middle line:90%
It is fact on earth.

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:32.710 align:middle line:90%
They studied seagulls.

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's been this big
study back in the 1990s.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that
worldwide 14% percent

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.680 align:middle line:90%
of all seagulls are lesbians.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.620 align:middle line:90%
This is fact.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.597 align:middle line:90%
They don't like guys.

01:03:46.597 --> 01:03:47.680 align:middle line:90%
They just like each other.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.805 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it goes.

01:03:48.805 --> 01:03:55.250 align:middle line:90%


01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there's, in the tree
form, I'm just using this one,

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:01.570 align:middle line:90%
there's papayas.

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Papaya trees.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And in Australia, not
here, but in Australia,

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
papaya trees are
male and female,

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
which they are all
around the world.

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But in Australia, they have
male papaya trees, female papaya

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
trees, and bisexual papaya trees
that don't need other trees.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.590 align:middle line:84%
They can do it
all by themselves.

01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the stores in Australia,
you can buy normal papaya.

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can buy bisexual
papaya, and it says so.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Bisexual papaya trees.

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:39.770 align:middle line:90%


01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:40.810 align:middle line:90%
They taste different.

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:43.275 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:43.275 --> 01:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%


01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.865 align:middle line:84%
So the worlds making a
really big deal out of this.

01:04:52.865 --> 01:04:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
it's such a big deal.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
You should just be whatever
you are and just forget it.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans,
this is one thing,

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I've been with
lots of these guys.

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And all of them
that I'm aware of,

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
they don't care what
your sexuality is.

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Just whatever it is, great.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't even care.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:19.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not even an issue
with them what it is.

01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
You are what you are, and
that's the way it goes.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
However, your
sexuality can change.

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you are male
and you turn your thing over

01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:39.811 align:middle line:90%
to female, well, guess what?

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:40.560 align:middle line:90%
You're now female.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually turn it
again to come back to a male

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:43.960 align:middle line:90%
again.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't turn
it back to the same male

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
or you turn it to another
male, you're a different male.

01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Your wife might understand
that and see that it happened.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:56.720 align:middle line:90%


01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Totally different thing.

01:05:58.170 --> 01:05:59.940 align:middle line:90%
And this happens all the time.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And people think they're
crazy when it happens.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So therapists are always
trying to figure out

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:06.970 align:middle line:90%
multiple personalities.

01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Multiple personalities
could be simply

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:13.256 align:middle line:84%
that they've opened up 1, 2, 3,
or 4 of these different things.

01:06:13.256 --> 01:06:14.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's all it is.

01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be an entity
inside of you speaking

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
through them, which
is a completely

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:21.510 align:middle line:90%
different thing than that.

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have to determine
which one is it.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty easy
to determine that.

01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It only takes about
three or four minutes,

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and you can know
exactly what's going on.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
You can't kick
out a personality.

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
You cannot remove
the personality.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
It's going to stay there
no matter what you do.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And that person can't
change it either.

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And so they can, but
more likely, not.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And so they just
have to get used

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to living with more than one
personality inside of them.

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like Tar the United
States of-- what's that movie?

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>United States of Tara.

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>The United States of Tara.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It's so funny because
that what she's projecting

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:09.780 align:middle line:84%
is closer to this of
different personalities

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that are emerging out
of her that are actually

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
just personalities and
not some kind of entity

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:25.042 align:middle line:84%
that's in her,
though it's possible.

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, it could even
be a combination of both.

01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:29.366 align:middle line:90%
Life is very complex.

01:07:29.366 --> 01:07:33.180 align:middle line:90%


01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Now the other
thing that I wanted

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
to put to you for
contemplation, put it that way,

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:47.860 align:middle line:84%
is that there is only one source
of energy in the sexual world.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
But that energy is at the base
of the spine is where it is.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.260 align:middle line:90%
It's in the base chakra.

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But how you perceive
it depends on what

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:03.300 align:middle line:90%
channel is coming up the body.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.490 align:middle line:90%
There's five channels.

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:06.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's in the book.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
If you go back in the first
book, you'll see them.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And they rotate it 90
degrees as they move around.

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:14.280 align:middle line:90%


01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But if it comes up
one of the channels,

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.069 align:middle line:90%
that's called a sexual orgasm.

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:25.160 align:middle line:84%
If the same energy comes
up another channel,

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.149 align:middle line:84%
it's called a
Kundalini experience.

01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And if that same energy
comes up another channel,

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.069 align:middle line:84%
right now, we're
only functioning

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:36.649 align:middle line:90%
on two of these channels.

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And we are, at this
moment, opening up

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.189 align:middle line:84%
a third one, which has
to do with an orgasm that

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
is generated from the heart,
not from in any other procedure.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a heart orgasm.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's two more
that are in the future.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.220 align:middle line:90%
We can't access those yet.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.470 align:middle line:90%
We're not old enough.

01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:59.560 align:middle line:90%
But we will eventually.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But the heart orgasm is
now a potential on Earth.

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And some of you may
have experienced this

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.097 align:middle line:84%
if you're doing this work
because if you're in your heart

01:09:10.097 --> 01:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and you're going back and
forth between your heart

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and your brain, your heart and
your brain, eventually, what

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:18.814 align:middle line:84%
happens is the
toroidal fields that

01:09:18.814 --> 01:09:21.439 align:middle line:84%
are created through the heart--
those two fields that we showed

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
you that are
generated from here--

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
are off center from your Merkaba
or your axis of your spine.

01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
this orgasm, which

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.439 align:middle line:84%
is more intense than sexual
orgasm and far more intense

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:40.085 align:middle line:84%
even then a Kundalini experience
and lasts about 20 minutes.

01:09:40.085 --> 01:09:42.481 align:middle line:90%


01:09:42.481 --> 01:09:43.939 align:middle line:84%
When I experienced
those, I thought

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I was dying really because
I couldn't explain it

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.319 align:middle line:90%
to myself in any other way.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what was going
on here because it just

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.819 align:middle line:84%
kept going on and on and
on, and it never stopped.

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:55.691 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:59.910 align:middle line:90%


01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
at the end of that,

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
the heart toroidal fields move
over to the heart chakra, align

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
with the other toroidal fields
from your Merkaba field,

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and they phase lock, which means
that you are now permanently

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:22.940 align:middle line:84%
There's no going back
and forth anymore.

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.430 align:middle line:90%
You're there.

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:27.010 align:middle line:90%
It's forever, at that point.

01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:29.390 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a possibility.

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And probably everyone's
going to experience this

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.570 align:middle line:90%
at one point or another.

01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it ever happens
more than once because I've

01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:38.350 align:middle line:90%
only experienced it once.

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And it may be a one
time thing only.

01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%
It appears to be true.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Once this field
is moved over, it

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
takes 20 minutes for that thing
to move over and phase lock

01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:51.150 align:middle line:90%
with the Merkaba.

01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:54.090 align:middle line:90%
But once it does, that's it.

01:10:54.090 --> 01:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And experientially, what
happens is everything starts

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:01.431 align:middle line:90%
becoming transparent.

01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
right through walls.

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty
interesting, actually.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.202 align:middle line:90%
You see right through walls.

01:11:06.202 --> 01:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And you see this stuff
on the other side.

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But then, everything starts
becoming transparent.

01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, the energy
gets really intense.

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes white,
like this paper.

01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:19.910 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a very white opaque.

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:21.720 align:middle line:90%
You can't see through it at all.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And that lasts for
a good 15 minutes.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I was
like-- it's like being blind.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.230 align:middle line:90%
You can't see.

01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Only it's white
instead of black.

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:33.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's what was scary to me.

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So if that ever happens to you,
just go, oh well, I remember.

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Just relax, and get
behind it, and have fun.

01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I was really, kind
of, concerned.

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And once it happens,
it changes everything.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.310 align:middle line:90%


01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's really hard to
explain this right now.

01:11:55.650 --> 01:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But my essence, my spirit, is
in my heart at this point now.

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I reside.

01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned how to
look through these eyes

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.840 align:middle line:90%
and function out here.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.960 align:middle line:90%
But I'm still not really here.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.591 align:middle line:90%
I'm really somewhere else.

01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:14.605 align:middle line:90%
And it just happens.

01:12:14.605 --> 01:12:16.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do anything.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.150 align:middle line:90%
It's just what happens.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:19.470 align:middle line:90%
This is the result.

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
that have been

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
through this, usually, the
only thing they want to do

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:29.142 align:middle line:90%
is stay in meditation.

01:12:29.142 --> 01:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And so you get a
lot of people that

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
are living in these caves
that just sit there.

01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Actually, if you totally
go all the way with this,

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
you break the
bonds with gravity.

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And you float off the
ground about this far.

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.950 align:middle line:90%
And you glow.

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Your head glows.

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But your whole body
glows with light.

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:48.400 align:middle line:90%


01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.300 align:middle line:90%
And then, life uses you.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
They're the dreamers that
keep everything in balance.

01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have people in
the world right now.

01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.100 align:middle line:90%
There's four or 500 of them.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And if it wasn't for them,
we would have crashed

01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:05.700 align:middle line:90%
and burned a long time ago.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Without them, we would not be in
this room, for sure, right now.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So I really appreciate
their existence.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But my purpose had
to be completed.

01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:22.480 align:middle line:90%
So it's hard for me to do this.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.400 align:middle line:90%
I would love to just stay there.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
That's my desire
is to stay there.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.030 align:middle line:90%
But I can't.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I have to complete this.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So they've shown me
this way to do this.

01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:39.440 align:middle line:90%


01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, now once we get
this information,

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.980 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to
turn this into reality.

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just giving you
a bunch of stuff to do.

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.974 align:middle line:84%
We're going to actually do
what we're about to say here

01:13:50.974 --> 01:13:51.640 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:57.270 align:middle line:90%


01:13:57.270 --> 01:14:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I know would like to
go over and explain

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.410 align:middle line:90%
how you create from your heart.

01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
This is pretty important.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:12.522 align:middle line:84%
Over here, we have the
creation from the brain,

01:14:12.522 --> 01:14:16.290 align:middle line:90%
which I could put up here.

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:21.650 align:middle line:90%


01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And maybe just to
pose the two together.

01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:32.085 align:middle line:90%
And this one we saw.

01:14:32.085 --> 01:14:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one we're
suggesting you don't do.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But probably, you
will try it anyway.

01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:39.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's the way it goes.

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But the other one is how
to create from your heart.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make this really
clear of what we do with this.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is creating
from the heart.

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:15.549 align:middle line:90%


01:15:15.549 --> 01:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just run
through it quickly.

01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And then, we'll discuss it.

01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
But the heart does not
have a thinking process.

01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:24.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not a brain.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.650 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't think.

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
What it does is
it creates images.

01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:31.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's an image world.

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And so it begins with
dreaming or images.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%


01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.397 align:middle line:84%
The whole process of
creating from there,

01:15:49.397 --> 01:15:50.563 align:middle line:90%
that's where it starts from.

01:15:50.563 --> 01:15:53.170 align:middle line:90%


01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So it has nothing
to do with thinking.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.802 align:middle line:84%
And it has absolutely
zero to do with logic.

01:15:59.802 --> 01:16:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have anything
to do with that.

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:04.327 align:middle line:84%
This is a world where
you can be-- it's just

01:16:04.327 --> 01:16:05.410 align:middle line:90%
like when you're dreaming.

01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
You can be dreaming
that you're in Italy,

01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and the next day
you're in Australia

01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:11.410 align:middle line:84%
or next second
you're in Australia.

01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:12.890 align:middle line:90%
And how did you get there?

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:14.220 align:middle line:90%
What flight did you take?

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.030 align:middle line:90%
There's no logic.

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
You just, dink,
and you're there.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
nature of this place.

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:22.570 align:middle line:90%


01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It's natural.

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the way it is.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And what triggers
the dreams and begins

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
to move them into reality
is, again, not logic.

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:38.000 align:middle line:90%
But it's emotions and feelings.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:49.270 align:middle line:90%


01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
It's emotions and
feelings that are

01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
what begin to pull these
images from the heart

01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:58.900 align:middle line:90%
out into this outer world.

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Then, it begins to come
closer to what this one is.

01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:06.740 align:middle line:90%
So the source is different.

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.810 align:middle line:84%
But then, you come
back to attention.

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:14.040 align:middle line:90%


01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.990 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to write this.

01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:18.365 align:middle line:90%
Attention or not.

01:17:18.365 --> 01:17:20.960 align:middle line:90%


01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Different than that.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.270 align:middle line:90%
This one requires attention.

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
This one here, you can either
use attention and intention

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
like you did over
there-- in other words,

01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
you can specifically get
an image in your heart

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and purposely pull it
into existence or not.

01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:48.050 align:middle line:84%
In this state of
consciousness, you

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:52.290 align:middle line:84%
can simply surrender
to the source of life

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and let yourself be a vessel.

01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Or the source of life
chooses what images,

01:17:58.450 --> 01:17:59.940 align:middle line:90%
and they will come through you.

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:02.640 align:middle line:90%


01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I definitely recommend,
in the beginning,

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.370 align:middle line:90%
that you try the or not side.

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Just see how it works.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.820 align:middle line:90%
And let God bring them out.

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a bad thing.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.740 align:middle line:90%
You can't do any harm.

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:19.150 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to use intention.

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:20.610 align:middle line:90%
But you don't have to.

01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to be the one
to choose what changes are made

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:29.700 align:middle line:84%
in the world, you can allow the
source of life or Mother Earth.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:32.520 align:middle line:84%
You can give it to Mother
Earth, and she can do it.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
people that's all they do.

01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:38.472 align:middle line:90%
They don't use their ego.

01:18:38.472 --> 01:18:39.180 align:middle line:90%
They don't think.

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:40.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't do anything.

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
They just become a channel
that can totally connect

01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:46.490 align:middle line:90%
to the earth and to life.

01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
They stay in their
heart all the time.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And they just let these
images in their meditation,

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
their dreaming state
of the meditation,

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.230 align:middle line:90%
come forth out into the world.

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't cause
harm because where

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:06.860 align:middle line:84%
this is generated by ego, that's
doing this thing over here,

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
there's no ego here when
you're in this space.

01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And the heart,
whenever it pulls,

01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
even if you ask for
something to happen

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:26.920 align:middle line:84%
or if you don't, the
heart will give it to you

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.760 align:middle line:90%
or bring it into the world.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But it will not cause
any harm at all.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.707 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing that it
has that kind of intelligence

01:19:34.707 --> 01:19:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that it could figure
out how to do something

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:39.690 align:middle line:84%
without causing any
negative reaction anywhere

01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:43.110 align:middle line:90%
in the universe, at all.

01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:45.370 align:middle line:84%
The intelligence that
it would take to do that

01:19:45.370 --> 01:19:47.470 align:middle line:90%
is just astounding.

01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:48.650 align:middle line:90%
But it is true.

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.380 align:middle line:90%
It will not do it.

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So again, you can
bring this down

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.854 align:middle line:84%
like you do, and this one
over here, to intention.

01:19:56.854 --> 01:20:01.895 align:middle line:90%


01:20:01.895 --> 01:20:02.395 align:middle line:90%
Intention.

01:20:02.395 --> 01:20:05.000 align:middle line:90%


01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Intention or not because
it's the same thing.

01:20:12.970 --> 01:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
You're either going
to put your intention

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.400 align:middle line:84%
on a particular
thing, and then you're

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.100 align:middle line:84%
going to use your
intention, say, I

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:21.780 align:middle line:84%
want this, whatever
it is, to happen.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.320 align:middle line:90%
I want to heal my mother.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to help
someone or whatever.

01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can either do that,
you can come down this side,

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
or you can just
leave it up to God.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, what brings
it into reality

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.780 align:middle line:90%
is a very interesting process.

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And this process is,
somewhat, complicated.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
It's much, much more
complicated than this.

01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to sound a
little strange at first.

01:20:54.430 --> 01:21:10.890 align:middle line:84%
But what actually does
it, it begins with the tip

01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:19.820 align:middle line:90%
of your tongue and alpha waves.

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.126 align:middle line:90%
I know this is little.

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:22.500 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
come up later, you

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.750 align:middle line:90%
can photograph it and get it.

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
What this says is the tip of
your tongue and alpha waves.

01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:30.110 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:33.200 align:middle line:90%


01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Why does the tip of the
tongue have anything

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.680 align:middle line:90%
to do with anything?

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And what's alpha wave?

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to have to
talk about this for a moment

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.360 align:middle line:90%
to get you to understand.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:49.200 align:middle line:90%
You have a question?

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Well we have to
get the-- oh, OK.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.299 align:middle line:90%
We'll get you in just a moment.

01:21:57.299 --> 01:21:57.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you tell us which
one of the five channels

01:22:01.730 --> 01:22:05.230 align:middle line:90%
connected to the three orgasms?

01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm not certain of that.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.230 align:middle line:90%
I was going to do that research.

01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And almost for certain,
the sexual orgasm

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.150 align:middle line:84%
is associated with,
starting from the front,

01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:20.090 align:middle line:90%
it's one of the first two.

01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
looking at a female,

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
the clitoris, then

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.680 align:middle line:84%
the opening of the vagina, then
the perineum, then the anus,

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.580 align:middle line:90%
and then the tip of the spine.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And those are your
five openings.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And the male clitoris is
just related to the penis.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's an opening inside
the male testicle, the sack.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And more than likely, it's
the first two, the clitoris

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.710 align:middle line:90%
and the penis.

01:22:50.710 --> 01:22:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And it makes a very wide swing.

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:55.600 align:middle line:90%
There's a straight line.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's two
that go like this.

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's two more that
are very much wider that move

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.024 align:middle line:90%
up through the whole thing.

01:23:01.024 --> 01:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Each one passing through each
chakra but with a wider swing.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.740 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted to
know which channels

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.020 align:middle line:90%
were associated with which one.

01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't done
that research.

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:15.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not positive.

01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't really care.

01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to know,
you just do the research

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.680 align:middle line:90%
and find out.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Second question related to
the connection to the heart.

01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
If you try to teach
someone to do that

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and he's already very
much in his heart,

01:23:34.230 --> 01:23:37.650 align:middle line:84%
it might be that the way to
enter that field would not

01:23:37.650 --> 01:23:39.262 align:middle line:90%
be on the heart itself.

01:23:39.262 --> 01:23:41.630 align:middle line:90%
It would be on the center.

01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>The center is
the heart chakra.

01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is definitely a
way to enter into the heart.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, the
angels that I'm working with

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:55.640 align:middle line:90%
told me not to use this way.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:59.620 align:middle line:90%
I just followed them right now.

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.520 align:middle line:90%
But for sure.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely for certain, this is
a direct entryway to the heart.

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean, if someone
had the process

01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to describe the heart
orgasm and the field move,

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
you can see that the field
would be always in the center?

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>That's exactly
where it moves from.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
The field moves from
the physical heart

01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:23.957 align:middle line:84%
over to the heart
chakra, and then

01:24:23.957 --> 01:24:25.540 align:middle line:84%
aligns with all the
rest of the fields

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:27.370 align:middle line:90%
are aligned with the chakra.

01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>And it will stay there?

01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>It does stay there, yes.

01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't leave.

01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:34.790 align:middle line:84%
That's how you can tell if
somebody's solid, permanently,

01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:36.160 align:middle line:90%
in their heart or not.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:43.020 align:middle line:84%
If you had the equipment,
you can see these fields.

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.720 align:middle line:90%
We know how to do it.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians
know how to do it.

01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:47.230 align:middle line:90%
They've done it.

01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And we, in the United States,
have probably done it.

01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
about anyone else.

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But China is probably
right behind there.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.210 align:middle line:90%
They've probably done it also.

01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:59.004 align:middle line:90%
But it's really expensive.

01:24:59.004 --> 01:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the average
guy can't run around

01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and make this kind of
equipment because it's

01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:09.270 align:middle line:84%
so expensive to look at a field
hat is only 4 degrees Kelvin.

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.575 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

01:25:10.575 --> 01:25:13.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's expensive to do it.

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a
very inexpensive way

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
of doing it where we could
map point, by point, by point.

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:24.297 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't lay
out all the points

01:25:24.297 --> 01:25:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and see the whole field at once.

01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So every time we wanted
to see something,

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.420 align:middle line:90%
we can go into a certain point.

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And we could prove it
if it was there or not.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.875 align:middle line:84%
But to see all the
possible points,

01:25:33.875 --> 01:25:38.330 align:middle line:84%
it was way too
expensive for us to do.

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:46.150 align:middle line:90%


01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>My question, I just
need a little bit more

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
clear on the emotion or feeling
part and just how, I guess,

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.520 align:middle line:84%
those first two steps
compare and contrast

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.230 align:middle line:90%
from the brain and the heart.

01:26:00.230 --> 01:26:01.226 align:middle line:90%
>>These two steps?

01:26:01.226 --> 01:26:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, OK.

01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
The brain is a thinking
process machine.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.960 align:middle line:90%
And it uses logic.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, that's where
the process of how you try

01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
to create something,
that's where it begins.

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
This begins when
you're in the heart.

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:23.100 align:middle line:90%
It's an imaging field.

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go in there,
once you ask for light,

01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
you just start seeing
all these images.

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.470 align:middle line:90%
It isn't a thinking process.

01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:31.797 align:middle line:90%
It's an imaging process.

01:26:31.797 --> 01:26:33.130 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see all these images.

01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:36.310 align:middle line:90%


01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And when an image comes up that
you have an emotional response

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
to or you have feelings that
come up physically and et

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
cetera in yourself,
that's what separates all

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.670 align:middle line:90%
the various possible images.

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:59.660 align:middle line:84%
You choose one, basically, by
your emotional response to it.

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:02.770 align:middle line:90%


01:27:02.770 --> 01:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But once you feel this
image, and this is the image

01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:10.630 align:middle line:84%
through your feeling body
and your emotional body

01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that you want to exist
in the world, that's

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.840 align:middle line:90%
where you begin from.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:18.230 align:middle line:84%
That's when you say your
attention goes there.

01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:20.679 align:middle line:84%
Your intention is, yes,
I want that to happen.

01:27:20.679 --> 01:27:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And here's how you do
it, which we're going

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:23.840 align:middle line:90%
to talk about in a minute.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.814 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

01:27:24.814 --> 01:27:26.275 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:27:26.275 --> 01:27:27.736 align:middle line:90%
>>Can you invite the image?

01:27:27.736 --> 01:27:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Or it has to be an
image that shows?

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, you can invite the image.

01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:37.300 align:middle line:90%
You can control that, too.

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%


01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But the image must be
there in the heart.

01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:46.700 align:middle line:84%
If you can't find the
image, you can't do it.

01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.840 align:middle line:90%
But you can create the image.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But once you get into
this, it's like no one even

01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:56.220 align:middle line:90%
knows it's happening.

01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:59.500 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy and so simple.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But you can solve all of
your problems from here.

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:06.370 align:middle line:84%
You can solve all forms
of healing, period.

01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:11.820 align:middle line:84%
You can gain weight, lose
weight, bring money to you,

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:15.380 align:middle line:84%
get jobs, find people you
want to have mates, et cetera

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and everything, simply
by being in your heart

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.350 align:middle line:84%
without ever leaving
your bedroom.

01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:23.620 align:middle line:90%


01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've done it so much now
that it's just like, wow,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:27.640 align:middle line:90%
why work?

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:28.280 align:middle line:90%
This is easy.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.651 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:29.651 --> 01:28:32.400 align:middle line:90%


01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it's
OK on top of that.

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:37.040 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.810 align:middle line:90%
It is your birthright.

01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:40.650 align:middle line:90%
You are a creator.

01:28:40.650 --> 01:28:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK to do it.

01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just that if you do
this way, which involves ego,

01:28:45.690 --> 01:28:46.710 align:middle line:90%
it's dangerous.

01:28:46.710 --> 01:28:48.070 align:middle line:90%
It's really dangerous.

01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Not only to you, but to
other people and everything.

01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:54.030 align:middle line:90%
This should be illegal.

01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:56.850 align:middle line:90%
It should not be used.

01:28:56.850 --> 01:28:59.810 align:middle line:90%
But it is a possibility.

01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:01.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why when they put
the secret out, I went,

01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, they're
going to emphasize this.

01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:05.220 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:09.000 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was really shocked.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.320 align:middle line:84%
We should make another DVD
on this so people understand.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.781 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:14.781 --> 01:29:17.216 align:middle line:90%


01:29:17.216 --> 01:29:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But I guess that's what we're
doing, kind of, right now.

01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:24.960 align:middle line:90%


01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think you
understand this and this.

01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:31.700 align:middle line:90%
But now we need to explain this.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And this little
piece right in here

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:39.930 align:middle line:84%
is what, traditionally,
in Hinduism is really

01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:44.480 align:middle line:84%
related to Kundalini yoga
and also to Korea yoga

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.150 align:middle line:90%
that Yogananda was teaching.

01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:49.210 align:middle line:90%
They're extremely related.

01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally,
to understand how

01:29:54.940 --> 01:30:00.010 align:middle line:84%
to do this last little piece
took 20, 30, or 40 years.

01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try
to translate this

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:05.120 align:middle line:84%
into modern day
words, and images,

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and understanding so that
you can do it now, today.

01:30:09.930 --> 01:30:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally, I've been
able to get about 30 to 40%.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, the rest
of you, it will just

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.250 align:middle line:90%
maybe take a little bit longer.

01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But you'll know exactly how to
do this before you leave here.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:23.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean exactly.

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Not kind of or
maybe or what it is.

01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to know
exactly how to do this.

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.330 align:middle line:90%
It's my job.

01:30:30.330 --> 01:30:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I hope I can do
this the best I can.

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try the best I can.

01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, I'll get
better and better at it.

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
take this one off.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:31:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put it
over the top of this one.

01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:01.675 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:01.675 --> 01:31:07.979 align:middle line:90%


01:31:07.979 --> 01:31:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're going
to come over to here.

01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's the tip of the
tongue and alpha waves.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just go through
the description of it first.

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll go through it
on images up here very clearly

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.990 align:middle line:84%
but just to give
you an overview.

01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm about to
say is nothing new,

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.750 align:middle line:84%
except in the way
that I'm saying it.

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:31.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's been around forever.

01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was talked
about in Vedas.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It's talked about in
Korean and Kundalini

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:43.870 align:middle line:84%
yoga for sure, and other
schools also in different ways.

01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:46.350 align:middle line:84%
The Great White Brotherhood
also taught this.

01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:48.952 align:middle line:90%


01:31:48.952 --> 01:31:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And Egyptian schools
also did, too.

01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they did in
China and other places also.

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:58.670 align:middle line:90%


01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And Japan also knows
all this information.

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:03.670 align:middle line:90%


01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:05.410 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they really know it.

01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But they've been
keeping it secret.

01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:12.220 align:middle line:84%
They told me-- a lot of the
Japanese don't know this--

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:16.290 align:middle line:84%
but there is a king and a
queen to the Shinto kept secret

01:32:16.290 --> 01:32:18.360 align:middle line:90%
and hidden.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But I had a meeting from
them through the emperor.

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we discussed
what we were discussing

01:32:25.650 --> 01:32:28.910 align:middle line:84%
was the sacred geometry
that was released.

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:31.530 align:middle line:90%
And they have all that geometry.

01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:32.450 align:middle line:90%
They know it all.

01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And they know all this stuff
that we're talking about.

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And their intention is to
release this information

01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to the Japanese people
at the right time.

01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that right time
would have happened by now.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.370 align:middle line:90%
But it still hasn't happened.

01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But they definitely
do know this.

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:59.070 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, here's a procedure.

01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the Merkaba
field is not there.

01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're about to
do is we're going to reverse.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So you guys are
coming backwards down.

01:33:06.150 --> 01:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
You're coming from the Merkaba
field to the beams of light.

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're coming
down into the heart

01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:13.790 align:middle line:90%
where we were in yesterday.

01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But normally, you start in the
heart and go the other way.

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Well that's what
we're going to do now.

01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've got
the beams of light,

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and we've got this other
stuff, and we're in the heart,

01:33:24.190 --> 01:33:28.650 align:middle line:84%
we're now going to go backwards,
which is forward actually.

01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
reconnect the heart back

01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to the brain and re-setup
the wiring inside of it

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:39.070 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't
function through ego.

01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And so how you do that is
you're-- and you have to first

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.110 align:middle line:84%
find the tiny place, which
we're going to do today.

01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:55.420 align:middle line:84%
When we do this one out
here out in the woods,

01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.890 align:middle line:84%
it'll be your first time
of going through it all.

01:33:57.890 --> 01:34:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So you're probably going to have
a lot of questions afterwards

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.110 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But I still wanted to get
your first time connected

01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:09.770 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth and everything.

01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:13.770 align:middle line:90%
It's just better.

01:34:13.770 --> 01:34:19.096 align:middle line:84%
And some of you will have
to practice this-- in fact,

01:34:19.096 --> 01:34:20.720 align:middle line:84%
almost all of you
will have to practice

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.970 align:middle line:90%
this-- to get good at it.

01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:26.020 align:middle line:90%
But OK, you got your Merkaba.

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You got your beams of light,
and you're in your heart.

01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're in the tiny
place of the heart.

01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:35.790 align:middle line:84%
What you then do is you're
watching the images.

01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And an image appears that your
emotional body responds to.

01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And you want this
image to be real.

01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Or you have created the
image through your intention.

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:52.925 align:middle line:84%
And now you want this
image to be real.

01:34:52.925 --> 01:34:56.260 align:middle line:90%
You want to bring it forth.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:59.990 align:middle line:84%
What you do is a
little complicated,

01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:01.990 align:middle line:90%
but this is the procedure.

01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:04.130 align:middle line:84%
You begin with the
tip of the tongue

01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:05.820 align:middle line:90%
on the roof of the mouth.

01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
specific place you rub it.

01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:12.930 align:middle line:84%
You could be rubbing it for
10 years in the wrong place,

01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:14.300 align:middle line:90%
and nothing will happen.

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:17.090 align:middle line:90%
And that happens all the time.

01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:19.650 align:middle line:90%
You got to be really precise.

01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go into
that in a moment.

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And next thing is, why
the tip of the tongue?

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we talked
about how creation of a baby

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:33.880 align:middle line:84%
begins with an ovum goes through
all those various steps we were

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.050 align:middle line:84%
talking about through
the star tetrahedron,

01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and then 512 cells that
forms a toroidal field.

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:42.220 align:middle line:90%
And then, it becomes a heart.

01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, we talked about how
the body came out of the heart.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.390 align:middle line:84%
What is the first thing
that comes out of the heart?

01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>The tongue.

01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:52.242 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, it could've been
the fingers, the brain,

01:35:52.242 --> 01:35:53.950 align:middle line:84%
or the legs, or
something else like that.

01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It's, literally, the
tongue is the first thing

01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:57.570 align:middle line:90%
that emerges out of the body.

01:35:57.570 --> 01:36:00.060 align:middle line:84%
This is scientifically
documented.

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.139 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

01:36:01.139 --> 01:36:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Is the first thing.

01:36:01.930 --> 01:36:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And so you can intuit
right from there

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that there's a link between
the tongue and the heart.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.507 align:middle line:90%
But it's more than that.

01:36:09.507 --> 01:36:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the
name of it right now,

01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
but there's a sack that
goes around the heart,

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
comes up here, comes
up through the throat,

01:36:18.130 --> 01:36:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and that sack ends
in your tongue.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a physiological
direct connection

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.340 align:middle line:84%
between the heart
and the tongue.

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:30.302 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an
arbitrary thing.

01:36:30.302 --> 01:36:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
study it, you'll

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:35.360 align:middle line:90%
see that this is really true.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when the tongue
is functioning--

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:41.750 align:middle line:84%
this is going to sound
strange-- the tongue

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:45.370 align:middle line:90%
actually becomes a penis.

01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:48.320 align:middle line:84%
The heart becomes male
rather than female.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And it turns the brain, which
is normally male, into female.

01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:55.120 align:middle line:90%
It reverses polarity.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And the, penis isn't
just going anywhere.

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.229 align:middle line:84%
On the roof of your
mouth is a vesica pisces,

01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:04.770 align:middle line:84%
which we'll show
you in a little bit.

01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:06.645 align:middle line:84%
And at the very back of
the roof of the mouth

01:37:06.645 --> 01:37:11.584 align:middle line:84%
in a very specific spot, you
have a clitoris, honest to God.

01:37:11.584 --> 01:37:13.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.930 align:middle line:84%
You might not know it because
it doesn't feel there.

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Now some people have a
hole at that exact spot.

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.390 align:middle line:84%
How many people have a hole
in the back of their mouth?

01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Just one person?

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:25.685 align:middle line:90%
It's usually more.

01:37:25.685 --> 01:37:27.485 align:middle line:90%
It's usually about eight or 9%.

01:37:27.485 --> 01:37:28.165 align:middle line:90%
>>Indented?

01:37:28.165 --> 01:37:28.664 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

01:37:28.664 --> 01:37:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Indented?

01:37:30.570 --> 01:37:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, it's either an indent
or an actual hole there.

01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>A hole or a valley?

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.684 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

01:37:35.684 --> 01:37:36.884 align:middle line:90%
>>A hole or a valley?

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Well it could be a valley.

01:37:38.050 --> 01:37:39.508 align:middle line:84%
But some people
have a hole so deep

01:37:39.508 --> 01:37:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that they can't
find the end of it.

01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It's where the
bones come together.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And they don't quite seal.

01:37:46.710 --> 01:37:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And that happens to be the exact
spot where, for other people,

01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.800 align:middle line:90%
there's a clitoris.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.487 align:middle line:84%
If you have an opening, you
do a slightly different thing.

01:37:55.487 --> 01:37:56.320 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about it.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But it would still
work just fine.

01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.890 align:middle line:90%


01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And for the rest of you,
it's flat there right now.

01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you take your
tongue, you know

01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:11.938 align:middle line:84%
when you make a clicking
sound like that?

01:38:11.938 --> 01:38:13.450 align:middle line:90%
[CLICKING SOUNDS]

01:38:13.450 --> 01:38:16.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, well now just
don't make the sound.

01:38:16.570 --> 01:38:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And only when you pull your
tongue in there, suck it.

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Pull the roof of the mouth down.

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Just don't make the sound,
but just pull it down.

01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And what'll happen is a
little bump will form.

01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Right, back there.

01:38:30.230 --> 01:38:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you start massaging
that bump, it swells up.

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's a clitoris.

01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Literally, it is a clitoris.

01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And after about 20 minutes,
it becomes really swollen.

01:38:46.150 --> 01:38:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally
excited, at that point.

01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But what that point is connected
to goes up through here,

01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and comes up, and is
directly connected

01:38:57.370 --> 01:38:59.090 align:middle line:90%
to the thalamus glands.

01:38:59.090 --> 01:39:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a gland, but
it's two pieces.

01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:03.055 align:middle line:84%
And it looks, kind
of, like eggs.

01:39:03.055 --> 01:39:06.250 align:middle line:90%
And they're, kind of, big.

01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is work that I
did with Dr. James Hardt.

01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:17.350 align:middle line:84%
He is a brain researcher,
Ph.D in physics,

01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:19.670 align:middle line:90%
and a Ph.D in psychology.

01:39:19.670 --> 01:39:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of the
primary researchers

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:28.140 align:middle line:90%
in the world for brains.

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this guy knows
more about brains

01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:32.720 align:middle line:90%
than just about anybody alive.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's up in Canada
in British Columbia.

01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But he's building
these things that I'm

01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:41.970 align:middle line:84%
about to talk about all
over the world right now.

01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:43.769 align:middle line:84%
They just finished one
in Germany, I think.

01:39:43.769 --> 01:39:45.060 align:middle line:90%
They're building one in Russia.

01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:47.600 align:middle line:90%


01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Dr. James Hardt.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.100 align:middle line:90%
H-A-R-D-T. He's German.

01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Where's the bump
located [INAUDIBLE]?

01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Where's the bump located?

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:58.445 align:middle line:90%
>>Where's the what located?

01:39:58.445 --> 01:39:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>The bump [INAUDIBLE].

01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, the bump.

01:40:00.650 --> 01:40:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just give
you an overview first.

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll go in detail and
tell you exactly where it is,

01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:08.580 align:middle line:90%
and describe it precisely.

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just giving
an overview right now.

01:40:10.810 --> 01:40:16.570 align:middle line:90%


01:40:16.570 --> 01:40:17.766 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:40:17.766 --> 01:40:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>It's 11:00.

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, it's 11 o'clock.

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And we're right at the clitoris.

01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.449 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:24.449 --> 01:40:28.886 align:middle line:90%


01:40:28.886 --> 01:40:30.365 align:middle line:90%
>>Keep going!

01:40:30.365 --> 01:40:32.337 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:32.337 --> 01:40:39.239 align:middle line:90%


01:40:39.239 --> 01:40:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh God, that's horrible.

01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:43.108 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:43.108 --> 01:40:46.259 align:middle line:90%


01:40:46.259 --> 01:40:46.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.380 align:middle line:90%
That was Diane though.

01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:50.535 align:middle line:90%
She's the mommy.

01:40:50.535 --> 01:40:51.792 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:51.792 --> 01:40:55.090 align:middle line:90%


01:40:55.090 --> 01:40:57.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, well I still needed almost
a half an hour to do this.

01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:01.040 align:middle line:90%
So let's take the break.

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And just stay excited.

01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:06.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And we'll be back at 11:30.

01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:28.600 align:middle line:90%
