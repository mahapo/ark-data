00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Relationships are a beautiful
opportunity to experience

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:84%
the divine feminine
and masculine.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Many of my clients,
they love to always ask

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
about how to unite with
their divine masculine

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
or, if they're
already partnered,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
how to be in more sacred union
with the partner that they have.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've been helping women
for so many years manifest

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:90%
their divine masculine soulmate.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And my secret is that
even though initially they

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
come to manifest
the man, once I'm

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
done with them, what
actually happens

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:90%
is they become the goddess.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So the goddess says,
desire your beloved.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:84%
We are always celebrated
in all of our desires,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
including for love, sexual
union, intimacy, a lover.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But what is so magical
and powerful and beautiful

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:84%
is that whether we
are seeking love,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:84%
whether we are in love
and in partnership,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the sacred
union of the divine feminine

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and masculine.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:10%
Whether we call
them god or goddess

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:10%
within me or my feminine
masculine energy

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:10%
is actually coming
into wholeness.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:10%
So my beloved and I,
we're in sacred union.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we're asked
what the secret is,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
we both truly believe that
it's that when we were single,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
we were on our own path,
equally focused on devoted

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to cultivating and uniting the
feminine masculine within us.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:84%
For me, a lot of this did
involve taking back my power,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:90%
as I shared.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And for my beloved,
it was coming

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:84%
into his masculine but also
his heart, opening his heart.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So when we come
into relationships,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
they give us a beautiful
opportunity, especially when

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:84%
we've taken that time to
unite the divine feminine and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:90%
masculine within us.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
When that comes
together in partnership,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
you get to experience
its expression

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:90%
through another human soul.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the
most sacred experiences

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:90%
that we can have.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
But it begins by
uniting the god goddess,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
the divine feminine
masculine within us first.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
One thing that us as women can
experience a lot of difficulty

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.270 align:middle line:84%
with and resistance is
actually fully embracing

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
our divine feminine
sexuality and sensuality.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And there's so many reasons.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Women's sexuality has been
in many ways dictated to us

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:90%
by the masculine.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And so we've lost
that connection

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:10%
to what it means to actually
own our sexuality, our bodies

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:10%
as ours to relish it as sacred,
releasing shame, releasing guilt

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:10%
around the experience of
pleasure, voicing our desires,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:10%
our needs to our lovers,
and being at home.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Even our relationship to
our bodies, the pressures

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
that we have on
looking a certain way,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
it can disconnect
us from remembering

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies are the temple
of the goddess that we inhabit.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
This is where it can be
so helpful to learn about,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:90%
to reconnect with the goddesses.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Goddesses of sexuality--
they are always also

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:90%
goddesses of love.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:10%
So in all cultures, when we have
goddesses-- the Oshun, Hathor,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:10%
Aphrodite, Parvati--

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:10%
from all names and
cultures of sexuality,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:10%
they are also goddesses of love.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And first and foremost,
this is self-love.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:90%
So what is so healing--

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
what I love seeing
women come home to

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
is in their journeys
of reclaiming

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
their sexuality, sexual
pleasure, sexual union,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:84%
it as much becomes
a journey of coming

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
into your power and true
self-love, self-acceptance,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
loving your body not
just as it is, but wow,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
my body is a temple
of the goddess that

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
deserves to be relished
and appreciated by me

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:90%
and ravished by my lover.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So the standards just
go so high that we're

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
only available for the most
sacred and beautiful experience

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:84%
of our sexuality with
ourselves and with whoever

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:90%
we choose to share that with.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But another issue is
that we are tired.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:84%
We women with all
the demands, the way

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:84%
that the world is set
up, it doesn't entirely

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
support women to be rested
and nourished and sensual

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
because, especially
in the Western world,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:90%
it's so fast paced.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:90%
It's so go, go, go.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's so empowering
for us as women

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
when we reconnect to
our sensuality, when

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
we give ourselves permission to
slow down, to be in our bodies,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledge if we feel that
we are in hyper masculine mode

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
but also sometimes even
in extreme feminine mode.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So the feminine
out of balance can

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
be the archetype of the
martyr, where we are fixing

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:90%
everyone else's problems.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:90%
We're overgiving.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
We're putting
everyone else first.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I come with lineage of
feminine, a lot of martyrdom

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:90%
and sacrifice.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I had decided that
will not be my path.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So I've set up my life
to be very feminine.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And what that means for
me is that whether it's

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
in motherhood, as a leader
in my business, as a wife,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:84%
as a daughter, as a friend, in
all my multiple roles that all

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
of us play, women play,
we do get to be nourished.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And the divine masculine can
help us, especially as women,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
to prioritize, create
the discipline,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
the actual masculine level
scheduling of self-care time,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
support systems, structures
in place for the feminine

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
to be sensual, to have
time for self-care,

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
for pleasure, for
rest, for enjoyment.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I actually find
the beautiful masculine can

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
really support us
in being sensual.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a shift
from being in hyper

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
masculine or hyper
feminine mode to come

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.660 align:middle line:90%
into that beautiful balance.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Where we find
ourselves right now

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:84%
is a really interesting
time because we

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
have been in a male-dominant
world for so long.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:90%
But the goddess is returning.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that is because
we are realizing the imbalance

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
that it's created on our
planet, in our collective,

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:90%
and how we treat each other.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And then on a very
personal level, especially

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
for us who are
disconnected to nature,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:90%
we're in hyper masculine mode.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:90%
There's a healthy masculine.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:90%
But we've gone way beyond that.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no slowing down.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Success is measured on what
we have and what we accomplish

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and how fast we're
going and how much we're

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:90%
acquiring and accomplishing.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But it disconnects us
to that divine feminine

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
of like slowing down, of
relishing, of appreciating,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:90%
of enjoying, of sharing.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
We're just doing and
we are forgetting

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
the being part, which the
feminine invites all of us

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:90%
to come back to.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's just on a
very personal level.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of the
imbalances that we

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
see on our Earth in
everything that's

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
happening so that
the few can stay

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
in power at the expense of
exploiting everybody else,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
this is where coming back and
bringing more of the feminine,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
whether we want to
come into our hearts

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and move away from
so much competition,

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
into collaboration, into
community, into caring

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:90%
and compassion.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.790 align:middle line:84%
If all of us come more
into that heart space,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
the divine feminine,
the lotus of the heart--

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
sharing and caring,
that's just a start for us

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to heal and hopefully
even evolve together.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:90%
So we aren't trying to fight.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fight.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:90%
We are in this together.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm sometimes asked, how
do we fight these systems?

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:90%
How do we fight the patriarchy?

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And an answer that
seemed most helpful

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is that, how about we shift
the focus from taking back

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
our own power as women
when we focus on reclaiming

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
our full divine feminine
power and being sovereign

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.330 align:middle line:84%
in everything, our sexuality,
our warrior goddess

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
energy, our receptivity,
our radiance, our abundance,

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
feminine energy is the
highest good of all.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:90%
It's abundance.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It's family.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:90%
It's community.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:90%
It's intimacy.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:90%
It's love.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:90%
It's support.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:90%
It's nourishment.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:90%
The rise of that is what heals.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And as we are rising as women
and taking responsibility

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.580 align:middle line:84%
for reclaiming our own
divine feminine power,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:84%
the divine masculine is
rising alongside of us.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
approach that I find

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
is a lot more empowering
for all sides.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It's time now.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
We have this opportunity to make
a shift in the world as it is.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:84%
So as an example,
one of my clients--

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:84%
highly successful businesswoman,
ran her own business.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:10%
And in my goddess
mystery school training,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:10%
there's an initiation where
it's all about feminine cycles,

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:10%
honoring your cycles.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:10%
And she was shocked
to realize that when

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:10%
she started designing her life
in a more feminine way-- so very

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:10%
busy, successful business.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But she decided she's going to
take the first day of her period

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is something,
as women, if we

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
can do for ourselves, if we
are in our menstruating years,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
taking our first full
menstrual day to slow down,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
ideally off of work, or
just giving ourselves

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:90%
some time to rest.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
What she found was that she
had her highest income month

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
when she started that practice
and just started delegating

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and, again, bringing in some of
that divine masculine support.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So even in the
world that we're in,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.430 align:middle line:84%
we can make choices where
we bring in the masculine

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.750 align:middle line:84%
to support us instead of trying
to be in hyper masculine mode

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and keep going and then
letting the masculine support

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:84%
us in a way, whether it's
through delegating, creating

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:84%
more systems, structures,
support for ourselves so that we

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:84%
can rest more, so we can take
either the period day off

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:90%
or time for rest.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I've been taking Fridays off
since I began my business

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:90%
in 2012 as my goddess day.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it's
important to acknowledge

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
that the structures
of the world, it's

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:90%
not just that it's our choices.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:10%
The way the world and corporate
structures are designed

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:10%
is that you're rewarded
for how hard you work,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:10%
how long you work, how much you
over give, how much you strive,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:10%
how much you hustle.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
But the feminine way that
we are beginning to create

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:84%
is boundary setting
is really prioritizing

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:90%
self-care, wellness for all.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And studies show it actually
increases productivity

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
when employers support
more rest, meditation

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:90%
room in the workplace.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It's challenging in the
times that we're in.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But we have this opportunity
now to begin to take a stand,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:90%
to push back.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.485 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was
in the corporate world,

00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:90%
it was a very tumultuous place.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:84%
You could not talk
back to the boss.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And when he demanded that I be
on call to take the laptop home,

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
be on the cell phone till 10:00
PM, seven nights a week, I said,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I will be here 100%
for my 9:00 to 5:00.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But after that, when I
log off, I'm in my life.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And everyone said,
did he fire you?

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And somehow, he kept me.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, I think it
made him respect me more.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:90%
But I pushed back.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's not easy.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
warrior goddess

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:84%
energy, the Lilith
archetype, you

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
can't be afraid of saying no
and of the consequence of that.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when I was forced
to exit the corporate world

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
for many reasons
and pushing back,

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:00.020 align:middle line:84%
that's how I ended up
creating my business, which

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
is based on freedom and the
flourishing of the feminine.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
that it's easy.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It has its challenges,
the world, the way

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:90%
that it is right now.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But we have a responsibility
to ourselves to be true

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and to live our most flourishing
lives and to create them.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.522 align:middle line:84%
And to bring all
of this together,

00:13:23.522 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
beautiful things we

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:84%
can do to remember
the divine feminine

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all,
to know that she--

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful energy, this
power is within us and all

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And because the feminine is so
accessible to us in our bodies,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:90%
in nature, she loves ritual.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So a really simple way is to
bring her into our every day.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And this can be as simple as
a ritual of when we wake up,

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:84%
connecting to our
soul, connecting

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:84%
to the wisdom of the
universe, of spirit, of god

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:90%
goddess, whoever we connect to.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It can be as simple as a prayer.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into the
busyness of our day,

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
the first thing we do is just
take a moment to be still,

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:90%
to slow down, to pause.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
One practice I know that they
love to do throughout the day

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
is taking moments throughout
the day to come into your body.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Because in our day, we're going
to be very much in our heads.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So the feminine asks us,
just come into your body.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And a very simple practice
is bringing our hands

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:90%
on our hearts.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
We can go from the head, the
thinking, the doing, the task,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
the busyness, all of
that into our heart,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe even feeling our
breath and our heartbeat.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And then if we really find that
we're too much in our head,

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:84%
bringing our energy or
focus into our bodies,

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:84%
placing our hands on our sacral
chakra for us women on our womb

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and even down to our feet
and feeling the earth.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:84%
These are practices
we can do every day.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't need anything
outside of us.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many
other beautiful practices,

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:84%
like lighting incense,
practicing a goddess mantra.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:84%
There are male
monks, Buddhist monks

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
who love to chant
the goddess Kuan Yin

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
mantra to experience inner peace
and wish enlightenment and peace

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:90%
for all beings everywhere.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So there are so many ways to
revere and feel and become

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.136 align:middle line:84%
one with the divine feminine
through simple daily practices.

00:15:39.136 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The goddess, in one of
her most revered names,

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
is known as the goddess
of 10,000 names.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is that when we
embody the divine feminine,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
we become not only healed
and whole ourselves.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, what the divine
feminine also desires to be

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:10%
is a vessel and a channel
of miracles and abundance

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:10%
and blessings for the highest
good of all for all beings

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:10%
everywhere--

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:26.100 align:middle line:10%
Mother Kuan Yin, Mother Mary,
Mother Isis, in all her names.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:84%
It serves all of humanity
for us to heal ourselves,

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:84%
for us to become whole, and for
us to unapologetically allow

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to flourish in
every way in our Earth life

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, sexually,
essentially, abundantly.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's this ripple,
this ocean of blessings

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:90%
that ripples out to all.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
the goddess is within.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So like Lakshmi, the
goddess is the source.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And what truly happens is
when women work with me,

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, yes, I manifested
my dreams and all these desires

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:90%
that I had.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
But the greatest gift
that I experienced was I

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.520 align:middle line:84%
feel that I came home to
god goddess within me.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, that
is what coming home

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
to the divine feminine is, is
that we are one with the source.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're no longer looking
outside of our life

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and ourselves for anything,
for anyone to heal us,

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:90%
to complete us, to validate us.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But we are one
with our divinity.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
connected to source,

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:84%
we become a channel for our
light and all these blessings

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.440 align:middle line:84%
to flow through us and overflow
to all beings everywhere.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm so happy to lead
us through a gentle, guided

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:84%
meditation to connect with
our divine feminine energies

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
through our seven chakras
or energy centers.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you'd like to join
me, get comfortable.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Take any seated posture, where
your body is most comfortable.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Rest your hands.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.136 align:middle line:84%
And gently bring your
awareness to your breathing.

00:18:27.136 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Not trying to breathe
in any particular way

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.063 align:middle line:90%
but just letting yourself be.

00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And setting your intention
to connect with the divine

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:90%
feminine within you.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Gently bringing your
awareness to your root,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:84%
which is at the
base of your spine.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And visualizing or
sensing that there

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
are roots growing from the base
of your spine through your legs,

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:11.205 align:middle line:84%
through the soles of your
feet, down through the ground,

00:19:11.205 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
through the earth, through the
heart of Mother Earth, known

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:84%
as Gaia, as Pachamama,
as our Earth Mother.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Feeling her feminine
power, also called her

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Shakti, her life force.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Feeling it at the core
radiating at her center.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And she sends this as a
gift through your roots,

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:84%
rising up from her center
through your roots,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
up through your feet,
your legs, and igniting

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:90%
the base of your spine.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:90%
You feel that connection.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Your breath has softened.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, you have
become grounded.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:84%
You are in your body,
rooted, energized,

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and feeling that
divine feminine energy

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
at the base of your spine of
nourishment for Mother Earth,

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:21.154 align:middle line:84%
of safety and security
and support and abundance.

00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Breathe out.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Bringing your awareness
to your sacral chakra

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:90%
just below your belly.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
If you want to even
place your hands here,

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
feeling your vitality,
your sensuality,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:84%

your connection to pleasure.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:84%

Radiance, creativity,
receptivity, flow.

00:21:32.022 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
If you feel called, the
sound here of the goddess

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:84%
of the divine feminine is "ah",
the sound of pleasure and joy.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.066 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling with the (SIGHS) ahhh.

00:21:47.066 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:90%

Beautiful.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And bringing your hands to
your belly, your solar plexus.

Letting it shine
like a radiant sun.

Empowered.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:10%
Strong with clear will, clear

You have the right to shine.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You are centered in your radiant

00:22:42.585 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
If you wish to place

connecting to your emotions.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're feeling
right now, honoring it.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:84%
The goddesses use words
of power to manifest.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So feeling the power of
your voice and your truth.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%

00:24:26.706 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Allowing yourself to
slow down, to get quiet.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And receive and follow and
trust your intuitive messages,

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:84%

Breathing out.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And bringing awareness to
your crown, to the goddess,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:90%
to heaven, to light.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Opening to your oneness
with all of life

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and the remembrance
that you are here

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
to create your most
flourishing life

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and to birth heaven
on earth, to be

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
a channel of
miracles for yourself

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:90%
and for the highest good of all.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you wish to seal this
by bringing your palms together

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:84%
in front of your heart,
thanking yourself

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:84%
for trusting, for
taking this journey

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the divine and
especially the divine feminine

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and letting its magic
flow through you

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of your day.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Breathing out.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:90%
