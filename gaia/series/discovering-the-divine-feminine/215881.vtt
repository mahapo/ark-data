I'm a divine feminine expert

and author.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:84%
This path was maybe
not the likely one

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
for me growing up in a very
religious upbringing where

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
the feminine was so oppressed,
was denied, was even punished

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and condemned.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So I have come onto this path
through my own life journey

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
of reclaiming my divine
feminine power, of embarking

on this journey of deep healing
with the goddesses that started

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
for me at the age of
13 because of having

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:84%
to heal a lot of
childhood traumas

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
that created post-traumatic
stress disorder, so much

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:90%
spiritually, and emotionally.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And even while I was so
blessed to have access

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to therapy in my high
school, it required

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
for me learning
about coming home to

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and healing with the
divine feminine in order

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
to release, heal, and
alchemize all my past pain,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
to reclaim my power
and to liberate myself,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to let those old identities
die and allow myself

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
to be rebirthed into my
truth, into my full power,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
into the full spectrum of
my divine feminine gifts.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
That ended up not only
transforming myself first,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
but they empowered me
to transform my life,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:84%
to clear patterns that
were in my especially

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%

generations, and to birth

a whole new way of being a woman
in the world and in my family

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Because of the traumas that
I experienced, specifically,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately with
the masculine,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
this was during some
years in my childhood

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:90%
when we were in Pakistan.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I was born and
raised mostly in Canada.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And the trauma showed
up for me as deep fear,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:90%
being scared all the time.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:84%
I internalized the guilt, like
I was wrong and I was faulty.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It was just a complete fear of
the masculine on every level.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And so just as a woman, for
me to come into wholeness,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
it required that I learn about,
remember the divine feminine.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a path of healing
and transformation,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and the divine feminine alchemy
is not afraid of the dark.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And the darkness
for me was actually

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging the rage
that I experienced

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
or that was in response and
giving myself space, rituals,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:84%
permission to feel
the full grief,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
to release eventually
that guilt and shame.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And I met what we call the
power of the dark goddess,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
truly got to see the
power in facing my pain.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And what was so beautiful
was feeling held and safe

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
in this space with
the divine feminine,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:84%
with the goddesses, with
the dark goddesses of what

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
we will call the
underworld, which is really

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:84%
our own subconscious and
those shadow parts of us

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that we can be really
afraid to face.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like
Kuan Yin, Mother Mary,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:90%
these goddesses of forgiveness.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
That was the purification
part of releasing

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:90%
the pain, of cleansing it away.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:10%
And as part of the
healing on the other side,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:10%
going from the darkness
into the light,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:10%
it was embodying Aphrodite,
Hathor, Osun, these goddesses

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:10%
who are goddesses
of the body temple

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:10%
and remind us women that our
sexuality, our bodies are ours.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And reclaiming that for myself,
releasing all the experience

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that was exploitative
and abusive for me,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and coming to the holiness
and the sovereignty

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
of my body, my sexuality, my
power as mine that I took back

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
was so healing for me, first
as a woman and then also,

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
eventually, in healing
with the masculine,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
being only available to the
healthy masculine in my life

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and manifesting and receiving
my beautiful husband who

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:84%
is the embodiment of the
enlightened, awakened,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
heart-centered,
healthy masculine.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sad that
those things happened

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
for me and for all women
who experienced that,

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, I'm
really grateful for the way

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
that it helped me
to come into a place

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
of so much feminine
empowerment in my body

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:90%
and my heart and my soul.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So it was this beautiful journey
of meeting this full range

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
of feminine power that I
connected through as goddesses

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:90%
on my journey that helped me.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was so life
changing and so powerful.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.080 align:middle line:84%
It became a devotional path and
a way of being, not just living,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:84%
but being for me that
ended up becoming

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:90%
a way of teaching and serving.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And so now I get to teach the
ways of ancient, timeless,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Especially when we go
through trauma in our life,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
energetically, it stays in us.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
For me, I felt this on a very
energetically cellular level.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Especially as a woman, our
wombs, they're like sponges.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:90%
It soaked up all that pain.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't matter
what we have been through,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
what the divine feminine
offers all of us

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is wisdom, gift,
tools, and practices

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:84%
to heal through anything and
not just heal through it,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
but through what I have learned,
what I have lived and practiced

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and teach, the process of
divine feminine alchemy,

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
where we go through
the phases of the death

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.690 align:middle line:90%
of our old identities.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Truly facing our pain.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of beautiful masculine
teachings and healing practices,

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
as an example, they will
teach us to observe our pain,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
but they'll remind us that
you're not your emotion,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
you're not your past,
you're not your experience.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And so just detach from it,
and we distance ourselves.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And if that helps
us, that's beautiful.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But what I have found, and this
could be helpful for all of us,

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the feminine,
as an example,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
in the healing process,
especially, she grieves with us.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:90%
She lets us fall apart.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:84%
She lets us descend into
the rock bottom, deepest,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
darkest depths of the
underworld where we are just,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
as goddess Inanna was in
her story, naked and raw

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:90%
and bowed low.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And there she will
grieve with us.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And what happens here
is for all of us,

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in our healing journey with the
feminine, is full permission.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't just observe.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:84%
You feel everything
to the fullest.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:90%
You process it.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And the other tool in
practice, the feminine

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:84%
offers us specifically
around healing is somatic.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:90%
It's body.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It's processing and releasing
the emotional trauma,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
the trapped energy
in physical ways.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So part of this for
me and my journey

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
involves, when I was doing
a lot of healing work,

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:84%
physically shaking out, creating
a safe and sacred space for me

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
to rage, to cry, to
scream, and to know

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that that was safe and sacred
and necessary for my healing.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:84%
The divine feminine
can take us when

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
we learn the journey of
divine feminine alchemy

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to not run away from our
trauma, not detach from it,

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:90%
but to actually be in its fires.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And in its fires,
we are rebirthed.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a myth of the phoenix
that rises from her own ashes.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:10%
And there's a Hawaiian
goddess, the goddess Pele

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:10%
who is the volcano.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, I think
of the feminine offering

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:84%
as healing with the
fires that purify us.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, when
the lava cools, it

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:84%
becomes a fertile,
rich, black soil

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
for the beautiful Hawaiian,
Polynesian islands

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:90%
to be birthed.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I have found in
my journey and what

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I guide women through is
that, actually, through facing

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
the deepest depths and being in
the fires of our pain, our rage,

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
our grief, through
a beautiful process,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
we come out on the other
side cleansed and rebirthed.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So the physical
rituals of actually,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:25.510 align:middle line:84%
whether it was crying or raging,
dancing, shaking, releasing,

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it was a physical
ritual, like writing all

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:84%
my emotions, very raw to
a person who had abused me

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and just writing everything
unfiltered, swearing, raging.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.225 align:middle line:84%
Here there was no
graceful forgiveness.

00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Give the other cheek.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:90%
It was like, ugh!

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And just being very
honest because the goddess

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
gives us that permission,
the dark goddess.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And then burning that letter
and burning sacred herbs

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and playing primal
music like drums.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Letting all that
out, I could feel

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the past
releasing from my body.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I would, as an example,
part of a healing ritual,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
just lay on the Earth
and let everything settle

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and reintegrate, and then
maybe take a bath with sea salt

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and rose oil and special oils
with an Aphrodisian statue

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:90%
and goddess chants.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And that was replenishing.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we release,
then we open space,

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:90%
and we want to replenish.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So then it was like
filling myself up

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
with the radiance and the
beauty and the sensuality

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:90%
of the goddess.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So it required for me
and for all the women

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:84%
that I work with,
we especially need--

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:84%
we're very physical,
sensual beings.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And the goddesses, the divine
feminine wisdom offers all of us

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
these rituals to process,
to heal, to renew,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
to rebirth on a very
physical level that

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
can be so life changing
and transformational.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And through this rebirth, we
not only take our power back,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:84%
but all our wounding,
it gets alchemized

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
into our wisdom, our growth,
our evolution, our power.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And like goddess Inanna
herself, who rises and becomes

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
the rebirth queen
of Earth and heaven,

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
we take our traumas, our wounds,
our past, and alchemize them

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:84%
into a new beginning
for ourselves,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
rooted in the foundation of
our wisdom and our power.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Something that's
very powerful and fun

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
about being in feminine
energy is that the way

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that it balances the masculine,
the masculine loves knowledge,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:90%
to learn, and to know.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
That's its beautiful gift
around masculine wisdom.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But the feminine what she says,
OK, now you know this, now let's

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.860 align:middle line:90%
be it.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So she invites us to
take our knowledge

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and to become it through
embodiment, through practice.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, we can
learn about being present.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.810 align:middle line:84%
We can read all the books around
being more present and grounded.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:84%
The feminine says, let's
go take a walk in nature.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's take your shoes off.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's feel the grass.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's smell.

What she does, on
a very simple way

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the embodiment
experience of the feminine,

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:90%
is coming into our five senses.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's your coffee,

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
we already do, and to smell,
touch, taste, fully experience

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:84%
everything and to go from
the head into the senses,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:90%
into the body into being.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get to
experience the feminine and life

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:84%
at its fullest, which the
goddess, the divine feminine

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
celebrates, instead of
just keeping it up here.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It just shifts the
energy from our heads

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:84%
into our hearts and our
bodies and our life.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the misconceptions
with feminine energy

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:84%
is that it's so soft
that it can be passive.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So because it's thought
that the masculine energy is

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
the active and dynamic
one, so the misconception

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:84%
is that what balances that is
feminine energy that's passive.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:90%
But actually, it's not passive.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:90%
It is receptive.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, also, feminine
energy is dynamic and active.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:90%
She's a cycle.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So whereas masculine energy can
be more like waves, or linear,

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:90%
the feminine energy is cyclical.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And part of her
cycle is creation.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
We look at Mother
Earth, and she has

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
her seasons where she
is in spring, where

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.820 align:middle line:90%
she's in summer, fall, winter.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So receptivity is
not being passive.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It's allowing ourselves to
become still to slow down

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:90%
long enough to receive.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, receptivity
can be like intuition.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:90%
You get that aha moment.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Or if we're, let's say too
much in our masculine energy,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:84%
we are trying to
figure something out,

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
problem solve, make our
list, pros and cons,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:90%
and we can just feel stuck.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we've all had
that moment where we just

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
let go, took a
break, took a walk,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
took a shower, played with
our dog, got some fresh air,

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and then, suddenly, ah,
we have that aha moment.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So that, we may say, was we
were in our feminine energy.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
We weren't being
passive, but simply

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
by giving ourselves
permission to slow down,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:90%
we received that aha.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So receptive energy is actually
very magical, and all of us

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:90%
get to access that.

and the divine masculine in us.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to share
for us to understand

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:84%
how these beautiful energies
can unite together however we

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:90%
identify-- it's beyond gender.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So the divine
feminine, I'll take us

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:84%
through a journey of
our energy centers

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.720 align:middle line:90%
because it's so multifaceted.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:10%
So at the root level,
the divine feminine

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:10%
is our connection to the earth.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
We call that force Shakti,
and the divine masculine force

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:90%
is Prana.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And really, this is
our life force energy

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that we all connect to by
our connection to the Earth,

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
by being present
here in our life,

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and even on a very
practical level,

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
feeling our feet
connected to the Earth

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and feeling that we are
one with this life force

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:84%
that animates all things,
that takes the formless

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and brings it into form, that
brings life into everything.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:10%
Then as we move up
into what we call

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:10%
the sacral chakra,
this energy center,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:10%
the feminine energy is
fertility, creativity, pleasure,

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:10%
receptivity.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:90%
And masculine energy is also--

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
it's more penetrative,
shall we say.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:90%
So the feminine is a chalice.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:84%
She receives, she
calls in, she draws in.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And the masculine, shall we
say, is like this wand energy.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It's also very potent and
creative, but it's more--

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
it's a more focused,
creative energy.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine is like
this more flowy dance,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:90%
creative energy.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
When we come up to
the solar plexus,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.380 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
masculine can actually

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:90%
be very naturally centered.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:90%
So this is our power.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I find,
especially working with women,

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
is actually an area that we need
to hone in and cultivate more,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:90%
the connection to our power.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is our inner sun.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Many cultures
identify the masculine

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.547 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of the sun,
the feminine with the energy

00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:90%
of the moon and the Earth.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:10%
But we all have this energy,
and that is radiance, regalness

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:10%
and will and creation.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And that divine masculine
energy, it's the noble warrior.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
It's being triumphant,
persistent, and persevering.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:10%
And when we get to the
heart, the feminine/masculine

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:10%
meet as our love, gratitude,
wisdom, and faith at our throat.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:10%
This is our expression.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:10%
It's inspiration,
beauty, expression.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And at our third eye, feminine
is like the intuition.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the masculine would
be the focus and the discipline

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:90%
to stay single-pointed focus.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So together, they create magic,
the feminine/masculine energies.

And then finally, when
we come to the top,

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
the feminine actually can be
both heavenly enlightenment

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and all the beauty
and riches of heaven.

magical about the feminine

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:90%
is she's like the womb.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:84%
There are goddesses who are
the void and nothingness,

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:90%
pure stillness, pure silence.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
This is where we access through
that quiet and solitude,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:90%
intuition.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And with the divine masculine,
it's god, it's heaven,

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
it's enlightenment, it's
liberation, it's moksha,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.620 align:middle line:84%
it's spiritual
illumination and wisdom.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So we get to celebrate
and honor and embrace

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:84%
both of these energies dancing
through us in sacred union.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.622 align:middle line:90%
[PIANO]

00:18:49.622 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.580 align:middle line:90%
The divine feminine has--

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:90%
it's here.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:90%
It's always been here.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And since ancient, primitive
times, our most ancient statues,

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
carvings in caves honor
the life force, the power

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
of the divine feminine,
especially when we were deeply

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
connected to nature in all
of her cycles in our life,

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
our livelihood
depended on nature.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And until today, through
Indigenous cultures,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:84%
through some of the
major religions,

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:90%
the divine feminine is present.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
She's always there
and always accessible,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through the earth,
whether it's as a goddess,

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
whether she's providing
blessings of abundance

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
or enlightenment, awakening
all over the world

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:90%
and also inside of us.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I say the queendom of heaven
or the goddess is within us.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:84%
She's been around and one of the
ways to really connect with her

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and honor her is
there's this archetype

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
of the triple goddess,
the maiden, the mother,

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:90%
and the crone.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:10%
And within that, she is
present through all cultures

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:10%
in some form, in some
name, in some way.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
As an example, in the
maiden, she is spring.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We can say spring is
the goddess in nature.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:90%
She is Hathor in ancient Egypt.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:10%
She is our celebration
of the feminine energy

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:10%
of sensuality, fertility,
creativity, inspiration, beauty.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:10%
But also what's very
beautiful, goddesses

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:10%
have been revered in the
maiden form as virgins.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So goddesses like Athena,
Artemis, the virgin archetype

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:84%
is a celebration not as much
about a woman's sexuality

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:46.830 align:middle line:84%
as much as her wholeness, that
this is a woman who is virginal.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:84%
She is whole and
complete unto herself.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So the goddess is
very multidimensional,

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and she is celebrated through
all cultures and traditions,

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
even within a
singular archetype,

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:90%
in very multifaceted ways.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And the mother archetype
is a celebration

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
of physical motherhood, of womb,
of ovulation, of the full moon,

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:90%
of summer, of abundance.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And she's also the celebration
of the feminine life

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
force of creation,
manifestation, generosity.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we come
to the dark goddess,

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
the crone archetype,
this archetypal energy

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is the energy of winter,
of the waning moon,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:84%
of darkness, of
retreat, of silence.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:90%
And it can be so multilayered.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have also the warrior,
the rebellious Lilith archetype,

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.180 align:middle line:84%
the dark goddess,
the woman who is free

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and liberated, the high
priestess, the magician,

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:90%
the sorceress, the witch.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
It's so rich that,
even within something

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%
like the triple
goddess archetype,

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:84%
all cultures and traditions have
feminine energy and gifts that

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
are celebrated in a
very multifaceted way.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So how we can celebrate
and embrace and receive

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
from the divine
feminine is to remember

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:90%
that she is the full spectrum.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So one way that we can look
at this is the three realms.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
There's the realm, the
goddess of the underworld.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.940 align:middle line:90%
This is our darkness.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:90%
This is embracing sacred rage.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:84%
This is healing our
traumas and grief.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
This is facing the darkest
depths of our shadow,

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:84%
of our subconscious,
of really being

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:84%
guided by the queens
of the underworld.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
They're called in other
traditions the queens

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
or the goddesses of
death and the underworld.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And so knowing that
even the darkest parts

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:84%
of our psyche, our lives are
sacred, then the realm of earth,

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:84%
the goddess celebrates
everything that is earthly.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
All the beauty of earthly
life, from our sexuality,

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
our sensuality to luxury
to art and poetry and food.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The goddess is found in all
the pleasures and the abundance

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and beauty of our bodies
and of our earthly life.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is the realm of
the goddesses of the Earth,

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:90%
of Mother Earth.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, the
spectrum of heaven,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:84%
queens of heaven,
mother of heaven.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:90%
This is our spirituality.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:84%
This is our oneness
with all of life.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
This is our divine wisdom,
our enlightenment, our power

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and create and
birth miracles, manifestations,

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:90%
from the formless into form.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's really beautiful
when we remember and reclaim

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:84%
all the different realms
and the full spectrum

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:90%
of the divine feminine.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
important to remember

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that talking about
the divine feminine

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
is a celebration of the energy,
the life force, the wisdom,

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and the power of the feminine
that we all have within us.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
We're not separate from the
goddess or the divine feminine.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
This energy, this power,
this life force, the wisdom,

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:90%
all its magic is who we are.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's part of us.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:90%
It's inside of us.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So if we can shift away from
that criticism of the feminine

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.200 align:middle line:84%
into just realizing that we
are one with this life force,

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and if we can embrace
this, we actually

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:40.410 align:middle line:84%
open ourselves to all
of its magic and gifts.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:90%
[SPIRITUAL MUSIC]

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:84%
The feminine is so
powerful in all her aspects

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:84%
that, sometimes, we can be
afraid to fully embrace her.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Even while she is revered and
worshipped on a human level,

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
we can still be afraid,
whether it's men being afraid

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine power
or women being afraid

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:90%
of their own feminine power.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And the fear can
be when we are not

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:84%
connected to our own truth
and our own inherent power,

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.020 align:middle line:84%
then anything that we
perceive as a threat to that,

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:90%
we want to oppress.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:10%
And unfortunately, when it
comes to the divine feminine

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:10%
and women's power, women's
wisdom, the wounded masculine,

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.020 align:middle line:10%
the shadow masculine, not the
divine and healthy masculine,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:10%
but the ones who rule
the world, in order

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:10%
for them to be in power,
it's come at the cost

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:10%
of exploiting others.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:10%
And the feminine power
was perceived as a threat

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:10%
to the rise of patriarchy and
the rule and control of men.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So for many reasons,
different values

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
came through to shun and
oppress and diminish and condemn

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:90%
feminine power.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:10%
So, for example, when
property is handed down

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:10%
from the male line, it was
important to preserve a woman's

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:10%
sexuality and virginity
so that it goes

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:10%
through the actual male heirs.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So it comes down to
money, wealth, property,

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining
this that ended up

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
being connected to
women's reproduction,

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:84%
our sexuality now becoming
under the control of the church,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of religions, of male
authorities that we're still

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:90%
struggling with in today's age.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So for women, it's
a wake-up call.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:84%
It means that we really,
once we wake up to our power,

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
it's going to wake us
up to examine our life

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and where we have given our
power away, where we're not

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:84%
being true to ourselves, where
we are compromising and settling

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:90%
and sacrificing.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it can be a little
scary to come back and say,

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I am a powerful being, and I
reclaim my full feminine power,

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm ready to
be all of who I am.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot of--
as women, we've inherited

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of fear and shame
of wanting too much,

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
of being too much, of having
a voice, of having it all.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I say now, in my world,
when women work with me,

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:84%
we get be and have it
all from our feminine.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's my passion to
bring back the goddess.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
We all have the goddess
within us, and it's time.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
She is ready to be awakened
in our world and in us

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
individually so
that we can bring

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
the healing and the balance
that's needed in a collective

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and then, especially for
us as women, to really rise

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
into our power and
the full spectrum

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:90%
of our divine feminine gifts.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And the divine
feminine, actually,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:84%
finding her power
benefits everybody.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no threat.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:84%
There's only more
growth, more evolution,

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:90%
and more good for everyone.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hopeful
that, as we release

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.520 align:middle line:84%
our fear of feminine power
and begin to embrace it,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
create so much balance

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and that we're birthing
collectively a new paradigm.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:90%
