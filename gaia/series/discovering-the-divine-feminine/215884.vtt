00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EILEEN DAY MCKUSICK :
Relationships can be such

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.480 align:middle line:84%
an incredible crucible
for finding the balance

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
of the divine masculine
and divine feminine,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:90%
both within and without.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I know that for many, many years
my relationship with myself

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:90%
wasn't whole.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Part of the whole reason why
I went into the healing arts

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
in the first place
was to put together

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
the shattered sense of self that
I emerged from childhood with,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and really put all those
pieces back together.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Healing is wholeing,
it's a process

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:84%
of rebuilding yourself
back into one being and not

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:90%
a million little pieces.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, as my own
relationship with myself

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
improved, as I came into more
and more integrity within myself

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and more balance within myself,
that showed up in my marriage.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And my husband, fortunately,
was on the same path.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that I've been
married for 27 years,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and my husband has
gotten much, much better

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
at seeing me, hearing
what I'm saying.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've gotten much better
at communicating in such a way

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:90%
that I can be heard.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's taken us a
long time to get there.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I would say that we had
a sandpaper relationship

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
for a long time,
and there was a lot

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
of rubbing off the rough edges
on each other to get to a place

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
where we became much better
versions of ourselves.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But you have to know
that the person has it

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
in them, has that
potential in them,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
willing to do that work.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of men aren't willing
to, quote, "do the work"

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
because it involves feeling
emotions that they're afraid

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
of and don't know
what to do with.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:10%
And so they get kind
of trapped in that.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you can really
understand what's going on

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and that a lot of
what men struggle with

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:90%
isn't just their own trauma.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:84%
We're downstream of many
generations of trauma.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Lots of war and difficulty
and addiction and poverty.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of lies and
misinformation in our culture.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And men are struggling not
just with their own stuff,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:84%
but everything they've
inherited that's come

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
downstream that the men before
them weren't able to deal with.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.248 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely am observing
more and more men getting

00:02:56.248 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:84%
in touch with these
things that we've

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
been talking about while not
losing their masculinity.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that the
failure of men to be good men

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of the problem
from their mothers, I do.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Like, if men don't know
how to treat women,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and men don't know how
to be there for women,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:90%
then their mother failed.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's really important
that women raise good men.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they need a
strong father figure,

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:90%
but they also need a woman who--

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
a mother, who teaches
them how to treat a woman.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And that comes a lot
from her own self-respect

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and her own boundaries and
how she treats herself.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, it all
comes back to our relationship

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:90%
with our self.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I will say that when
my husband and I got together

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.215 align:middle line:84%
and he was 21 and I was
28, he was not a good man.

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] He had a lot of
cultural and ancestral miasms

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:90%
and bad behaviors.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And I also wasn't
fully in integrity.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But what I see in men
today is that there

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
are so many tools and
resources and men's group

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and an awakening awareness
in men about the inner work

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:90%
that they need to do.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I see more and more men
being willing to do that.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:84%
And if they can
find a good woman

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and do it together, if a woman
can find a good man who's

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
willing to go through
the discomfort

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
of true emotional
healing, you can come out

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the other side in a really
great place together.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, we hit a place,
maybe about 20 years in,

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
where I could finally feel like
I loved him like I loved God,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and that he loved me
like he loved God.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And that when we were
together that there--

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
like the peace of God
abided in both of us.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:90%
And that took really--

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
a lot of work to get there,
both personally and together.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
We really helped to work out the
things within each other that

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
were not God, that were not
in integrity, that were not

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
in truth, that were not
expressing their highest

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And we held each other
to that standard.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And to finally get to a place
where you can love your beloved,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
where you can spoon
them in bed at night

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and feel as if
you're holding God

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and have that kind of
contentment, right?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Then that's a really
externalized, living example

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
of the balanced
masculine and feminine.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:90%
He's very, very male.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm with him, I
get to be very, very female.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But I was also raised as
a self-sufficient female.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the times when I'm
by myself or traveling,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
my own inner masculine
takes care of me.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think that
for women and men alike,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
it's useful to be able to
be extremely yin, extremely

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
soft, extremely concave
when you need to be,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and then extremely
pointed and extremely yang

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and extremely
fiery when you need

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:84%
to be, and to be able
to really flow back

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:90%
and forth between these two.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I hang around with a
lot of people who are

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:90%
speakers and things like that.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And the ones-- the guys
that can, in one breath,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
be really vulnerable
and maybe even

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
be on the edge of tears, and
then, in the next breath,

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.600 align:middle line:84%
be confident, clear,
empowered, all the things

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that you want in a man, and
that ability to just slide

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:90%
back and forth between the two.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where
health really comes from.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
is that flexibility and that
ability to rise to the occasion.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the feminine or the
masculine that needs to show up,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
or maybe the perfect
balance of both.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:10%
I think a lot of
dysfunctional sexuality, well,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:10%
it comes from a number
of different things.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
One is the impossible
standard of female beauty

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
that is held up to
us in our culture.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
That makes women feel
less than if they

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
don't have a six-pack, or
all the things that go along

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:84%
with being beautiful
and fit and sexy.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of women have shame
just around their own bodies.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you have shame
about your body or shame

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
about your belly, you have
shame about your breasts,

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to enjoy the
ecstatic potential of sexuality.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:90%
It becomes an inhibitor.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you are
ashamed of yourself,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
or you're guilty about
yourself and you're inhibited,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily
step into your power

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
around claiming your own
fulfillment of desire.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And if women aren't comfortably
embodied and happy to take up

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
space and advocate
for their own needs,

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
they often end up
getting the short end

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:84%
of the stick in sexual
relations and don't necessarily

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
have the opportunity
to explore all

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
of the amazing
orgasmic potential that

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
exists in an exquisite
divine feminine body,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity
to have sex become

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.030 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual,
electric, empowering,

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and enlivening experience.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.900 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's a lot of ways that
culture has taken women's power

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:10%
away, quite frankly.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think a big part
of self-reclamation

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:90%
involves embodiment.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:10%
But unfortunately, in the
world of spirituality,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:10%
there is a lot of dismissal or
eschewing of the physical body,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:10%
a focus on upper chakras or
ascending or going to 5D instead

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:10%
of descending into the body
and the rapture that can occur

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:10%
within your own fully
embodied biofield.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of feelings that
our bodies can generate,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to wait
for Christ to come back

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:90%
to have the rapture.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
That state is available
in our embodied experience

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:90%
of being human.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And another way that I've come
to see the feminine showing up

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
in this work is that I
would say that because we

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.720 align:middle line:84%
are electrical beings,
we are polarized.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when we go
and we stand barefoot

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
outside in the
grass or the sand,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:84%
we draw up what we call
the negative current

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:90%
from the surface of the Earth.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
The surface of the Earth
is charged negatively,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and that goes up through
the central channel

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of the torus, the electrical
bubble that our system is.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
ascending current,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:90%
which is negative or feminine.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we draw in
positive energy from the sun

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:90%
and from the atmosphere.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So the torus that
is our biofield

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
is a double spiraling
structure that

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:84%
is flowing bidirectionally with
negative current and positive

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:90%
current.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So that Earth energy,
we often think

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
of Mother Earth,
that is something

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that actually people are very
depleted in in our culture.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Rubber-soled shoes
are an insulator

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:84%
that stop us from discharging
positive energy into the ground

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and drawing negative
current up into our bodies.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Things like devices and
machines and fluorescent lights

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and the kinds of machines that
are in indoor environments

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
really increase the amount of
positive charge in our system.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And since that's a
down-going charge,

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:84%
it can make people feel
heavy, tired, drained,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:90%
like they need to recharge.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And so, why do we go to places
like the beach or the forest?

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Because we instinctively
know we need to recharge.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
We need to draw
more negative energy

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:90%
into our electrical system.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
makes us feel better.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And we want to have a
healthy balance of the two

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
with just a little bit
more negative energy

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:90%
than positive energy.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And that creates more of a sense
of an uplift in the system,

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to feeling
that down current.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It makes me think of
the Daoist quote that

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
says, know the masculine,
but keep to the feminine.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
really relevant in the balance

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:84%
of negative and positive
charges in the body.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, we absolutely need
to be anchored and connected

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
human experience.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
When people just
want to be spiritual

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and don't really care
about their bodies,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of missing the
point, because their body is

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:84%
the temple that
the soul dwells in.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And you want that temple to be
clean and beautiful and well

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:84%
appointed so that you can have a
divine experience through being

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:90%
human, that it isn't separate.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
That material-- This is just
as much God as the heavens.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And that we actually can have an
incredibly spiritual experience

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
by descending fully
into the body.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And healing isn't a process
of raising your vibration

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:90%
or going up some kind of scale.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:84%
It's really a process of
expanding in every direction

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:84%
as you release the
patterns of tension that

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:90%
have kept you small.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to unfurl
and unfold, you expand.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is an aspect that
feels like it's going up,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
but there is also an
experience of becoming wider,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.810 align:middle line:84%
gaining more perspective, as
well as becoming more grounded

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and more connected to the
Earth, more feet on the ground,

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and really committing
to being fully here,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.590 align:middle line:84%
not ascending to 5D or
something like that.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we're in that
ascending mindset,

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
we are disconnecting
ourselves from receiving

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that negative charge, that
earthy grounding that we

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.685 align:middle line:84%
get from being fully human
and fully present here.

00:13:49.685 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
When we start thinking
about the law of attraction,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
for example, a lot of people
will think about things.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But when you're only
thinking about something

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and not feeling it,
you're only working off

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
half of the coin, right,
one side of the coin,

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
the electric side,
the thought side.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
It's really important to
also feel the feelings.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a saying that your
vibe attracts your experience,

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
but I would shift
that up a little bit

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and say your vibe
is your experience.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
However you feel, that's
what you're doing,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:90%
that's what's going on.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And people respond
to how you feel.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.820 align:middle line:84%
If you feel great and happy and
you have a spring in your step

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and a sparkle in your
eye and an easy smile,

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to smile at you.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Life is going to reflect
that back to you.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:90%
So your vibe is your experience.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we want
something, we want

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:84%
to be creative and make
something happen in the world,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
because we can do
that as humans.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
It's really important to
realize that experience

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
isn't necessarily going
to give you that feeling.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
You want to create the
feeling in yourself first,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you will
have that experience.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.050 align:middle line:90%
And we all know how to do that.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:84%
We could ask a room
of five-year-olds

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to go through expressing
different feelings,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and they would do it
beautifully because we all

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:90%
know how to do that.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
feel a particular way

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
as a consequence of some
desire being fulfilled,

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:90%
then just feel that way.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you invoke
the power of your own emotions,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:84%
because we do have
the power to do that,

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
the more we will start to
create a life around us

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:90%
that reflects that.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most powerful
emotions that we can feel

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.278 align:middle line:90%
is gratitude.

00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Actually, quite a
lot of studies have

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
been done in how keeping
a gratitude journal

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
or being more mindful
about expressing gratitude

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day
lifts people's spirits.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So gratitude,
appreciation, and presence,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
knowing the masculine

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
but keeping to the
feminine is that ability

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
to really show up in the
moment and be receptive.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that's a
little harder for men.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason why we
have that term, mansplaining.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Because as men, as yang, as
outward, as giving, as doing.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not always easy to
remember or to set yourself up

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to take some time, to be
receptive, to listen deeply,

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:84%
to really be
present, and to come

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
into more of that state of
being and feeling and being

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with that.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Same with women.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
Just being able to really
come into this moment.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the tendency to be
thinking about the future

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
is something that we've really
all been conditioned to.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.167 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people are always
thinking about to-do lists

00:17:20.167 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and where they have to go
and what they have to do

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.583 align:middle line:90%
and how they need to make money.

00:17:23.583 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very yang.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the ability to sit in
the present moment, to rest in.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Really, not just sit
in the present moment

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:84%
but spread out into
the present moment

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and to just really be
present and be receptive

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and be listening and allow
spaciousness is something

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.060 align:middle line:84%
that we can all do that
helps to pull us out

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:84%
of that cultural, chronic,
imbalanced yang state

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:90%
and into a more yin state.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And the collective is a
collection of all of us.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And the more that each of us,
whether we're men or women,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:84%
take time to settle into the
moment, to be with our feelings,

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to express tender
love, gratitude,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
appreciation for the people
in our lives, the more

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:84%
that we are collectively
balancing us as a human family.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of it is that it
doesn't involve doing anything.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just an ability
to be and to be

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
more soft and more present.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And that goes a long
way with the people

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
that you encounter when
you're really there

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:90%
and you really care.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, when we're
in a state of health

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and we have a balance of
negative current and positive

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
current, when we can be
regulated and coherent,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
when we don't have a backlog
of emotions, when our ability

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:84%
to receive is turned on when our
ability to just sit and be fully

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%
present in this moment is turned
on when our mental body is

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
balanced, when our
thoughts are orderly

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and healthy and creative
and constructive,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
that's when we experience
the balance of the masculine

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and the feminine within us.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We become coherent,
and health happens

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:90%
when we're in a coherent state.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And those coherent emotions are
love, gratitude, appreciation,

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:90%
and compassion.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
all about being

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:84%
in the right relationship with
yourself at the end of the day.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Are you compassionate, patient,
loving, and kind with yourself?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are, then
you will be that way

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:90%
with other people as well.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the best way
that we can show up and help

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
to balance all of this imbalance
that we see in the world

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.650 align:middle line:84%
around us is starting
with ourselves.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
I think we live in a
world that hides the light

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:90%
and hides the truth.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And that it's almost
a game of how can I

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.300 align:middle line:84%
find the light and the truth
within myself, within others,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:90%
within the world around me.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Our body's electrical
system, our biofield,

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:90%
is your inner light.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's also your soul.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Your soul is biological.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is no separation
of science and spirituality.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And on a certain level,
our soul is perfect.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It's designed for
absolute harmony.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And what we really have
that we struggle with is

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:84%
noise in the signal, most
of which isn't our fault.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But the more that
we bring ourselves

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
into electric and energetic
order, the more brightly

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:90%
we shine.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And we really are the
light of the world.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
We are the light that we
seek, that the light we seek

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.390 align:middle line:90%
is within.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
some nebulous thing.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:90%
It's powering your heart.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:90%
It's powering your brain.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And the magnetic aspect of it
is driving the waves of emotion

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:90%
and feeling through your body.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:11.000 align:middle line:84%
When life plucks your
strings, it's how you respond.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And the more that your
inner instrument is in tune,

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
the more beautifully
you will respond

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:90%
when life plucks your string.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important that we
tend to our own soul and spirit

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:90%
and feed it.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best
ways to do that

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
is to allow all the
waves that are seeking

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to move through it to move
through so that we stay

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
present and current
and not stuck

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
in constriction and
restriction and suppression,

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.340 align:middle line:84%
but really allow the
light in us to shine.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:90%
