00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Eileen McKusick,
and I'm a sound therapist.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm the founder of the sound
therapy method Biofield Tuning.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered that
we are essentially

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:84%
self-tuning instruments that
can be brought back into tune,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and that we're actually
designed for harmony.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we do in Biofield Tuning
is we bounce sound off the body

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:90%
and listen to the ping back.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
sonar or echolocation.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Biofield Tuning uses tuning
forks on and around the body,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
working with the body's
electrical system.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the body is in
motion, and everything in motion

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:90%
makes waves.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:90%
And waves propagate.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And the tuning forks
give us an opportunity

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:84%
to actually hear and
sense the waves that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:90%
are coming off of the body.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
We find areas in the signal
that are dissonant, that have

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:90%
distortion or static in them.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we stay there, and we
reflect that back to the body.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And just like when we
see ourselves in a mirror

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and our hair is a mess, and
we have a seed in our teeth,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
we use that reflection to bring
ourselves back into order.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:10%
The body does the same
thing when it hears

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:10%
dissonance in its own signal.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's a system that,
much like music therapy,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
works with the principles of
resonance and entrainment.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, if someone is
down and tired and unhappy,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
playing them upbeat
music right away

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to necessarily
shift their state.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So a music therapist will
choose a selection that matches,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
that resonates with the
person where they are at,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and then will entrain
them by slowly changing

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:84%
the tempo and the
rhythm of the music

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
into a more upbeat or
enlivened experience.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
The tuning forks
do the same thing.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
They will initially resonate
with an area of our body's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
electrical signal
that is in distortion

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to find
where these areas are

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:90%
very specifically.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, through
its steady rhythm,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
it will entrain the body into
a more coherent expression.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I initially began with
this work working directly

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:90%
over the body.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And one day, in
2006, I discovered

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that there was stuff going
on in the atmosphere fear

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:90%
around the body.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I started to explore there
and discover that our body has

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:90%
a magnetic field.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We learned in
school that anything

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that has electric current
running through it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:90%
has a magnetic field around it.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Human bodies are
really no different.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
We all recognize that
electricity beats our heart,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
keeps our brain waves
moving, aids in our blood

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
flow and our digestion.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're basically running
on electric current.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And that what we call the
Biofield or the body's aura

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
or energy field is
a magnetic field.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And so through bouncing sound
off the body and the atmosphere

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
around it, I discovered
that our magnetic field

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
has a very specific
anatomy and physiology.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I really came to see
the body's electrical system

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:84%
or the Biofield as
what we would call

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:84%
our mind, our conscious mind
where our thoughts happen,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
our subconscious mind where
our memories are stored.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would even
maybe go so far as

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
to say that our electrical body
is our light body and our soul,

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
because when we are
alive, our light is on.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And when we die,
our light goes out.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And the magnetic
field is holding

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
all of the emotions,
all of the memories

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever experienced.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And I've mapped this field.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:10%
I've created what I call the
Biofield Anatomy Map that

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:10%
shows that every time you
have a particular feeling,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:10%
it evokes a particular
tone in your system

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:10%
and then gets stored in a
particular area in your field.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And this came from many years
of working with many clients.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:10%
I've worked with
thousands of clients,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:10%
and I started to notice
that everyone who came in

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:10%
to see me who had left
shoulder pain, for example,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:10%
was carrying accumulated
sadness or grief

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:10%
that they hadn't
been expressing.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And I started to realize
that every time we

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:10%
have a sad feeling
or a sad memory,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:10%
that it gets stored in
the magnetic field off

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:10%
of our left shoulder, and
realize that the whole body has

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:10%
what I call these mind
frames or file drawers,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:10%
where the electrical impulse
of a particular emotion gets

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:10%
stored, and then can also
affect the physiology if that

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.143 align:middle line:10%
is out of balance in our minds
and our emotional bodies.

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
The feminine energy, as it
gets represented in the body,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
shows up in a few
different ways.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
The electric current in the body
and brain waves and thoughts

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:84%
are more electrical,
whereas our emotions

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:90%
are more wavy and magnetic.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I find as a scientist
and a consciousness researcher

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
is that people are very
interested in the electricity

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in the brain when it
comes to consciousness,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
but not very interested
in the magnetic field.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, you can't
really separate the two.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has electric
current running through it

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:84%
has a magnetic field around
it, and there are really

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:90%
two sides of the same coin.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like this disinterest
in the magnetic field,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
especially by more
left-brain scientists,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
is exemplary of the dismissal
of the feminine in our culture,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
very left-brained,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:84%
yang-oriented doers and
givers and thinkers, and less

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
inclined to feel safe
or comfortable being

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.663 align:middle line:90%
receptive or feeling.

[SOFT MUSIC]

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And in our culture,
most of us were

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:84%
raised by parents who gave us
an abstinence-only approach

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to emotions, that we were
basically told to not feel.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Girls aren't
supposed to get angry

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:90%
or say that you hate anything.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Boys aren't supposed to cry.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And because we're not
shown healthy ways

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to manage emotion,
most of the time

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
we develop a habit of
suppressing our emotions.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And there is no end of available
diversions in our culture

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:84%
to help us to
suppress our feelings.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Again, having worked with so
many people, what I've really

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
found is that most pain
that people are experiencing

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of emotion
that they're not

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:90%
letting themselves feel.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Most issues with mental
health, OCD, perseveration,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
intrusive thoughts,
this is a consequence

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
of trying to think our
emotions instead of feel them

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.090 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
allowed to feel them.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're certainly not
allowed to express them.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when emotional energy
is blocked or stunted,

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
it gets shunted into
the mental body,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:84%
causing the mental body
to overwork, to overspin,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and to do things like
require addictions

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
or develop strange behaviors
as a consequence of trying

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.717 align:middle line:84%
to manage what
feels unmanageable.

00:08:21.717 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:90%
[CALM MUSIC]

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:84%
But I really think that we don't
have a crisis in mental health

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
so much as we have a
crisis in emotional health

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and an inability to find
safe ways and safe places

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to let out the sounds
that are trapped in us,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:84%
the cries that we didn't
let ourselves express,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
the tears, the anger, or
whatever kinds of feelings

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:84%
have been generated in the body
because an emotion is a wave.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:90%
It gets generated.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:90%
It rises up.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It crests into some
kind of expression,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:90%
and then it falls away.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But if an emotion
starts to rise up,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and we push it back down

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:84%
with food or drugs or
overwork or Netflix bingeing,

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that wave of life force
energy gets frozen.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:90%
It gets stuck in your body.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we
suppress our own life force,

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:84%
the more our vital
energy gets tied up

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
in the emotional waves
that are stuck within us,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
we become less and less
available to ourselves

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and other people and more
and more tense and resistant.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I've observed

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
is that most disorders
that people suffer from

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:90%
are tension-based.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much anything
that you can think of,

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:84%
there are some kind of pattern
of tension going on there that's

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
stopping the body from
taking care of itself

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:90%
and keeping itself in order.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And holding back emotions
actually takes a lot of energy.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So people wonder
why they're tired,

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:84%
why they have this
disorder or that disorder.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, they've
been holding them back

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:90%
because they've been trained to.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
As a consequence, they're not
available to their own selves

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think men have
been really programmed

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle line:90%
to shut down their emotions.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Women have been granted a little
more freedom to be emotional.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
As a woman, especially
a menstrual woman,

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
it can be pretty hard to
rein in your emotions.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I do think that
women are granted a bit more

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
leeway or expectation
of emotionality.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But many men will just
immediately shut down

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:90%
their own emotional experience.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And then this becomes--

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
well, it turns into
things like back pain.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely a big
place where it can go.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But it also turns into a
dynamic between men and women

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
where, when a woman
starts being emotional,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
then a man's reflexive response
is to either shut her down,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
like he shuts down his own
emotions, or to try to fix.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But what a woman
really needs when

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
she's having an
emotional experience

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:84%
is not to be shut down,
not to be invalidated,

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and not to be fixed,
but rather for a man

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to just be the banks
of the river for her

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
while she goes through that
emotional, wavy experience.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And she'll come
out the other side.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:90%
She'll solve the problem.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:90%
She'll sort it out.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
But if you try to shut her
down, or you try to fix her,

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
you're just going to make
the problem go on and on.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's really
important that men maybe

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.880 align:middle line:10%
use that as a mirror for their
own emotional experience,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:10%
that they become the banks
of the river for themselves

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:10%
and allow whatever emotion
is arising to flow through.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Because emotions are waves.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:90%
They're not infinite.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
They don't go on
forever and ever.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:84%
They have a duration,
a periodicity

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.370 align:middle line:90%
that comes to an end.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you can find a way
to just allow that wave

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:84%
to move through without
trying to stop it or fix it,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:84%
then you just feel
better on the other side.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's important
is that emotions are messengers.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
They're part of a
system in our body

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and our mind to keep us safe
and healthy and responsive

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:90%
to our environment.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
We're designed to move away from
pain, to move towards pleasure,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and our emotional feeling
sense guides us into health.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So the more that we
shut down our connection

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to these emotional
messages and movements,

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.315 align:middle line:84%
the more that our health
suffers because of it.

00:12:56.315 --> 00:12:59.614 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:12:59.614 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I think one of
the biggest things

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that women struggle with
is being unseen, unheard.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the wounded
feminine shows up

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
in people as a kind of shame,
constriction, a contraction,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.780 align:middle line:84%
a diminishment of
self, a sense of,

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't even
be taking up space.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm not heard.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a real pulling inward,
a real constriction.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Think about a flower that
doesn't bloom or open.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But the healthy feminine is
receptive, is inviting, is soft,

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
is kind, is
comforting, is loving,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
all of those things in
a healthy expression,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and comfortable taking up space,
and comfortable being heard,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
willing to reside in that soft
splendor of femininity, which

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.440 align:middle line:84%
is something that I
think a lot of women

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:84%
are not able to
do in our culture.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the masculine comes out
as maybe too hot or too sharp,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
cruel, merciless, angry, unkind,
unempathetic, uncompassionate.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a pointedness,
a hardness, a hotness

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:90%
to the imbalanced masculine.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the balanced
masculine is

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
more protective and
supportive, like

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I said earlier, the
banks of the river.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine
gets to be the river,

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and the masculine gets to
be the banks of the river.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:90%
And you need both.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we all have
the expression,

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I think, in different
ways, in different amounts

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
of the unhealthy yang that
gets too hot, too pointed,

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:90%
unhealthy feminine.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a approach to life that
I call stuff and blow, which

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
is overindulging the
feminine imbalance of not

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
expressing, holding back,
holding in, denying,

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:20.080 align:middle line:84%
accommodating, biting the
tongue, not letting it out,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
until they can't
stuff it anymore.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:90%
And then it comes out as a blow.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
It comes out very yang, very
masculine, very hot, very--

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] so that's an example
of the imbalanced feminine

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and the imbalance
masculine working together.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I stuffed and stuffed and went
in and in until I couldn't, and

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:90%
then I exploded out.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And both of them
are dysfunctional.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:84%
You're never going to get
anywhere with that kind.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, when you come
from a balanced place,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:90%
you can be authentic.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:90%
You can be honest.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But you can be yin and
gentle at the same time.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Being authentic
doesn't necessarily

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
mean being offensive,
that it's possible to find

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.340 align:middle line:90%
that beautiful balance of both.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about masculine
energy and feminine energy,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
you can really compare that
to negative electricity

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:90%
or positive electricity.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:90%
We all have both in us.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:84%
We are all both
feminine and masculine.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And even the right and
left sides of our bodies

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:84%
express masculine
versus feminine traits.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, I've
observed the right side

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of the body has emotions
that are more hot,

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
that are more fiery,
that are more outgoing,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
tendencies that are more
external or future-oriented.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the left side of
the body is more feminine.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:90%
It's more yin.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It's more inward.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:90%
It's more watery.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:84%
It tends to hold emotions that
are more wet or internalized,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and maybe more dealing with
the past instead of the future.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
same from women to men.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And most people in
our culture have

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:84%
most of their electric current,
their vital energy running

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:84%
more through the right
side of their body

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
than the left side
of their body.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:84%
I say that, as a culture,
we're sort of pitched yang.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I was first
exploring the Biofield,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I was really surprised to
discover that in everybody I

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
worked on men and women
alike, that everyone

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
had this wheel of
energy running about

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:84%
18 inches off their
right hip, and that there

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
was an astonishingly large
amount of the body's electricity

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:84%
was in this very
imbalanced place.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that it was this
energy of chronic overdoing

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and overthinking, the
carrot and the stick,

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
the "gotta pay my bills," and
"gotta run my to-do list,"

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and "gotta do this,
and gotta do that."

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It makes me think about how,
when my kids were little,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
my son said to me, why do I
have to leave to go to school,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and you guys have to
leave to go to work.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we all just stay
home and be together at home?

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why we don't
all stay together at home

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is because we're running
our energy 18 inches off

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:84%
of our right hip in a constant
treadmill of doing and thinking.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is very much
the Western world.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:10%
It's a very masculine
world that we live in,

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:10%
and the tendency to work all
the time and not take naps

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:10%
and not rest is the
mentality of a slave.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
In our culture, the 70 or 80
or 90-hour workweek is praised.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We are rewarded and trained
from a very early age.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And if kids go to school for
seven or eight hours a day,

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and then they go home.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And they do two or three
hours of homework every night.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to
realize that we've

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:84%
been groomed to be workers,
and that we've also

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
been inserted with programs that
make us feel guilty when we're

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
not being productive, and
that these are programs,

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and that if you come
up against this feeling

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
that you feel guilty that
you're not being productive,

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that's a file that was inserted
into you to keep you being

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
a busy worker bee, that
everyone who has been

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:84%
a habitual overthinker,
overdoer, overworker,

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:90%
it's the hardest habit to break.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been addicted
to a lot of things,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and the hardest thing
for me to give up

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
was the tendency to
overwork and overdo.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:84%
It's an easy addiction
to have in our culture.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:84%
As long as I stay busy, and
my mental body stays busy,

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and my physical body stays busy,
as long as I'm in my masculine,

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to tune
into and feel and deal

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:90%
with my wounded feminine.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I can stay out in front
of those feelings.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:84%
As long as I'm in motion, then
I don't have to deal with that.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
When I stop, then
that discomfort

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.345 align:middle line:90%
starts to settle over me.

00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to deal
with that, because I don't

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.033 align:middle line:90%
know how to deal with that.

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The only way that I know
how to deal with that

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:90%
is to get back in motion.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think the first thing to
realize is that feel the guilt,

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.415 align:middle line:90%
but rest anyway.

00:20:21.415 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And so in order for us
to collectively heal

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
the divine feminine and
have a healthier culture

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and human family as a whole,
we have to know how to stop

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and how to be with these
parts of ourselves,

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't,
you're going to encounter

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
an accident or an injury
or an illness that's

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
going to force you to stop and
to deal with all those emotions

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't
been dealing with.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason why
it's hard to deal with them

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.470 align:middle line:84%
is because we were told
they were forbidden.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Many men can point
to the time where

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
their father made it
very clear to them

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that they were not
allowed to cry.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be punished
if I express that emotion.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be unworthy.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And why so many women
struggle with boundaries

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
is because anger is a natural
response to a boundary trespass.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But when we were young,
we were told that it

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:90%
was unladylike to get angry.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we end up
having our boundaries

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
trespassed all the
time while we're

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.286 align:middle line:84%
hitting the brownies or the
wine and feeling like a victim.

00:21:37.286 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So part of it is
the verboten-ness,

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
the forbidden quality
of the emotions

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and the fear of punishment
around experiencing them.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
that a lot of emotions

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:84%
are just very
uncomfortable to feel.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, shame is an
incredibly uncomfortable emotion

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
uncomfortable to feel.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Biofield Anatomy,
shame sits off the right hip.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:10%
But just above it, in
the solar plexus area

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:10%
is where, when we're
feeling self-righteous,

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:10%
or we're blaming, that's
where that energy manifests

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:10%
in the magnetic field.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot easier to
blame and shame others

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
self-righteously than it
is to feel your own shame.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
It's very true that when you're
pointing a finger at someone,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:84%
three fingers are
pointing back at you.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
This is where
narcissism comes from

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and the tendency to deflect
and to defend and to not

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
hear and listen and let
things land because there's

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
such a strong defense
system against feeling

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:90%
the discomfort of shame.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about emotions
is that they all pass.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
No matter how uncomfortable
an emotion is, it passes.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as an infinite emotion.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:90%
I've never found one.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we go around
into our memory banks,

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and I am moving my fork
through your field,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and I hit in a tender
spot, that is that memory

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
because our memories
are in our field.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And I uncover this feeling
like you were never

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.810 align:middle line:84%
welcome in your
own home as a kid.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:84%
That's a deep wound with
a lot of hurt around it.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But feelings buried
alive never die.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:90%
They just don't.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that we can
manage to heal those feelings

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
is you do have to
feel it to heal it.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
You do have to be willing
to allow that wave

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.080 align:middle line:84%
to come up all
the way and suffer

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
the discomfort of that
unpleasant emotion

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:90%
in order to really heal.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And everything in our body has
gone into resistance around it,

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:84%
many patterns of
resistance around feeling.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever go to a playground
that you went to as a kid,

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.752 align:middle line:84%
and the slide seemed so much
bigger when you were little?

00:24:04.752 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're an adult,
you're looking at this slide.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, that's
not really so big.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.323 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way it
is with these emotions.

00:24:11.323 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
They are generated
when you were little,

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and they seemed big and scary.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But when you go back, and
you go into them, if you're

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.022 align:middle line:84%
receiving a Biofield Tuning
session, for example,

00:24:20.022 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and you feel them, yeah,
they're uncomfortable.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:84%
You get through
them pretty quickly,

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's not as scary
or as bad or as horrible

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
as you're afraid
it's going to be.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And the spaciousness,
the clarity, the room,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
the aliveness that you
have when you've actually

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.680 align:middle line:84%
allowed some of these buried
emotions to surface and to move

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
through, is completely
worth the discomfort

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.755 align:middle line:90%
of letting yourself feel them.

00:24:46.755 --> 00:24:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
We can learn to become
more receptive simply

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:84%
by realizing, remembering that
humans are really pack animals

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and that we really
need each other.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
What I find in so many people
is a happiness, a willingness

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:84%
to give and to do and
to give and to do,

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:84%
but a real difficulty in
asking for and receiving

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:90%
help from others.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:84%
We've been programmed to
be the self-sufficient

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:90%
individual in our own silos.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
That is a very masculine
trait because the feminine

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
is much more receiving, and
gracious receiving gives dignity

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:90%
to the act of giving.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet, many people don't
feel worthy of receiving.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
mind virus that

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.110 align:middle line:84%
gets in the way of being
a good team player who

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
can give and receive and
throw the ball around really

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:90%
well with others.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what has divided
us within and without,

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
is a strange feeling, like we're
somehow not worthy of receiving.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would
say that is really

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
the kernel of every
dysfunction that I've ever

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:90%
worked with everyone.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
When I get down right
into the heart of it,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
there's some kind of belief
or story that, in some way,

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:84%
you are not worthy of
a good relationship

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.100 align:middle line:84%
with yourself or a partner,
or having plenty of money,

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
or having your body be
strong and fully healthy,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that we're all infected with
this mind virus of guilt

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and shame and the belief that
we're somehow not good enough.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
especially true with women.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I know that's a generalization,
but it's just something

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:90%
that I've observed.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And the main problems that I see
in my practice, a lot of them

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:84%
are related to baby boomers,
because when I was very busy

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:90%
in my practice, which--

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't do that
so much anymore--

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:84%
the vast majority of my clients
were women over 55, over 60.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And they all had
the same pattern.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They didn't feel like what
they had to say mattered.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Many of them were bottle
fed on a schedule.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, that practice
created beliefs in people,

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that I can ask for what I want,
but I'm not heard or understood

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.500 align:middle line:90%
or responded to.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I must not be good
enough to be responded to.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So they had very often gone
through their life feeling

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
unheard and unworthy.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And so as a consequence,
they dedicated their lives

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:84%
towards taking care
of everyone else

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and lost themselves
in the process

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and then would develop a
tendency of consoling themselves

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:90%
with wine or sugar.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And many of them had gotten
to a point where they realized

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.520 align:middle line:84%
that they were now free
to switch up their life,

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:84%
but they were so trapped in
their own patterns of a lifetime

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that it was very difficult
for them to start

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:90%
to have a different experience.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what my work
does is it comes in--

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:90%
I call myself a bioelectrician.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And we go in, and we find where
all that wiring has been laid

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
down, all those
patterns, and actually

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
help the body to digest
those experiences

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and rewire you back into a
more central, neutral place

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:84%
so that you can move
forward more freely.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you've spent a lifetime
being bound by situations

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.880 align:middle line:84%
that don't work for you, it's
not so easy to get out of them.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:90%
But it definitely is possible.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:90%
