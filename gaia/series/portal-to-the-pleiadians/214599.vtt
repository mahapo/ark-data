self-discovery, of healing,

chose to be of service.

clear their emotional traumas,
their self-limiting beliefs.

to the shift in
consciousness on this planet

A lightworker is someone that
feels like they've always

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
been the black
sheep of the family,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:84%

they're adopted

to all of this information
and energy of the universe,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:10%
realizing that we're a soul
having a human experience.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we identify
ourselves as a lightworker

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:90%
or a starseed or a wayshower.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%

that's been traveling

all around the universe

the extraterrestrial
beings from the Pleiades.

And they're helping
us heal our clients.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So we connect in with
the client's heart

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and take their light
body to the starship.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can see into
their energetic field

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:84%
on the multi-dimensional
level where

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.370 align:middle line:84%
we can see where they have
blocks or emotional trauma

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:90%
from their lifetime.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, their
soul sometimes has a split.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And this happens after
a significant event

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:84%
that happens in their life,
a trauma that might happen,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
an impression from
their family members,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:90%
or their mom or their dad.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:10%
This negative energy within
their body and their being

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:10%
can go on to have an
effect of a negative nature

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.005 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of their life.

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:90%

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, good.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
She's-- her name was
Julie from California.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
She's definitely a lightworker,
but she's stuck in her head.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
She's in the left,
logical side of the brain.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:90%
And the poor thing.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
She's, like, trying to control
everything in her life.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So I took her up to the ship,
and the Pleiadians were, like,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
pulling out all the subconscious
programming from her childhood.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
At seven, she remembered
being a little girl

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and feeling scared when
her father came home.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And all of that emotion
is suppressed within her,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
so the Pleiadians were
helping her to release that.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:90%
And she met the emotions.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:90%
She had a big cry.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, the whole thing.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
She's grown up trying to please
everyone to try and fit in.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So she's like constantly
overcompensating to fit in,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:90%
to be liked, to feel special.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Classic lightworker.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're tuning into a
client and when you're taking

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness to the
ship, it's along the lines

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:84%
of principles that have
been spoken about for many,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:90%
many years.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing,
telepathy, tuning

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:90%
into a person at a distance.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
with that, though,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
is tapping into
galactic consciousness.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
What we've been shown is that we
can use that interconnectedness

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and connect to higher
vibrational consciousness

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to help people to
emotionally balance.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians and the
guidance of the med beds

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.720 align:middle line:84%
is a vehicle, a
trigger, a method

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:90%
to be able to achieve this.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So they can notice big changes
can happen quickly when they've

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
got that mind and that
connection in the right state.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
What I see through talking to
a lot of people is often they

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
don't even realize that there's
any sort of split there.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
They just know the
feeling, you know?

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They just feel like
they're incomplete

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.440 align:middle line:84%
or they've been
damaged in some way.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Or in my case, some sort
of event has happened.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And after that
event, you just don't

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
think you're ever
going to be the same.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And for myself, when I was
doing the inner healing work

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and when I really sort
of wanted to go in there

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and heal my heart,
merge back with my soul,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I got taken by the Pleiadians to
five, to me curled up on my bed

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:90%
in the fetal position.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was listening
to the sound of my mom

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:84%
in the nearby bathroom
crying on the floor,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
almost, like, making
this horrible yuck,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.642 align:middle line:84%
throwing up-type sound into the
toilet over the grief of what

00:05:31.642 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
had just happened
in the household.

It had been raining
heavily overnight,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and I went-- we lived only
probably a five-minute

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:90%
walk up the road.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And we went down.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Dad had a water pump, and he
used to pump from the creek.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So I just went down to
check the water pump

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:84%
because Dad used to
check the water pump,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
just to see if it
was under water.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But I walked back
up to the road.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.982 align:middle line:84%
And instead of going back
to the house quickly,

00:06:02.982 --> 00:06:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I took off down to
this little bridge

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:90%
to see if this was flooded.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And very much like
this, it wasn't flooded,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
but the water was high on
that high side like that,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and it was raging out of that
bottom pipe like a torrent.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And this was all white
rapids, you know?

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Really strong.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were playing
around very much

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.170 align:middle line:84%
like the boys are now, just on
the top here around the water.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was time to go
because we weren't supposed

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:90%
to go down to the creek.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was up,
halfway up the hill

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
there, calling her to come,
telling her to hurry up.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't coming.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I remember
the last glimpse is

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
when I said to her,
if you don't come now,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go without you.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But I saw her-- like,
she was in a red top,

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
she had a nappy
on-- overbalanced,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:84%
fall in, and then
just disappear.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.558 align:middle line:84%
And then, like,
the panic and the--

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
the brutal truth of
going to that memory

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
was I didn't run home
as fast as I could.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I was guilty, so I
walked home slow.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like--

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I was ashamed of myself, and I
didn't even want to tell mom.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.805 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, I
tell her and she loses it.

00:07:22.805 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
The whole house erupts
into cries and bellows.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was a younger brother
who was in a high chair.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:90%
He was crying.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:84%
She's run off down the
road in her dressing gown,

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:90%
like, screaming.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like the reality of
a soul split is brutal.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Like, what goes on?

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
No wonder people don't
want to go there.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
A memory where there is a lot
of intense emotion around it,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
where someone says, I just
don't want to go there,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to think
about that anymore,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
probably the reason that
is, like I had, is I

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:90%
blocked a lot of it out.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had
memories come back to me

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
as I healed that
I had blocked out,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't even realize it.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole experience
was one that I just

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:90%
did not want to address.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.375 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that comes through--

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:84%
like, there was--
the Law of One was

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:84%
written and the channelings by
Ra, the collective consciousness

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.530 align:middle line:84%
of the planet Venus, which
is helping planet Earth,

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:84%
talks about how for your soul
to ascend, for you to graduate

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.230 align:middle line:84%
through this
lifetime, you've got

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:90%
to know thyself, love thyself.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But then ultimately, you see the
infinite creator in everything.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
process of going--

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
know thyself is
every dark corner.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we know
the light, but it

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
wants you to know your
dark because that's

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:90%
where the lessons are.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:84%
We don't get much spiritual
growth sitting on a sun lounge

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:90%
by the pool, listening to music.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like times when life
is tough, when there is loss

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's powerful
emotion, that's

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:84%
a catalyst for our
soul to grow and for us

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:90%
to evolve and develop.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:84%
The benefit is the
freedom, the release.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like this weight gets
lifted off your shoulders.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like a hole
inside of you gets

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
plugged that can't get plugged
up with drugs or alcohol

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
or money or
overachieving, or whatever

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
it might be that people
use to distract themselves

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
from focusing on
the unhealed parts.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's fifth dimensional
wisdom being applied to 3D life,

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:90%
the 3D realm.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden, you
see it and you go, wow.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
All those people that have hurt
me-- like, the whole bit got

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:90%
showed to me.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked through all that
to realize that it was a lesson

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:84%
to get me to this
point of who I am now

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and where Roxy and I are
on our journey of helping

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
other people with this
sort of experience,

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:84%
helping them on their journey
so that hopefully their soul can

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:84%
ascend so they can move
through those lessons that

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.705 align:middle line:90%
are coming their way in life.

00:10:14.705 --> 00:10:18.484 align:middle line:90%

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We're a four-part being, a
spiritual, mental, emotional,

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
and physical.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at our
four-part being as an airplane,

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:84%
like a jet airplane,
to get off the ground

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:84%
we've got to have those four
engines working and operating

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And those four engines
need to operate in balance

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and in harmony for us
to reach ascension,

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
for us to get off the ground and
to soar into really who we are.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people, half
their engines aren't working,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
so they're walking around
unhealed, unsatisfied,

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:90%
and really low vitality.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, when we're
numb physically and emotionally

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and mentally, that affects
our spiritual connection.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So no wonder a person
can't meditate.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
They can't stop the
constant thinking,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
or they're physically in
pain, or emotionally they're

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:90%
shut down.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So of course, it's difficult to
be still and know that I am god.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to go within and
connect to themselves or perhaps

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
something higher vibrational
outside themselves

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:84%
because those three
engines aren't in balance.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can use different
modalities to raise

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
our vibration and
heal ourselves.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So things like breathwork,
meditation, energy healing,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:90%
an ice bath.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Exercise is another great
one to get the breath moving

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:84%
through the system,
to energize the system

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and activate the
lower energy centers.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> As we went on our journey and
we were being guided by these

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.378 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians in the
sessions to go, you guys,

00:12:00.378 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
you've got to look at
your emotional stuff.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look at
your false beliefs.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
change what you eat.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And we were always eating quite
well, and we were always active,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
but we were guided to
take it up a level.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> When we set an intention when
we're using these modalities,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:90%
we have great elevation.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
We start to heal the lower
three energy centers where

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
the suppressed emotion and
the trauma and locked energy's

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.350 align:middle line:90%
stuck.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The ice bath is an amazing
vehicle to be able to get

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:84%
the internal organs
flushed with blood.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.715 align:middle line:90%
About two degrees.

00:12:34.715 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I hoped it would be a
bit warmer than that.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Very often, a person's
not active enough

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
or we're not activating our
lymphatic system, which is

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:90%
tied right in with the breath.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So by having an ice bath
and going into that state

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
where mentally, you've
got to be at your best,

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and then of course
physically you

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
need to be able to
control the breath.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But the blood rushes
to the internal organs.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it,
energetically you feel sharp.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:90%
You're more alert.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.723 align:middle line:90%
You're more awake.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>> When our mental
aspect is in alignment,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
we can really start to become
present in nature as well,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
going out and
grounding in Pachamama.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:90%
She will hold us and nurture us.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And it elevates our frequency
when we're doing this grounding

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
work, when we're
acknowledging nature,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
when we're taking a swim
in the beautiful ocean

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:90%
or the creeks or the waterways.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
We're embodying this human
experience in a physical aspect.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But the mental
aspect of our mind

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
can bring us into the
present moment, which

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:90%
is bringing us into alignment.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It's raising our vibration.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And we feel really
good when we do this.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a bit like that
saying in our family,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:90%
you never regret a swim.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like sometimes
you can be stressed out

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
or there's something
on your mind,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and if you go for that
swim, I don't know.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
There's something about the
frequency of the planet,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and it just has this ability to
be able to suck the stress out

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:90%
of you, give you a reset.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And you just feel energized
and reset and refreshed.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
feeling you can get

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:90%
by truly tuning into nature.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, some people are
mindlessly in nature.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you're tuning into nature
and you set that intention

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
to really ground, you can get
so much clarity, so much renewal

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:84%
just by getting out
there and really

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.440 align:middle line:84%
tuning into this beautiful
planet that we live in.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
physically we're strong,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:84%
emotionally we're more
open and connected,

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
mentally we are more
aware of our thoughts.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you influence
those three engines,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that spiritual aspect of
your being starts to shine.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like for the first
time in your life,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:84%
you really feel like
you can connect.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you're having
a spiritual experience

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
because the four aspects of
your being, the four jet engines

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:84%
are starting to help
you lift off the ground.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You feel lighter, and
this is ascension.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling lighter.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:84%
You're moving towards
becoming a being of light.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:10%
This is Christ consciousness.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
This is the golden age that
we are being ushered into.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's why the old souls
are on the Earth at this time.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people are walking
around lost, unfulfilled,

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:84%
feeling like they're
stuck in life.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know how that feels
because I felt like that before.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's not until
I did the healing

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
that I realized what
I was in and what

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I could move out of, and
just start to enjoy again.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
When the Pleiadians
started to connect with us,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
they told us about
the med bed healing,

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and that it wasn't an
instant fix modality.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:84%
The med beds were a
vehicle to heal and elevate

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
a person's vibration
in the physical body.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is not about
giving your power away.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
This is all about using our
free will or your free will

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
Pleiadian starship

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and to explore and grow as a
soul in this human experience.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So sometimes people
are looking for a savior.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
something outside themselves

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
to make all their
problems go away.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Some sort of following,
some sort of guru,

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:84%
some sort of
magical thing that's

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:90%
going to make their life better.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But what has been
really shown to

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:84%
us powerfully is that our
greatest gift is our free will.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:84%
This ability for us to be able
to forgive ourselves, relieve

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
ourselves of our traumas, of
our pain, and grow from it

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and evolve as a soul is a
key point for ascension.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when we
have an activation,

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
our soul has this awakening
to this higher consciousness.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:90%
We realize we don't belong here.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:84%
We might have felt
like the black sheep

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:84%
of the family our whole life,
or maybe that we're adopted.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We start to get activated in
the lower three energy centers,

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:90%
and our traumas are released.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:90%
So think about a volcano.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
The volcano doesn't erupt
until something triggers it.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets triggered,
the heat of the bottom layers

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
are going to come up through
the system and start to release.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And we start to
acknowledge and feel

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
our locked emotions that
have been suppressed

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And so as the energy comes
up through the system,

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
comes through the
heart for us to feel,

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:84%
it comes through the throat
chakra for us to talk about,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:84%
our mind to process, and then
finally leaves out the top.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we'll
have some tremors

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that might come after
like the aftershock.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But the heat at the bottom
of the volcano, the bottom

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:84%
of your energy
centers are coming up

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to be released so you can
feel free and heal yourself.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And as we go within
and address these things,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:90%
no one wants to talk about them.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
People often play along
like, everything's OK.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to see here.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.235 align:middle line:84%
But buried in the dungeon
is the disconnected,

00:18:24.235 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:90%
the unloved little boy or girl.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's crying to be
healed, crying to be heard,

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:90%
crying to come out.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And it manifests itself
in our day-to-day life.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, from the
guilt and the shame that I

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:84%
felt through the
death of my sister,

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:84%
it manifested itself
in my behavior.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I was painfully shy at school.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:90%
And it manifested in emotions.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I had massive emotions
of pleasing people.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd run around trying to
make everyone else happy

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
because deep inside myself
I felt the guilt, the shame.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel good enough.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So that emotion was so strong
carrying itself through, even

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:84%
to the point where early
choices I made in my life I knew

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:84%
weren't right for me,
but I was trying to keep

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:90%
the facade of the family.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.635 align:middle line:84%
You're a good boy, the
eldest of the boys.

00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do
the right thing.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, if you make
that choice, what

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.590 align:middle line:90%
will the grandparents think?

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
What will the aunties
or uncles think?

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So instead of doing
what I wanted,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
I would play the facade of
making everyone else happy.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
The parents, the grandparents,
the aunts, the uncles.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And totally disconnected from
myself and who I really was.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I healed, when I really
went through this awakening

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:84%
journey with intention,
I connected back

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:90%
to that lost little boy at five.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the guilt,
the shame, that responsibility

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that I'd carried
through my life,

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.970 align:middle line:84%
manifesting itself in back pain,
in neck pain, manifesting itself

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:84%
in issues with women, that all
came out in my physical body

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
through the broken left
foot, the broken left arm

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
that I've had, problems all the
way up the left side of my body.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Me getting pointed to look at
divine feminine in your life,

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
all linking back
to my relationship

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
with my little sister
and the event that

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:90%
happened in and around that.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, being lost,
I didn't see any of that.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
addressed it, as soon

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
as I went back to that
little five-year-old boy

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and released all of those
underlying root causes,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
everything in my physical
body shifted and changed.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:84%
The mental aspect of my
being shifted completely.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
My relationship
with myself changed.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But my ability to
connect, my ability

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feel peace
within shifted dramatically,

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:84%
all through this
process of healing

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that has been divinely
shown and Roxy and I

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
have been guided through
through the help of this higher

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:90%
vibrational energy.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So with the help of
this galactic guidance,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
we can heal ourselves, use
the power of our free will

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
to release that trapped
energy, to free ourselves

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
of those bonds
that are like holes

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:84%
in the bucket of our happiness,
draining out our life energy.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Once they get addressed
and we plug them up,

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:84%
the person starts
to shine again.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
They have that
enthusiasm, that spark.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
The inner child, that little
boy or girl, starts to come out.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And people see it in the
person's day-to-day life.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:90%
They are happier.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:90%
They are more fulfilled.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
They're nicer to be around
because the person is healed.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.234 align:middle line:90%
[MYSTICAL MUSIC]

00:21:47.234 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:84%
The shift in consciousness
from 3D to 4D to 5D is going

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.880 align:middle line:90%
on on the planet right now.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And each and every one of
us have a role to play.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now on the
planet, we're separate.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And if we all came together
and looked at ourselves

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and helped each
other unite as one,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
there'd be a lot more
peace on the planet.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:10%
We'd be able to consciously
live and bring up our children

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.140 align:middle line:10%
learning these techniques
and this wisdom

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:10%
so they can have
togetherness and love and joy

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:10%
as well as a human collective.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the time of
the Great Awakening.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And what the Great Awakening is
is the shift in consciousness.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:84%
People are starting to wake
up, to become more aware.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for
every single one of us

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we are
here for a purpose.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
We are not just here having
some sort of human experience

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:90%
that means nothing.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:84%
We are contributing
to this shift

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and change in consciousness,
and we are here for the mission.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And it has an
impact on the planet.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Our vibration and how
we treat each other

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.490 align:middle line:90%
is a mirror of Pachamama.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:90%
She feels our fighting.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
She feels our projection,
our judgment, our separation.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So she wants us to be
together, to help each other,

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:90%
to become one.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians are here
to help us and guide us.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
They're here because it has an
energetic pull on their planet

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.817 align:middle line:84%
There's all different
planets in the universe.

00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:23.630 align:middle line:84%
We're still learning and growing
and raising our frequency

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:90%
to explore that wisdom.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But they're here because our
planet has dropped into 3D

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.300 align:middle line:90%
density.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a low frequency.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's having
an energetic pull

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:90%
on the rest of this universe.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when they come here
and they help us and help

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:84%
us drop our density and
raise our vibration as one,

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:90%
it has an impact.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like an ecosystem
in the universe

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:84%
where we can all energetically
spread the energy,

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and we all work as one
in harmony once again.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's pretty unique to go
through a spiritual awakening

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:90%
and still be together.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Very often, when one person
wants to shift and change,

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.580 align:middle line:84%
the other person
thinks, what the heck's

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:90%
going wrong with them?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Or, I've lost them.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Or, oh, no.

What's this going to mean?

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And certainly in
our relationship,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.670 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't always been
rainbows and sunshine.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
We have had some tough times
during this awakening journey.

>> When I had my awakening
and the trigger came to me,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.260 align:middle line:84%
it was actually Pete
that triggered me,

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:90%
and he did nothing wrong.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But I moved out the very
next day, took the kids,

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.165 align:middle line:84%
packed up my bags,
and moved out.

On the plane home,
I was meditating,

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:10%
and the Pleiadians started
communicating with me.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, oh my god.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.600 align:middle line:10%
Are aliens even real?

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.705 align:middle line:10%
And they looked humanoid in my
visions, in my meditation state.

00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:10%
>> And weird things
were happening with

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:10%
their electronics, and things
were shutting off and freezing

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:10%
and malfunctioning.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:10%
And she was starting to notice
almost nightly connections

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:10%
to these beings.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:10%
And she's saying,
I feel like they're

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:10%
wanting to connect with me.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.870 align:middle line:10%
I wonder what this means.
