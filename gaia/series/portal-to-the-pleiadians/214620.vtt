on a day-to-day basis

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:10%
is we've got to
do the inner work.

We've got to go in there
through those soul contracts

that we signed up for
right at the beginning,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:84%

no, what have I got myself

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
into again when
we saw what we had

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%

this life, when you think,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:90%

we may have about ourselves,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:10%

happen all the time,

but they always happen
differently for everyone.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:10%
And my awakening happened
when I got triggered by Pete,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:10%
the masculine, and I moved out.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
One night I was putting
the kids to bed,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and Pete was out with a
friend in the kitchen,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:84%
having a couple of
wines and talking.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Not being that loud, but in my
head, I was getting triggered.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling frustrated
that I could hear them,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't
sleep, and he wasn't

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:90%
helping me put the kids to bed.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
did nothing wrong,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
but I was just
getting so triggered

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:90%
by the masculine energy.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what was going on.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my god,
I'm going to move out,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:90%
and that'll solve it.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to exit,
and that's what I did.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
The very next day, I packed
the bags and I said, it's over.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And I moved out [LAUGHS]
down to a local beach.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And I hired a unit on the beach.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So for seven days I sat on
the beach with the kids,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and I just prayed to god.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I prayed to anything that
would listen and help

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
me understand what the
heck was going on with me.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't actually
religious growing up.

We didn't go to church or pray
over dinner before eating,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But I believe there
was a something that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
created this universe,
that made us all,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that's something
would hear my call for help.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:90%
And that it did.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Not long after, I went back to
the unit, made the kids lunch.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And on Facebook, this girl
was talking about awakening.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And that word just completely
activated me again.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And I rang her and I said,
hey, this is what's going on.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And she explained to me,
you're having an awakening.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
what does that mean?

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, I understood

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
why I was having these
emotional breakdowns, why

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
my anxiety, my stress, my
panic attacks were coming out,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
why I was getting
triggered by Pete,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.970 align:middle line:84%
the masculine, the beautiful
husband that I had.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't him.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
That was just the
surface level triggering

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:84%
deep-rooted emotional trauma
and density from my childhood.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So after that conversation,
I realized, oh, OK.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
break up with Pete.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
It's actually not his fault.
So I moved back into the house.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And Pete and I
had a chat, and we

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:84%
realized that I was
having this awakening.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:10%
And that actually moved him into
having his awakening as well.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:10%
And we realized that
there was a synchronicity,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:10%
that we were having
this awakening together

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:10%
to go through this
journey together and heal

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:10%
in this divine union.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So once we'd started
on this awakening journey,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:84%
we found that we were
led to Costa Rica.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And we were led to doing
ayahuasca and plant medicine

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and seeing how these beautiful
teacher plants, these plant

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
spirits could help us to
connect to ourselves more.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And Pete and I went on a
journey to discover our soul

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and merge back with our
soul, heal our heart,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and realized that we're
here for a big, big mission.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Little did we realize that
ayahuasca's actually spiritually

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like putting
yourself in a slingshot

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and getting slung
into your healing.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Because while things can
sometimes gently unfold,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca is a way of having
a lot unfold quite quickly.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So it was confronting, but we
immediately noticed the results.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It puts your brain into this
beautiful altered state.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And often, people
talk about how when

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:84%
the brain is in this
heightened state of awareness,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:90%
they feel support.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
They feel the guidance
of mother ayahuasca.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But often, other angelic beings
from other realms, light beings

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
or Christ consciousness can come
through and connect to a person,

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:84%
helping the person to
heal, to clear density,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:84%
to become a higher vibrational
expression of themselves

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and offer suggestions
on how they

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
can live their life with
more purpose and fulfillment.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I certainly found
in that experience,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
what I was doing in my life at
that moment wasn't my purpose.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't helping me to really
fulfill my mission as to why

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I was here on the planet.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And as I got guided
more through that higher

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness,
the more I

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
realized that I was going
to be creating shifts

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:84%
in my life because
of that experience.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Mother ayahuasca
is like the teacher,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and she shows you
who you've become.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that was
very confronting.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:84%
She was showing me
and playing back

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
a movie of the person
that I'd become,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
walking around with
stress, anxiety,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
carrying these big piles
of wood on my shoulders

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and carrying all these children
up this massive mountain.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at
it going, oh my god.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm controlling everything.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm a scared little girl
underneath all of that.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But I was in my
masculine energy.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't in my beautiful mother
divine, heart center place.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But certainly showed me who
I'd become through my life.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew on that plane
flight home we didn't want to go

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
back to our normal
3D businesses.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want this
to just be something

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.200 align:middle line:84%
that was a nice experience,
but life goes on like normal.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a bigger soul contract
where we were going to help heal

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:90%
other souls.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
We were going to bridge
the gap between this planet

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and the galactic
and start to elevate

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the planet
for the Great Awakening.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had an amazing
experience in Rythmia

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and on the plant medicine
with the Pleiades.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I used to go out and look at the
stars and feel that connection,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
feel like that was
home, that there

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
was some unexplainable
connection to that star system.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, having
the blue Pleiadian being

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
come through to me in my
journey and the realization

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
of this connection to
an imaginary friend

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I had as a little boy, and
how when I split from my soul

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
at five, that blue
Pleiadian being

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
was comforting me through
that traumatic experience.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So that beautiful bliss
state that I experienced

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
through the connection
of ayahuasca,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I have since found I can
still connect into that

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and still experience those
higher rates of vibration

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
through other modalities,
such as deep meditation,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:90%
such as ice baths.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I love breathwork,
the ability to be

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:84%
able to connect through
yoga or Kriya yoga

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and stimulating the Kundalini.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
ways that people

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
can access even
from their own home

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
this ability to be
able to get to higher

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness through
the raising of the vibration.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And when a person sets that
intention to balance themselves

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.210 align:middle line:84%
as a four-part being and
commits to a spiritual practice

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
with the intention
behind it, we all

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
have this ability to be
able to heal and connect

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.355 align:middle line:90%
to so much more.

00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:53.175 align:middle line:90%
[WIND CHIMES]

00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:56.654 align:middle line:90%
[WIND BLOWING]

00:08:56.654 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> On the plane home
I was meditating,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and the Pleiadians started
communicating with me.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh my god.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Are aliens even real?

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But it was so clear and
precise, these messages.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And they looked humanoid in my
visions, in my meditation state.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And the colors were
like normal people.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And they kept saying, we're
from the Pleiades, remember?

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have the awakening,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and we were going to
connect in with you.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to help guide
you and heal and move you

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
into higher states
of consciousness.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to be
here for the mission, remember?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>> When Roxy started
to come through saying,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I just had this deep meditation.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
There were Pleiadians
coming through.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And initially I
was like, oh, wow.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.730 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
happen again and again.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was starting
to think, what's

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:84%
going on here with these
beings coming through to her?

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:84%
What are people going to
think of us, talking to ETs?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.290 align:middle line:90%
We've just done plant medicine.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking
to ETs, you know?

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And weird things were
happening with our electronics,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and things were shutting off
and freezing and malfunctioning.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And she was starting to notice
almost nightly connections

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:90%
to these beings.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying,
I feel like they're

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:90%
wanting to connect with me.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what this means.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite confronting
because a little bit of this I

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
could kind of
handle, but this was

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
starting to become a part of
our regular conversations.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And for me, quite
confronting as to what

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
this connection with
aliens regularly

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:90%
really was going to mean.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was all really
crazy and really out there,

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:90%
so it was our little secret.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But they just kept
coming through,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:90%
and it was beautiful energy.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were, like,
helping and nice and kind.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling that we
received in our hearts

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
was just this divine
love, like they're

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:84%
a spark of the divine
like us humans.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're here for the
greater good, to help everyone,

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to heal, to return
to connection.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And they just kept
coming to me naturally.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And my free will was
like, OK, what is this?

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted-- and
I set the intention

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:90%
to connect more to them.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do this and
learn more about this.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:84%
They will never come in and
infringe on our free will.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to want to connect to
this frequency, these beings,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:90%
and learn and grow.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
As the Pleiadians
kept coming to me,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to go up to this
starship in 5D consciousness.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a physical starship
where I would remote

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
view my consciousness,
take my light body,

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
my soul up there in
these meditative states.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I got up there, there
was this med bed technology.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
understand why they

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:90%
were showing me all of this.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So every day, I'd go up
there into this frequency,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be shown more and more
about my childhood, my pain,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
my root causes, because
the energy of the med bed

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
would highlight these densities,
these shadows in my lower energy

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:90%
centers, in my heart system.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And flashbacks and
visions would be

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.140 align:middle line:84%
given to me of where I
split from my soul, where

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
all this drama with
my father came,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
with the unhappy girl,
why I was suffering

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:90%
from panic attacks and anxiety.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
It all was these energy flows
back into the childhood.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
start to open your heart

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and feel this pain
and these layers

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
start to become
more evident to you.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And they start stripping off.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And it can be such an emotional
thing going through that journey

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
because you see where
you split from your soul,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and where it happened, and why
we were here in the first place.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
The trigger of Pete
activating my awakening

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
was the trigger of my
father being an alcoholic,

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
abusing my mother,
and me witnessing

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
all of this in my
early childhood years.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> On a day-to-day basis,
guys, it can be a tough road.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And for myself
observing Roxy going

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:84%
through the clearing of her
childhood traumas and her pain,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:90%
it can be very confronting.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>> For me, my story--

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
this all started before I was
even born into this world.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:90%
I was in my mother's stomach.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And one night on Christmas
Eve, my father, the masculine,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
was drunk, drinking, and
got arrested by the police.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was this mad
rage through our house,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:84%
which I was experiencing
inside my mother's womb.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:90%
The police were in the house.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling this anger.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
This environment was
soaking into my soul,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and I soaked it all up
like a sponge, you know?

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:90%
The environment was rocky.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:90%
There was no foundation.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So I was constantly
feeling scared.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:90%
He'd be running around.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
At one time, I remember he broke
all the windows in the house

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and we were locked
in the bedroom.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.778 align:middle line:84%
And then when he went
quiet and went down

00:13:56.778 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
the other end of
the house, my mother

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:90%
quickly ran us out to be free.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And these situations were
happening over and over

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and over, so all of
that conditioning

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:90%
got impressed in my being.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
sensitive, so it really

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
did scar me and my energies
and my emotional body.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Not long after that, my
mother did get us out of there

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:90%
and drove us away.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, we landed
in another negative situation

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:90%
with masculine.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And the stepfather that she
was in a relationship with

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:84%
started to sexually
abuse me and my sisters.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So my father's
drinking increased,

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and he then went and
committed suicide.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't grow up
with a father after that.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What it looks like to see
someone going through this

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.480 align:middle line:84%
healing and clearing
these emotional,

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:84%
these mental blocks and this
density that the person may

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:84%
have, what it looks like is it's
actually really confronting.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And it can bring up things
within yourself as well.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Like, I know that when I used to
hear Roxy crying in the bedroom,

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:84%
going through her
childhood things.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'd walk into
the room and I'd

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
see the mascara smeared
all over the pillow,

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
or I'd peer into the
bathroom and she's

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
slumped on the floor of the
shower, crying her eyes out.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Like, sobbing deeply.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:46.355 align:middle line:84%
And like, the first reaction
is to want to go in there.

00:15:46.355 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
As a male, you want to
make everything better.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:90%
You want to take the pain away.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
It's what we're often
programmed to do.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We get taught to
do that for people,

00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:00.559 align:middle line:84%
not allowing them to
go into their process.

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:03.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:16:03.175 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's
probably why Pete and I

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.600 align:middle line:84%
have been given this
role of all these things

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that have happened to be
that example for others,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:84%

we can talk about it now,

when you're clearing
that density.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was challenging
to navigate it.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, I was navigating
the same things for myself.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And the more I became aware
of this whole process--

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
which is why we're talking
about this, to make you aware--

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
the more I became aware of the
process, the more listening

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
to someone cry, listening
to Roxy truly sob,

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes even I
would hear a scream

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:84%
or she'd wake up in the
night and be all upset,

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:84%
the more I was at
peace with it because I

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:90%
realized she was healing.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:90%
That's what healing looked like.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:90%
That density needs to come out.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It needs to clear because
it's getting released.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it turned
into quite a beautiful thing.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Now we can be very
open with one another

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:84%
about expressing our
emotions or expressing what

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:90%
might be coming up within us.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And the shedding of
tears is no longer

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
something which is
upsetting, so to speak.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's something which
we do not avoid.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:90%
We almost embrace it.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:84%
We almost look now for the
unhealed parts of ourselves

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's trying to show
us last traces of density

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to clear, false beliefs that
we still need to work on,

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
or of course, those things that
you've worked on five times

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:84%
before, and they just
show their head again

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:90%

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So for my four-part
being, my physical body

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:90%
was being affected.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
By the age of 19, I
had ovarian cancer,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:84%
which I had to get
surgically removed.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was in
my sacral chakra,

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:84%
all that suppressed emotion
from my early childhood.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And that energy of that sexual
energy from the stepfather

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
was being produced
in the sacral.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So it manifested on the
physical level inside my body.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So that energy, that density of
that emotion had gone in there

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and materialized.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:90%
I also had major anxiety.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.330 align:middle line:90%
I had a bladder issue.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So the bladder issue
and the anxiety issue

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:90%
was because I didn't feel safe.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So the environment that I was
in as a child, it wasn't safe.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I was walking
around on eggshells.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
There was banging and noises and
yelling and screaming happening.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And not only that
on the outside.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
On the inside in the womb,
I'd split from my soul

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.310 align:middle line:84%
because I was so
scared of where I was.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Where was I?

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Before I came into this world
I was in a nice, loving,

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
blissful state, and then I
anchored into this 3D body

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and this low vibration, and
I didn't know where I was.

I remember when
I first met Roxy,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:84%
she'd never go to sleep
without me or her checking

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that every single window
in the house was closed,

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:90%
all the doors were locked.

and then I'd go, oh, Pete,

can you go and check the
doors and windows in case

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:90%
I've forgotten one?

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I grew
up feeling scared,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
so that was my conditioning,
feeling scared constantly.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't be at home by myself.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And I had to double check,
make sure all the doors

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:90%
and windows were locked.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:84%

not being safe was manifesting

The underlying issues to do with

if you know what I mean.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we couldn't
drive too far down the road

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
without needing to stop
for a toilet break.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%

the house, wherever we went.

>> Or if we went to the airport,
we'd need to pee before she

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:90%
in uncomfortable situations.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, buried within
her, the poor soul,

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
was all these things
from her childhood

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:84%
where she was constantly on
edge, constantly nervous.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So it manifests itself
in claustrophobia.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
It manifests itself in
nervousness and anxiety

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
in unfamiliar situations,
because inside

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
was her brain and her whole
system going into panic,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.600 align:middle line:84%
going into coping,
going into shutdown

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:84%

where we can all access

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and remote view our

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
our light body up there, for
the healings, for the wisdom.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But we have to connect
to that four-part being.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
the emotional engine.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So clearing the emotion
and opening up the heart.

us to do so we can elevate

with the Pleiadians more

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and more, and going up to the
ship and working on herself,

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and getting the Pleiadians to
work on me and other members

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:84%
of the family, eventually
just in passing,

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:84%
a complete stranger said,
I'd like to experience that.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And Roxy did her very first
med bed session with this guy

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and took his light
body up to the ship.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And he was so delighted.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:90%
He was so happy.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And what we've got
to the point now

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
is we teach people how to
do that for themselves.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And this ability to be able
to connect, clear, heal,

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and then connect more to who
we really are and to the divine

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
is something that everybody has
the ability to be able to do.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So after we started dropping
the density and healing through

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:84%
those layers, we started
elevating our frequency

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and seeing higher and
higher dimensional beings.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.390 align:middle line:84%
We're able to move
easily to this starship.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiadians were like,
well, this is not only for you

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:90%
guys.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can access this
information and this healing

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
modality, and come and
communicate with us

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:90%
and meet their star family.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were encouraging
us to share this information

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.610 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
we're doing now.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:90%
So everyone can access this.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:90%
This is not only for us.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can access
this vibration,

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
communicate telepathically
with these beautiful brothers

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and sisters from the stars,
and use this med bed technology

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
to elevate themselves,
heal, and return to love.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:84%
The planet and the
souls on the planet

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
are all in their
masculine because

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:90%
of the uncertainty in life.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Feeling scared, vulnerable,
stressed, anxiety.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
All of that is covered then
with this blanket, this facade

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:90%
of this strong warrior.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's too heavy weighted in
the masculine, which has dropped

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:90%
the density on the planet.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So now we're here for
the Great Awakening.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:84%
We're all to heal
and return back

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:84%
into balance, which is the
masculine and the feminine.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And through this
journey, I've certainly

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:84%
moved back into my
divine feminine, which

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
has been really, really
nice, enjoying motherhood,

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
being a female, being
looked after and cuddled

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:90%
like a little girl.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all moving yourself
back into that love state

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that we all need to move back
into to balance this planet out

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and to raise the vibration
of humanity together.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:84%
When we move into
our divine feminine,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:90%
we become more vulnerable.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
We're not in our ego defending
and protecting ourselves.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.690 align:middle line:90%
We're feeling our emotions.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
We're learning to trust
again, to connect again,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
to open that heart and
that soft part of us.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And we start to just really
enjoy life and connect in

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:84%
our marriages once
again, with our children.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And the planet is just starting
to flourish now because there's

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:90%
beauty and love and connection.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This guidance from the
Galactic Federation for humanity

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to help themselves from the
inside out is actually really

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:23.010 align:middle line:84%
the divine wisdom behind this
Pleiadian med bed process.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It's because as people
clear their traumas,

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:84%
as they clear those
false beliefs,

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
as we raise our vibration, that
vibration has a ripple effect.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing
is we're raising

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of the
collective consciousness.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We're vibrating together
as a human collective back

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.390 align:middle line:84%
into the divine feminine,
back into the masculine.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But now it's balanced
for the Great Awakening.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>> There is that saying.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:84%
The rising tide lifts
all of the boats.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:10%
As we connect and we heal
ourselves as individuals,

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:10%
you become like
that rising tide,

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:10%
helping to lift the
consciousness of the collective

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, supporting
Pachamama, Mother Gaia, as she

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:90%
shifts and she changes.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is that
time of ascension.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:90%
[INTENSE MUSIC]

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:27.205 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.205 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:10%
In an experience to the
ship, the med bed technology

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:10%
will highlight the
root causal problems

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:10%
in their field for us to heal
and let go of or forgive.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:10%
>> The energy of the ship is
very much an energy of being

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:10%
warmly welcomed.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:10%
It's because the
density of being human

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.850 align:middle line:10%
is actually a lot
further removed

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:10%
from that light body, that
oneness, and that unity

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.860 align:middle line:10%
that we actually would expect.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.770 align:middle line:90%
It is a big shift in frequency.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:90%
