00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.211 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.960 align:middle line:10%
>> On the planet, at the
moment, there is a wide range

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness that human
beings are experiencing.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the Earth is actually
in lack, in survival energy,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
moving up to stress,
and coping, and trying

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:10%
to get by with everyday life.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:10%
As we're moving into higher
levels of consciousness,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:10%
we are still operating as
individuals at different levels,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.580 align:middle line:10%
but those levels do affect the
consciousness of the whole.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So higher vibrational
beings actually

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:84%
have the effect of
counterbalancing or raising up

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of many lower
vibrational beings on the Earth.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:10%
So this is the ripple effect,
the lightworker, the wayshower,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:10%
the individual who is committed
to this, the inner work,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:10%
and actually living
the inner work.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Rather than just being
inspired by the process

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:10%
or inspired by the information,
but actually taking the time

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:10%
and putting in the effort to go
within, to clear the density,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:10%
to clear the blocks,
to become the highest

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:10%
vibrational expression of
themselves in their day

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:10%
to day life, by those people
raising their vibration up.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Those individuals
are helping to have

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that ripple effect on the
collective consciousness

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>> When we talk about the
dimensions and start at the 3D,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:10%
the third dimension, we can
find behaviors like fear, worry,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:10%
stress, emotional baggage,
like shame and guilt, anxiety.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
They all dwell in
the third dimension.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a low frequency,
it's a slower vibration.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So when a person is trying to
ascend or to become a higher

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
vibrational expression
of themselves,

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
3D issues stored within
themselves can actually be like

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
anchors, heavy blocks
weighing them down.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So if they were all caught up in
3D emotions of shame, or blame,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
or anger, resentment, if
they have that buried within

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
their being, physically,
emotionally, mentally,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
those things are going
to actually be inhibiting

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
a person's ability to raise
their vibration and connect more

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
to source, to the divine, to
these higher vibrational beings.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the importance
of doing the inner work.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Another way to see what's
playing out on the planet

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and where we are at.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We are sitting in
the third dimension

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
separation and division.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:90%
There's coercion.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You can see, over the
last couple of years,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:90%
the separation has enhanced.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:10%
And that's just a
clear indication

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:10%
that we're in the
third dimension

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:10%
right now as a
collective civilization.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> While a person might be
down in the lower levels of 3D,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
like really suffering in
survival, guilt, shame, anger,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
a person still may be constantly
seeking validation outside

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
They may be continuing to chase
and satisfy cravings or desires,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
all in an attempt to make
themselves feel constantly

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in what they would describe
as a pleasant state,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to avoid their pain.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to look
at their imperfections.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And really, they're completely
disconnected from any real soul

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:90%
growth.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had
a situation where

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
you're walking down the street
or you're in the grocery store,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and for a moment,
you look around

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that
99% of people around you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:90%
are completely asleep?

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know that
they've got a soul, let alone,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
that they are on a soul journey.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So often, we laugh about
going to the supermarket

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and having a ripple effect of,
amongst the people that are

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
shopping in the
same store as us,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and one thing that Pete and
I love to do is just throw

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
energetic love bombs at other
people and help them elevate

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:90%
and activate their soul.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you smile
at them as you pass them,

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and some people smile
back, and that's beautiful.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.187 align:middle line:90%
There's a nice connection there.

00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't even
know what you're looking at

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:90%
or why you're smiling at them.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So we gently throw a beautiful
love bomb over to their heart.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:84%
These things are just being the
light, smiling, and being kind.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And often, we talk
about being kind.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
How can we be kinder
to people in our life?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like being more
caring, more compassionate,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
smiling at people, waving, thank
you, and just being appreciative

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.720 align:middle line:90%
of this human experience.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Much of the population is
caught up in egoic desires,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
looking to climb the corporate
ladder, looking to get more,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
accumulate more things in order
to make themselves feel better

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:90%
about themselves.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
It's sometimes called
the illusion of Maya

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:84%
or the illusion of the separate
self, where people falsely

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
believe that they're not
really connected to anything

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:84%
outside themselves,
their immediate thoughts,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and their reactions
to the emotions

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that stir up within
them, constantly

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
trying to avoid or appease
their emotions within,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and constantly being
guided by thoughts that

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:90%
are completely out of control.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
They're like a victim
of circumstances

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
outside their control
throughout their life.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:10%
So they search for meaning, the
bigger car, the bigger house,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:10%
the bigger job title,
whatever that may be,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:10%
is all falling under this
illusion of separateness.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So as we raise our vibration,
we're moving into the fourth

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
We're not actually
going anywhere,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
we're staying right here,
but we're multidimensional.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming our
multidimensional self.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So some aspects of the fourth
dimension, some behaviors

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
or feelings that you could feel
are things like compassion.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.370 align:middle line:84%
You move into
awareness or become

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
the observer of situations from
a more of an aerial perspective.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Your rate of vibration
has also enhanced.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
You've dropped some density from
the lower three energy centers.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, you've
opened up your heart.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
That's an indication that
you're moving into the fourth

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
dimension, and you're moving
and bridging between 3D and 4D.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So as we start to
become more self-aware,

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
we start to become the observer
and learn to do the inner work,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.920 align:middle line:90%
and the vibration goes up.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:10%
And we move from what Rod
describes as service to self

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:10%
into service to others,
unity, consciousness,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:10%
realizing that we are all
one and that this level

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:10%
of the heart, often, the trap of
moving into 4D consciousness is

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:10%
it can be quite overwhelming.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:84%
You realize that so many people
are still completely asleep

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and there can be this
overwhelming need or desire

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:90%
to try and wake everyone up.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But very quickly, what an
awakened soul starts to realize

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:84%
is it's not for us
to wake anyone up.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's on their own journey.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone's looking
for 5D consciousness.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the goal at the
moment in the physical body.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
We can be physical in
the fifth dimension.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:90%
We can look at bliss state here.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
We can feel love and
unconditional love

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:90%
for all things.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:84%
We see the infinite
creator in everything

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
that exists in this
state of consciousness.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:84%
We're feeling like
we can manifest

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:90%
and have flow in our life.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:84%
We're not using our
will, and our ego,

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and our force to push anything
through, to create anything.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:90%
It's ease and flow.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:90%
It feels abundant.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:90%
It's overflowing.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And everything's
flourishing in our life

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
when we reach this
state of consciousness.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
>> So as a person works on
themselves and becoming that

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
best version of themselves,
focusing on their own personal

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:84%
growth and journey or
understanding their own unique

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:84%
oneness, that can become very
inspiring for those observing

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
the shift and the change
that goes on within a person,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and inspire others to want to
make that shift and that change

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.476 align:middle line:90%
or to awaken themselves.

00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So what's playing out
right now on the planet?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:84%
We're moving from 3D to 4D
into 5D through this experience

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:90%
of vibration.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't go up in
a straight line.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
We're moving like
waves, up and down.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Some days, you're up.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Some days, you're down.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But we need the down to scoot
back up into a higher vibration.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Not only is your soul wanting
to ascend this lifetime,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
the whole planet
and solar system

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
wants to go back into a
comfortable, loving state

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We've got beautiful
help from the sun.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The sun is being giving
off solar flares,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's been
rapidly increasing

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:90%
over the last couple of years.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
You might have felt this
in your day to day life.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
These ascension symptoms could
be something like feeling dizzy,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
feeling out of
sorts, frustrated,

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe heightened senses of
anxiety and stress or panic

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:90%
attacks.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Or you could feel just
so tired that you're

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:90%
sleeping 12 hours a night.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Your body is metamorphosing
into a light body.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the way of
ascension as we

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:84%
climb through these
dimensions, we're

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:84%
transferring from this dense
body into a light body.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So imagining that
ice cube, you're

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:90%
the ice cube in physical form.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you ascend and
vibrate higher and higher,

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
the ice cube is
melting and vaporizing

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:84%
into higher states
of consciousness,

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
into your light body,
into your energy body.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we're going
to transcend from 5D into 6D

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:90%
into 7D.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And these beings
coming aboard the ship,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:90%
they're showing us this.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a mirror of
our future selves.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Them coming down and
connecting in with us

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:90%
is our goal in the future.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not to be rushed through.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:90%
We're to enjoy the journey.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And every step of the
journey is a gift.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The divine wants us to
be in the present moment.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the gift, the
present from God.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the gift to be
in this now moment,

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:84%
being present with the children,
being present with your loved

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.680 align:middle line:84%
ones, with your family members,
putting that phone down and just

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
seeing the infinite
creator in all things.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So this can move people
into this state of going,

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:90%
so what do I need to do?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:84%
What can I do in
order to achieve this?

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we are looking
at this as something to conquer

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:26.680 align:middle line:84%
or something to achieve, the ego
has crept into this awakening

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And we can get, sometimes,
caught in the spiritual growth

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
egoic state of looking
at the information being

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
some key to achieving
some end result.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I need to do another course,
or read another book,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:84%
or follow a
different guru, or go

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
through some sort of
amazing experience.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So then, perhaps,
I will be there.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Then I will have
reached the destination.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But really, what we
need to do is actually

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
just surrender in that
moment and realize

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:84%
that we were never really
disconnected in the first place.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And by identifying
the spiritual ego

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that we
don't need to do more,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to do
anything in particular,

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
we need to work on
being more, embodying

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:84%
more of these wonderful
spiritual principles

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:90%
that are often all around us.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, the person
can be an absolute expert

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:84%
on forgiveness or an
expert on resentment.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And they've read the books,
they've done the course,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
they're passionate
about the idea.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But in the actual moment,
when someone wrongs them,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.140 align:middle line:84%
they can be very quick to anger
or have a very short fuse.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:10%
And they haven't actually
embodied this principle

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:10%
that they know so much about.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So part of what we really
need to do in order

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:84%
to get the vibration up is to
take the inspiration of the idea

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and then the
understanding of the idea,

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:90%
but turn that into action.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And when a person
asks, well, how

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
does that translate
into my day to day life,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
it is to demonstrate that higher
vibrational state in your day

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:90%
to day activity.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
That's saying, by their
works, you shall know them.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Be the light.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:84%
You can be the light standing
in the grocery store,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:84%
or pumping gasoline, or when
you're at the workplace,

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
through how you demonstrate
your spark, your enthusiasm,

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:84%
your high vibrational
state to other people, so

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
through compassion,
understanding, empathy,

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.540 align:middle line:90%
joy, that zest for life.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
We start to demonstrate
these spiritual principles

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
without really needing
to say anything.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Hence, by their works, you shall
know them or even what you are

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:90%
speak so loudly.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:84%
People can't hear
what you're saying.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
You're a living example, helping
the people quite naturally,

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:84%
then go and say,
what are you into?

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:90%
What are you reading?

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
What daily principles are you
putting forth in your life

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:84%
because you just seem
so happy, so content.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:84%
That is part of what it
means to be the light worker,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
be the wayshower, and to embody
being at peace with oneself.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, more than ever,
higher vibrational beings

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:84%
are helping humanity,
helping the individuals who

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:84%
are willing to do this
work, actually assigning

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
their free will and
exercising choice to go within

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and to want to be the best
version of themselves.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
They're being helped by the
higher vibrational beings,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.180 align:middle line:84%
but we're also being helped
from the planet itself

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:90%
and from our solar system.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The sun is helping
us all ascend.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:84%
This solar system is going to
work in symphony once again.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been recordings
of solar flares, large sunspots.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:10%
And the measurements are showing
vast amounts of radiation, gamma

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:10%
waves, hitting planet Earth
and affecting the frequency

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:10%
and the vibration of people.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> These solar flares
are coming off the sun.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming
into our atmosphere

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
to help elevate the planet and
elevate the souls on the planet.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:90%
That's you and me.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:90%
The sun wants us to heal.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It wants us to elevate into
higher states of consciousness.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of awakened and
sensitive souls are noticing

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
these shifts and these changes
often referred to as ascension

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:90%
symptoms.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So while we're getting help
from higher vibrational beings,

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:84%
the planet and our
solar system together

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:84%
are all moving us in this
direction of ascension.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> These solar flares are
coming into our atmosphere.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're rated
very, very high

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:90%
over the last couple of years.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
That shows us that
we are really moving

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:90%
into this great awakening.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:84%
This mass awakening
is about to activate

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:90%
across the whole civilization.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Scientists rate these solar
flares coming off the sun

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
into our atmosphere
a certain way.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It goes A, B, C, M, and then
X being the most powerful.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
numeric value that

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.060 align:middle line:90%
gets put next to these letters.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:10%
So 0 to 10, 10 being
the most powerful again.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:10%
So an A1 isn't
actually that strong,

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.360 align:middle line:10%
but it's significant
enough to move vibration

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:10%
into our atmosphere.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we have an X-rated
solar flare coming off the sun,

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:90%
it's big news.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel it.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel this vibration
through your being.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It's helping you activate more
and more of your light body self

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and elevate your soul into
higher states of consciousness.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:84%
>> So as we move through
this awakening journey,

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
one of the things we all need
to do is to constantly check

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in with ourselves and
become more and more aware,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
become the observer, the
observer of ourselves,

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
what's coming up within
us when we get triggered,

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
when things aren't in flow, and
continually ask ourselves what

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:90%
rather than why.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:90%
What is this trying to show me?

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:90%
What is this trying to teach me?

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Rather than the old pattern of,
why is this happening to me?

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not fair.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When you raise
your vibration,

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
you start to experience this
flow state and this amazing

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:90%
essence of life.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
You move with the universal
energy in your day to day life,

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:84%
like getting the car park
just at the right time

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
or intercepting someone that
you haven't seen for a while.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
All the answers, the
knowings and that information

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:84%
comes through your crown
and into your heart.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you
feel it in your heart.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just at the right
time every single time.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
That is what flow state
really feels like.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Some days, you can
feel so enlightened,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and everything's amazing,
and you love everyone.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And then a few days later,
you could be down in the pits.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:84%
We've experienced this
as well, but we know,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
it's just a wave,
coming and going again.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:90%
What's coming is going.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Trust the universal energy.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It's to feel something, to
get triggered by something,

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that you're
going to come out of again.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:84%
It's all an experience,
the good and the bad.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the expression
of the divine,

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:90%
the duality of the divine.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
The lower frequencies
and the higher

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
frequencies all balance
out in your everyday life

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to achieve higher awareness,
higher wisdom and knowledge

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.625 align:middle line:90%
for your soul's growth.

00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
By being the best version of
yourself in every single day,

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you start to embody these
higher frequency energies,

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking in the shoes
of a higher vibrational being.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to feel this
way in your everyday life,

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
to feel free, to feel
love, to feel happiness,

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:90%
or the feeling of excited.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Ever feel like you want to have
more excitement in your life?

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
This is what this 5D
consciousness looks like.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> As our awareness goes up, and
we become more aware of self,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and we clear out the
unhealed parts of ourselves,

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a whole lot easier
to embody heart-brain coherence,

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:84%
kindness, compassion,
empathy, understanding, joy.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:10%
When we go into 3D situations,
when we're doing 3D tasks,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:10%
we feel like a
complete waste of time,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:10%
doing the grocery shopping,
doing mundane tasks like

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.690 align:middle line:10%
the laundry, answering emails,
instead of sitting there with

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:10%
that feeling of, oh, my gosh, I
didn't come in here to do this.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Realize that in
those moments, we can

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
still embody and enjoy
the gift of being human,

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:90%
of having this human experience.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So by embodying these
principles that we've

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
discussed in this
series, to help you grow,

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.800 align:middle line:84%
it will have a ripple
effect on others

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:84%
when you smile at them,
when you try and activate

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and throw a love bomb
at them, that energy

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:90%
will emanate out of you.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you
have to do nothing.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
They will feel that
vibration and start

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
to shift into these higher
vibrational energies as well.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And when your heart is
in that state of gratitude

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and self-awareness, when
someone is unreasonable,

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
when they are difficult, it's
very easy to be aware of them,

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
or to move into that energy
of, Forgive them, Father.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.880 align:middle line:90%
They know not what they do.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to realize
that they are just broken,

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:84%
they're hurting, they have
unhealed parts of themselves

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:84%
within that they
need to work on.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:90%
The divine wants to help you.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The universal energy
right now on this planet

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.090 align:middle line:84%
is helping us all evolve
and elevate our frequency.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in
flow state, you know

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that you're in that
high vibrational essence

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:90%
of your soul.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a lower
vibration, you'll know it.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:84%
You'll have
objections coming up,

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
humps and bumps in the road
in your day to day life.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
But the key is, how do you
respond to those events?

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you react and honk that
horn when someone cuts you off

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:90%
in traffic?

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Or do you allow them to flow
in front of you and say,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:84%
maybe they've got
somewhere important to be,

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's an emergency?

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:84%
What is this trying to
teach me in this now moment?

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
To be calm, to be centered,
to respond rather than

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:90%
react in those moments.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So as part of this series, we
want to throw out the challenge

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to you by baring our soul
and by sharing our journeys,

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:90%
our difficulties.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
The hope is to inspire you to
go within, to do the inner work,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and to live your highest
vibrational expression,

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
to live a life of joy, and
happiness, and inspiration.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Human life is here to be
enjoyed and experienced

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:90%
in all its wonder.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about being the best
version of you and being honest

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:90%
with how you feel.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
The emotions as they
rise, acknowledge them,

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:90%
move into them, inquire.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Ask your higher self, show
me, teach me, guide me.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to know
about this situation that's

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:90%
coming into my life?

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> We want to be someone
who lives with spontaneity.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Who tries different
things on the menu?

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Who does crazy little things?

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's silly, and
sings to the mop,

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and lets the children see
the example of, perhaps,

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:84%
their parent, their aunt, their
grandmother, their grandfather,

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:04.520 align:middle line:84%
expressing the joy of
life, and taking the time

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
to be more self-aware, and
putting the device down,

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
telling the people that
we care about how we feel.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:84%
If there are unhealed
relationships in our life,

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:84%
working on forgiving
all of those people that

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:84%
need to be forgiven, opening
up and expressing to the people

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that we really love and
care for in our life,

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:84%
telling them
exactly how we feel.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So often, we think the
thought, but we never

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:84%
take that vital step of
actually opening and expressing.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And guys, that's the key.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the icing on the cake.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's easier to do
it, the more healed you

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:90%
are within yourself.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of people feel alone.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.980 align:middle line:84%
They feel separate,
but we're not alone.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.620 align:middle line:84%
The Galactic Federation
is here to show you

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:90%
that we will never separate.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.730 align:middle line:90%
That is the illusion of the 3D.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:84%
We are all together
in this now moment.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And you have access to
this galactic consciousness

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.400 align:middle line:84%
right now to your star
brothers and sisters

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:90%
that love you dearly.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
We can all access this
information and these feelings,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:84%
these consciousnesses
of love, and beauty,

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and bliss, and really
grow together in harmony

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:90%
with the universe.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.350 align:middle line:84%
We are all so very lucky to be
in this human form right now,

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:84%
having front row seats of the
greatest show in this universe.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:90%
We are here for a purpose.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:90%
You are as well.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:90%
You're here for the mission.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:84%
The great awakening is
going to be beautiful.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have a ripple
effect on this solar system,

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:84%
this galactic, this universe,
and go out from there.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So as we become the
best version of ourselves,

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:84%
we radiate that high
vibration out to other people.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And the quality
of their life all

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
improves from us being the
lightworker, the beacon,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:84%
the wayshower, which
is then helping

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:90%
us to fulfill our purpose.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
That overarching
reason as to why

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:84%
we came in here in
the first place,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to discover the divinity, the
love that is actually buried

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:90%
within, waiting to come out.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:90%
