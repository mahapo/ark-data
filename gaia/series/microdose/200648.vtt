why observations,

have been a fairly
healthy movement

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
to investigate these things.

But now we see these
lingering chemtrails.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
During the Vietnam

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:10%
it could impose worldwide.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
ceremony by weather
manipulation.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So if the Chinese can do this
and if there's technology to do

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
it, why would we believe
that weather events here are

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:90%
natural?

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It's no longer experimental.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Weather modification is
a full-blown operation.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The military industrial
complex knew that they needed

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:84%
to have the weather on their

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:90%
and that was the goal.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:10%
>> To control the weather is
to control the population.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:10%
And weather as a

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:10%
been sought after by militaries
going back many, many decades

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:10%
even prior to World War II.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:90%
So there's no debate.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:90%
There's no dispute.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:90%
This is not a theory.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.005 align:middle line:90%
It's not conjecture.

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
These programs that are
going on, plain and simple.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.943 align:middle line:10%
And anybody who truly
does any investigation

00:04:28.943 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:10%
will get to the bottom
of this, and it's

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.528 align:middle line:10%
the biggest elephant in
plain sight in human history.

00:04:33.528 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:10%
>> What they're doing is selling
these programs to the public

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:10%
as a way to mitigate
global warming,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:10%
and the theory is putting these
chemicals into our sky will

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:10%
actually reflect sun back into
space and thus cool the planet.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:10%
The problem with this is at
night, the aerosols actually

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:10%
act as a blanket
and they trap heat.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
In the past 10 to
15 years, we've

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
seen a great increase
in nighttime highs.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So the question
really remains, what

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.935 align:middle line:84%
is the objective
of these programs,

00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and why would they
implement something that's

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:90%
so damaging to the planet?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:10%
>> There have been over
160 US patents filed,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:10%
starting in 1891, that pertain
to weather modification.

array of technologies,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:84%
often referred to collectively
as geoengineering,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:84%
that potentially could help
reverse the warming effects

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:90%
of global climate change.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
One that has gained
my personal attention

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
is Stratospheric Aerosol
Injection, or SAI,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
a method of seeding the
stratosphere with particles

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that can help reflect the
sun's heat in much the same way

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:90%
that volcanic eruptions do.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
On the geopolitical side,
the technology's potential

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.170 align:middle line:84%
to alter weather
patterns and benefit

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:84%
certain regions of the world
at the expense of other regions

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
could trigger sharp
opposition by some nations.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And as with other
breakthrough technologies,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
global norms and
standards are lacking

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.110 align:middle line:84%
to guide the deployment
and implementation of SAI

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and other geoengineering
initiatives.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that this
or similar proposals have been

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:90%
in operation for years?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what are they
spraying, and could it

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:90%
have an impact on our health?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, what we see in the sky
matches what geoengineers deny

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
they're doing, but state
that they want to do.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:10%
And what we're finding
around the world

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:10%
matches not only what
geoengineers are proposing,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:10%
but a number of
geoengineering patents

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:10%
designed to specifically
spray these toxins

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:10%
into the planet, which
are aluminum, barium,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:10%
and strontium.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Things that are connected
with heavy metals are

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:90%
skyrocketing.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Record amounts of
asthma, autism,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and Alzheimer's is being
found in younger and younger

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:90%
patients, even in their 50s.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So something is going
very, very wrong.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Without question, it is
in the air that we breathe.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:90%
So we're inhaling this.

>> Is this a failed project in
an attempt to save the planet

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.130 align:middle line:84%
from global warming, or
an operation to manipulate

the weather for profit

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:90%
and what can we do about it?

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.350 align:middle line:10%

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:10%
to light.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We have flyers on the front

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.973 align:middle line:10%
stand up and say, no, these
programs will come to a halt.

00:07:23.973 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:10%
>> We have to first
clean the air,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:10%
but we have to clean ourselves.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:10%
We need to heal
ourselves from this.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So there are
different vitamins I

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.100 align:middle line:84%
take that will block
heavy metals in the body,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and there are
supplements, herbs that I

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
use to chelate heavy
metals out of the body.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not as debilitated
anymore by this.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We will be able to restore
our fragile planet that's been

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:90%
molested in so many ways.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:90%

There is compelling
data that suggests

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
chemtrails may be evidence of
a clandestine climate control

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
program, although if
this program does exist,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
it is still unclear why
it is kept so secret.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Since 1996, chemtrail
activists have

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:84%
been dismissed by mainstream
news, science, and government

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
agencies, but this
movement seems

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
to be gaining momentum in
the general public in light

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:90%
of the climate debate.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:10%
Exploration into
this topic is unique,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:10%
as it is available to everyone.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:10%
